4,27,Candace,"(on phone) I'm totally sunk, Stace! I've been working on Jeremy's birthday present for months, but it's not even close to as good as I want it to be. (Cut to reveal she's working on a popup book showing their first kiss.) Ugh! Lame!"
4,27,Stacy,"Oh, come on, Candace. You're overthinking this. (The cashier puts a watermelon on the tread.) Jeremy'll love anything you make. What's your worry?"
4,27,Candace,I just wanna do something really special to show Jeremy how much I care. Something way over the top! Something that defies the laws of physics and excedes the boundaries of the imaginatio— (realizes what she's talking about) Oh no.
4,27,Stacy,"Oh, yes."
4,27,Candace,No no no no no! Anything but that!
4,27,Stacy,You're going to have to ask for help from...
4,27,Candace,Phineas and Ferb. (Puts her head in her hand like she has a migraine.) Uggggh.
4,27,Phineas,"Well, now that we've ironed out the bugs in our fusion-powered popper, the popcorn is nice and fluffy...and no longer glowing, so we're good to go. (Candace comes in mumbling under her breath.) Uh, what's that, Candace?"
4,27,Buford,"Lemme talk to her, guys. I speak sullen."
4,27,Buford,Candace messed up and now Jeremy's birthday is ruined.
4,27,Candace,Hey!! You completely misinterpreted what I said!
4,27,Buford,Nuance.
4,27,Phineas,"So what's goin' on, Candace?"
4,27,Candace,"(sighs) It's Jeremy's birthday and I wanna do something really special to show I care and you guys are good at doing, you know, what you do, and, well, all I have is this scrapbook and I don't wanna blow it so can you help me, huh? (gives Phineas the book)"
4,27,Phineas,"Wow! This is great! It's like a blueprint! Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today!"
4,27,Candace,"Great! Start workin' your magic and, no pressure, but it's gotta be PERFECT!!!"
4,27,Phineas,We'll do our best!
4,27,Candace,(mumbling) Thnk yu.
4,27,Buford,"Oh. She said, ""Where's Perry?"""
4,27,Candace,You have got to work on your sullen!
4,27,Major Monogram,"Hey, there, Agent P! Well, it's Horrific Movie Night at my house where a bunch of agency guys get together and make fun of ridiculously bad movies."
4,27,Carl,He's always the guy shushing everybody.
4,27,Major Monogram,"Well, there's a time for fun and a time to pay attention."
4,27,Carl,Pfft.
4,27,Major Monogram,"Anyway, Agent P, when we went to rent tonight's horrific horror classic, Night of the Living Torso, it was already gone. In fact, all the movies within the horror genre throughout Danville have been checked out, which is definitely a bummer, and could possibly be evil. Go check on Doof and see if he's bogarting those movies...uh, before 6:30 if possible. (Agent P raises his arms up, and a pair of mechanical arms give him his jet pack. He blasts off.)"
4,27,Linda,"Candace, I'm headed out."
4,27,Candace,"(trying to not sound suspicious) Okay, Mom."
4,27,Linda,What's with the box?
4,27,Candace,"Oh, uh, nothing. I just wanted to see what this stuff looked like outside."
4,27,Linda,"Candace, is this a ploy to get me to go outside to see what the boys are up to?"
4,27,Candace,"No!! Er, I mean, uh, no need. (pushing her mom out) Just go out and, uh, feel free to stay for a while. Stay out all afternoon in fact. Heh-heh, heh."
4,27,Linda,"Reverse psychology. Nice try, hon. Glad to see you changing it up. See ya later."
4,27,Candace,"Okay, bye."
4,27,Candace,So here's all the Jeremobilia I could find. (gives the box to Phineas) Now what?
4,27,Phineas,Cool! (Ferb gives Candace a camera) Now just go around town and take pictures of all the Jeremy-related places and things you can. The camera will transmit them back to us to incorporate into our mega-interactive scrapbook-aganaza.
4,27,Candace,"No problemo! Candace is on field duty, peace!"
4,27,Phineas,"I'm sorry, were you gonna say something? (Isabella shrugs.) Okay."
4,27,(Cut to,)
4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(sighs, pauses the movie) Isn't that always the way? Right at the exciting part, that's when the doorbell rings...or, y'know, a platypus breaks it down. Anyway, behold the Worst-Fear-inator! (pause) What? (Doof tilts his head. POV shot from Doof as he sees the popcorn cart is blocking the inator.) Oh, yeah, I-I guess from your point of view, it's a little difficult to see. Lemme just get this outta the way for you. (He pushes the popcorn out out of the way.) There we go. Now, in my never-ending pursuit of domination, I discovered that the best evil rulers used fear to keep people in line. So to get into the right headspace, I did what any logical evil scientist would do: rented all the scary movies in Danville for research. Even the lousy ones like Dead Batteries, which is actually better than its prequel, Batteries That Work, which was...just a bunch of...portable electronic devices...functioning properly."
4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Once I was terrified, I was able to analyze the fear-based synapses of the brain and extrapolate some wonderful data!"
4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Basically, I shoot someone with the machine, and whatever they are afraid of actually appears...in real life! Whadaya say, Perry the Platypus? Ya like being a guinea pig? Actually, you'd look kinda cute as a guinea pig. I mean, I wonder if you'd be teal. I bet you would. I bet you'd be a cute little teal guinea pig. Something to think about for the future. Anyway, Perry the Platypus, let's fire this baby up and see what scares you. (He presses the button activating the inator.) 'Cause, y'know, it's gonna materialize right over there. (A green beam hits Perry.) Alright, so what are you afraid of, where is it? (looks around) What the hay? Nothing? (A business card slips through the ropes. Doof takes the card and reads it.) ""Perry the Platypus: O.W.C.A. agent - Fearless."" Huh. That figures. I guess you'll just hafta...hang around! Ha ha ha! Oh, wait, this one's better: I'll just leave you here because you're all tied up! Ha ha ha! W-W-Wait, one last one, you're gonna love it: See ya later because it isn't my tail that's upside down! (No response.) No? No no, I shoulda stuck with the first two, you're right."
4,27,Candace,"Ooh, score! That awning is the same color as Jeremy's eyes! (snaps the photo) Aaaand...daffodils! Just like the ones he gave me on our third date! (Snaps the flower.)"
4,27,Phineas,"Incoming. Perfect! Same color as Jeremy's eyes! Huh, flower. I'm drawin' a blank."
4,27,Ferb,"Daffodil, third date."
4,27,Phineas,"Riiiight...Now the machine will take the images, and print them into giant scaled-up form."
4,27,Buford,Nice touch! Smells like my grandma!
4,27,Phineas,I thought your grandma smelled like ant pheromones.
4,27,Buford,"Naw, that's the other one."
4,27,Phineas,These should really make Jeremy's Birthday Scrapbook-aganza a full sensory experience!
4,27,Buford,"(sarcastically) Great, just what I always wanted: to fully sense Jeremy."
4,27,Candace,"Okay, what else? Ah! (She walks up to a couple drinking outside a French café. She takes the man's mug.) 'Scuse. Hot cocoa! (Snaps the mug and sips.) Not bad, although Jeremy prefers it with a little more cinnamon. (Walks away.) I gotta make a note of that for the boys."
4,27,Man,"I guess my fortune came true. ""You will share your cocoa with a long-necked teenager."" See? Right there."
4,27,Woman,"Mine just says, ""Your boyfriend's gonna get a fortune cookie at a French café."""
4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Get ready, Perry the Platypus! The Tri-State Area's about to confront its fears! (Evil laughter from Doof. Another business card with mechanical arms and legs slips through the rope and crawls up to Perry's tail. A laser beam shoots through the robot and burns the rope down, freeing Perry. He kicks Doof.) Aaah! Ow ow! I landed on my jawbone, right under that weird...sticky-outy part under your ear! And my jawbone landed on the remote. Ah, Doof. (The inator activates and shoots Doof.) Okay, nothing bad will happen as long as I don't think about anything scary or... (A pounding on the door is heard.) Oh no! I couldn't help it, it just popped in there! It can't be! (The door breaks down revealing evil vending machine robots.) Vending machines are taking over! I said it could happen! No! Stay back! Stay back! Back! Flee! Flee! (Doof attempts to escape, but the vending machines grab hold of him.) No no no no! I'm not really hungry! Really! (Stutters) No no, not the tiny vanilla cookies! How long have those been in there?! (The machines force feed Doof a packet of vanilla cookies.)"
4,27,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, the scrapbook-aganza is complete! Plus, we got Love Händel to come in for a live soundtrack!"
4,27,Danny,"Okay, guys, performance level! (Strums the intro)"
4,27,Candace,I'm gonna need a test run so I can make notes.
4,27,Phineas,Sure. You're the boss.

4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(offscreen) No! No! Not that! Anything but the fake red licorice! It tastes like... (Doof grunts. Perry stops walking and figures he has to save Doof.) No! What possessed me to make such a horrifying inator?! (Perry jumps on the DVDs and hops onto the inator aiming it. He lands on the floor and hits the remote. The inator hits the vending machines. A giant nickel rolls by and the machines run for their lives.) Well, I guess now we know what scares vending machines."
4,27,Phineas,"Well, Candace, do you think Jeremy will like it?"
4,27,Candace,"(seriously) Yeah, I just have a few notes here. (Excitedly, as she reveals she drew a smiley face on the clipboard.) It's perfect! (gasps) I love it, guys! Iloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveitiloveit..."
4,27,Phineas,"(to Ferb) She had me at ""smiley face""."
4,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, you're back! (walking up to the inator) I am never setting that puppy off again. (He presses a button, and, as usual, the inator activates and aims across town.) Oops."
4,27,Candace,"It's really perfect! (The beam hits Candace.) I'm glad Mom's gone for the day 'cause my biggest fear is that this is just gonna fly away before Jeremy gets here. (car horn honks, Candace gasps) And there he is! (runs off) Woohoo!"
4,27,Baljeet,"Uh, did anyone else see that weird green beam?"
4,27,Buford,I wasn't gonna mention it.
4,27,Candace,Jeremy!! Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy Jeremy!!! You gotta see what the boys built in the backyard!!! (drags him)
4,27,Candace,(runs up) No no no! No no!! It's gone! My worst fear has come true! I totally blew it!
4,27,Jeremy,"Let me guess, you had your brothers build me something super cool for my birthday and now it disappeared. It's okay, I get it."

4,33,Carl,"Agent P, what do you think of his Father's Day gift?"
4,33,Major Monogram,"Yes, it's a lovely tie, but I'm not your father! (to Perry) Anyhoo, Doofenshmirtz has plans to gum up the entire Tri-State Area. And we need you to check it out. Good luck, Agent P."
4,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! If you think this is a sticky situation, you better hold on to that fedora. Behold, the Gum-Under-The-Shoe-inator! I took all the wadded up chewing gum in the entire Tri-State Area and fed it into this -inator. Yeah, I know, it's really unsanitary. Why don't people just throw the chewing gum in the trash? Huh?"
4,33,Doofenshmirtz,(sighs) Today just isn't my day. It's Father's Day. It's the hardest of the greeting card company holidays for me. My issues with Father's Day began back when I was a child.
4,33,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) Those were lean times for my father and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed.
4,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I know you've heard that one before, but...twice actually...but I really think that this is where my relationship with my father went awry."

(While he talks, Perry goes onto the computer and opens the Lawn Gnome Tracker app.) DAEHM23. If only there was some way to reunite him with, y'know, that specific lawn gnome, maybe he and I could start again. (Looks at the computer.) DAEHM23?! You found him with an online gnome tracker? Wow, there really is an app for everything now, isn't there? Well, let's see. It says it's still in Drusselstein! Now I can heal the old wounds between my father and me! (gets up and walks but is stuck to the chair) Oh, man that is one of my most brilliant ideas yet! (His pointy nose pops the huge bubble made from the gum.)"

4,33,Doofenshmirtz,Ah! I thought you were my father's lawn gnome.

Thanks for coming along, Perry the Platypus. Let's go home. (They walk away from the curb.) You are my rock. (Cut to a cannon.) And by that, I mean you're there for me, you're not made out of rock.

4,1,Major Monogram,"Carl, I'm freezing. Did you call that repair guy yet?"
4,1,Carl,"I left him a message, sir. I think he went to Aruba for winter break."
4,1,Major Monogram,"Lucky dog. It's cold in... Oh! Agent P! Didn't hear you come in. I have no idea what Doofenshmirtz is up to. It seems all of our computers froze. Isn't that right, Carl?"
4,1,Carl,(is seen with his hands inside an ice-encased computer) Tech support says everything is fine.
4,1,Major Monogram,"Well, I'm sure whatever Doof is up to, he's probably much warmer than we are, and that alone should be reason to stop him! Good luck, Agent P! (Perry salutes and exits his lair)"

4,1,Stacy,"Not now, Ginger. I'm busy."
4,1,Ginger,Don't make me open a can of whipped cream on you! Or however that goes.
4,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus! (on an ice chair holding a mug of hot chocolate) Come in! How do you like my evil igloo hideout up in the Danville Mountains? Would you like some hot cocoa? No? Then, how about a marshmallow! (Doofenshmirtz launches a giant marshmallow out of his cocoa mug, trapping Perry) Ha. Ha! Trapped you again! I think I figured out why I haven't been able to take over the Tri-State Area. I've been too much of a nice guy. Nice guys can't take over large metropolitan areas, except for Roger. But, we're not talking about Roger. I've got to get mean. (Doofenshmirtz slides his chair across the igloo's floor; his cocoa mug falls and breaks) I've got to get ugly and possibly hairy. (Doofenshmirtz's chair slides past a picture of the abominable snowman) I've got to learn to be more like the abominable snowman. (chair crashes; a cat screeches) So, I decided to build this! Behold, the Abominable-nat... The, the Abominama... The A-bom-in-a-ble-i-nat-or. See, I can only say it if I speak slowly. The Abominable... Inator. Oh look, if I, if I separate it, it works. The Abominable Inator! It makes whatever it hits bigger and scarier and hairier. Anyhoo, behold. (removes cover from the Abominable-inator, which is covered in a huge scarf and knitted cap; Perry looks unimpressed) Okay, I know what you're thinking: ""Why the silly little stocking cap and scarf?"" The truth is, I, uh... I had some yarn."
4,1,Dink,"And the blare of the buzzer brings down the metaphorical curtain on the scintillating second period of this titanic tussle as the grim, gritty gladiators vacate the frozen field of flailing, fighting flugelhorn to prepare for the third period of this tellican, turf-toes tower as the frosty defibrillators mill the frozen peems of icy... (gasps) Oh, man. I better go lay down."
4,1,Candace,"So when all the members of the offending team clear the defensive zone at the same time, the delayed offset call is negated."

4,1,Stacy,"(to Candace over the phone, reading from a rulebook) While the linesmen may call only obvious technical infractions. (to Ginger) Go away!"
4,1,Candace,"Obvious technical infractions. Go away. The player who committed the infraction is no give me that. No Ginger, I'm busy. I said give me that back. If you don't give that back to me right now, Candace, gotta go."

4,1,Linda,I'll be right back.
4,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Behold, Perry the Platypus, as I make myself abominable. (Doof presses the button on the -inator's remote. The -inator's beam bounces off the igloo and hits the marshmallow trapping Perry, causing it to burst and splatter all over Doofenshmirtz.) Ooh, it's all marshmallow-y and hairy. Not completely unlike summer camp. Apparently, you gotta aim this thing a little better... (the -inator shoots a beam directly at Doof's rear end) Whoa! Owww! Hmmm, something's not right in the hinterland. (his bottom suddenly becomes large and hairy, causing him to fall on the front of the sled) Yikes! Oof!

It's a world where the only way to survive is to play hockey while things blow up around you.

Now it's working. (several more pops are heard as Doof becomes completely abominable) Hey, not bad. A little hairy, but not bad. Now, to deal with you! (Doof grabs for Perry, who darts under his legs) Gotcha! Hey, where'd you go? (Perry tugs on Doof's back hair) Oh, there you are. (Perry beckons Doof to come closer) Yes?

Now normally, I'd be able to forgive this kind of thing because of your tireless dedication and spotless record to OWCA, but it's clear to me that you lost our security deposit and that is something I cannot forgive. I'm forced to relieve you of command. I'll take that... (rips off the first ""M"" on Monogram's uniform) and that! (rips off his mustache)"

As much as I like our little visits, you didn't need to come over. Actually, I'm not even trying to take over the Tri-State Area today. Y-You see, I have a problem. I am very fair-skinned. I don't know if you have noticed. I always have to use SPF 120 sunscreen even on a cloudy day or I'll burn. I mean, I'll actually burst into flames. And I got this whole crate on sale, and, and look, it's all 110 SPF! I thought I was getting 120! This is not gonna work. So rather than return this whole mess, which means I'd have to get in the car, drive down there, wait in line, then answer a bunch of questions about the delicacy of my epidermis, I'm just gonna move the Earth away from the sun just enough that the 110 will work. Simple. And to that end, I have created, tada!, my Shift-The-Earth's-Position-Further-Away-From-The-Sun-inator! Eh? I know. The name's a little cumbersome, but it's basically a tractor beam that uses the mass of Jupiter as an anchor to pull the Earth just slightly away from the sun to render my sunscreen effective. Eh. I guess my fortune cookie was right. I do tend to overcomplicate things. (picks up fortune) I wonder if that means these lottery numbers are--"

4,32,Baljeet,We should monitor the conditions in the upper atmosphere. I have a weather balloon.
4,32,Buford,Why would you have a weather balloon?
4,32,Baljeet,"Buford, you have full-sized molds of all of us."
4,32,Buford,We should use Baljeet's weather balloon!

4,32,Candace,What are you talking about?
4,32,Stacy,"Candace, everyone knows you're terrified of spiders."
4,32,Candace,Pfft. Spiders? Are you kidding? Why would I be afraid of an itsy bitsy SPIDER!?!?!?! AAAH! AHHH! GET IT! GET IT! EW EW EW EW EW!!

4,32,Baljeet (cont'd),...we are in for a moderate cold front that shows absolutely no signs of subsiding.

4,32,Phineas,"(pointing to a splitscreen monitor) That's why we enlisted the help of other kids around the world. See? There's Floria and Abdul on Mount Kilimanjaro, Ganesh and Kabul on Mt. Everest, Vsevolod and Vanko at the top of Mount Elbrus, and Lupert and Eporwold on Mount Haggenhuge. Eporwold's the goat. While they finish fine-tuning, we'll move our rocket up to Mount Danville."
4,32,Candace,"Then everyone turns them on, and the Earth goes back to the way it was?"
4,32,Phineas,"Sort of. But the burners all need to be synchronized through this control panel. Otherwise, we risk ripping the Earth's crust apart. Do you think you could stay here and help control the thrust?"

4,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, technically, it's my fault. But if you weren't sitting around in a cold alley whining to rats and feeling sorry for yourself, this whole situation wouldn't have gotten so out of control! Before, I was a regular evil scientist, and now, suddenly, I'm part of this big organization of supervillains bent on world domination! I'm not comfortable with that! The point is you should've been there to stop me! And you weren't! (He puts two pennies into Monogram's tin cup and walks away.)"
4,32,Monogram,"(picking up the cup) Huh, two cents."
4,32,Monty,There's the warehouse!
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,Come on!
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"(grunts) Oh! Guys, little help?"
4,32,Monty,"What do you say, Perry? Think we can take 'em? (Perry and Monty run up to the goons.) Alright, you goons! (Two more goons appear behind the first two goons.) (to Perry) You take two and I'll take two. (Giant footsteps are heard, which is, clearly, not good news.) Great. They have a cave troll. Run!"
4,32,Monty,"Perry, split up!"
4,32,Monty,"Thanks, Carl."
4,32,Monty,"Wow, good work, Agent P!"
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,Great! Now we get all his health!
4,32,Monty,"You play way too many video games, man."
4,32,Candace,"Come on, Candace, you can do this! What's a couple little spiders compared to the fate of the world? (climbs back down) Oh, who am I kidding?! I need support! (She dials her phone.) Stacy, I really need your help!"
4,32,Stacy,"(on phone) Sorry, Candace, no can do."
4,32,Stacy,I have to stay put until the swelling goes down.
4,32,Candace,(on phone) Are you okay?
4,32,Stacy,"I'll be fine. But until then, you're on your own."
4,32,Candace,"(hangs up) Well, she's no help. I'm gonna have to do this myself. (climbs back up) It's just you and me, attic. You and me... (climbs back down) and about TEN HUNDRED GAZILLION SPIDERS!! OH, I CAN'T DO THIS!!!"
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I've had time to think it over and we need to put the world back. I, for one, do not want to live in a perpetual winter! (pushes Rodney) Scoot over, Rodney."
4,32,Rodney,"Your betrayal doesn't surprise me, Heinz. (pushes Doof) Step aside!"
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,(fighting over the controls) Wh-What are you doing?
4,32,Rodney,"Just to show you who's boss, I'm going to move the Earth even further from the sun!"
4,32,Candace,"There's Ferb's box way over there. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't go way over there!"
4,32,Phineas,Candace?
4,32,Candace,"AAAAAAHHH! Phineas, how did you get up here?"
4,32,Phineas,I'm using the Ferbographic technology.
4,32,Phineas,What's taking so long? Did you find the box?
4,32,Candace,"Well, it's right over there by all those spider webs. Be a pal and grab it for me, will ya?"
4,32,Phineas,"What? No, I can't pick it up. I'm a hologram. You have to do it."
4,32,Candace,But I can't!
4,32,Phineas,"Well, what's the matter, Candace?"
4,32,Candace,It's my fear of spiders. I've been trying to overcome it all day.
4,32,Phineas,"Well, that is a valid fear. You should be cautious around some spid—"
4,32,Candace,"Phineas, you're not helping!"
4,32,Phineas,"Come on, you've already done so many brave things. Remember when you helped us recuse Klimpaloon? And what about that time you got that really big bird to quit pecking our house? Or when you climbed up on the motor of our baguette boat after I gave you a similar pep talk?"
4,32,Candace,"Yeah! You know what? You're right. (Climbs all the way up.) If I could do that, then I should be able to walk across the attic, right? It's being silly. Heck, I don't even remember what I was afraid of."
4,32,Phineas,Spiders.
4,32,Candace,AAAAH!!! (climbs back down)
4,32,Phineas,"Candace, you forgot the box!"
4,32,Monty,There they are! They're headin' for the roof! We gotta get up there and stop them from firing that inator!
4,32,Dr. Diminutive,"(with a pistol) Not so fast, Monty Monogram!"
4,32,Monty,"Take it easy, we don't want any (attempts to punch but misses) TROUBLE! (backs away) What?"
4,32,Dr. Diminutive,"Now that we have all of OWCA's agents, nothing can stop us!"
4,32,Monogram,(offscreen) That's where you're wrong! (emerges from the shadows)
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,Major Monogram!
4,32,Monogram,"I'm back! And I brought some help! (Agent Rat appears on his shoulders and whistles, followed by all of the escaped OWCA agents.)"
4,32,Dr. Killbot,"¡Qué lástima! (""What a Pity!"")"
4,32,Dr. Diminutive,Wait a minute!!!  (record scratch) This is the same brawl we had earlier!
4,32,Dr. Bringdown,So?
4,32,Dr. Diminutive,"Aw, I'm just sayin'."
4,32,Dr. Killbot,"La cabeza de medusa no es agradable para ver. (""Medusa's head is not pleasant to look at."")"
4,32,Villain #5,He's right! Let's get out of here!
4,32,Villain #6,"That's not what he said, but...yes, we should get out of here."
4,32,Phineas,"Candace, you're not giving up, are you?"
4,32,Candace,"No. (climbs back up) Today, I face my fear! Back off, spiders! Candace is in the attic!"
4,32,Phineas,(offscreen) Now we're talking!
4,32,Candace,"Ha! Take that, you little... (Several more spiders crawl down from inside the umbrella.)  AAAAHHH!!!"
4,32,Phineas,"Wow, I guess there are a lot of spiders up here."
4,32,Phineas,"It's all right, Candace. You're just gonna have to reach past that spider."
4,32,Candace,Are you kidding me?!
4,32,Phineas,"Candace, the fate of the world is at stake!"
4,32,Candace,"Okay, five-year-old me. Here we go. (She timidly sticks her hand into the box, only hesitating for about a second.) Gotta reach it! (The spider sticks out one of its legs.) A little...bit...further! (She grabs the fuse.) That's it! I got it!"
4,32,Phineas,"Great work, Candace! You go down and put the fuse in, I'll go back and tell the guys! (The hologram disappears, and then reappears.) And well done! (The hologram disappears again.)"
4,32,Candace,"In your face, arachnid!"
4,32,Phineas,"Candace did it, Isabella! She got the fuse!"
4,32,Isabella,"Um, Phineas, one of the main locking bolts came loose on the rocket, and, uh..."
4,32,Phineas,"Huh. Yeah, we should probably fix that before Candace puts the fuse back."
4,32,Rodney,"Oh, this is just ridiculous! You and I should just... (points somewhere) Oh, look! A Horse in a Bookcase!"
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,A what?
4,32,Rodney,Ha! Now to move the Earth into a new ice age!
4,32,Candace,"Why isn't this thing going in? What is it? ""Righty-loosey, tighty-whitey?"""
4,32,Buford,"Phineas, this thing ain't budgin'!"
4,32,Phineas,Candace? Candace?  (to Isabella) Why isn't this com-link working?
4,32,Isabella,The rocket is blocking the signal! We've got to get up there!
4,32,Rodney,There. I've disabled the reverse switch and the self-destruct button. So there's no—
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Nobody messes with my self-destruct button! (He sticks the mop's handle into the inizer and tries to lift it up.) You make a pretty good fulcrum there, Rodney."
4,32,Isabella,"Well, at least we're out of danger."
4,32,Phineas,We've gotta get the rocket in position or the planet could be torn apart!
4,32,Candace,"C'mon, you stupid thing! Get in there!"
4,32,Candace,It's in!
4,32,Candace,"(on radio) The fuse is in! Okay, I'm gonna fire up the engines!"
4,32,Candace,"It's not moving, Phineas! It's like something's resisting our jets!"
4,32,Phineas,"I was afraid of that! Listen, push the rockets up..."
4,32,Phineas,(on radio) ...above the red line!
4,32,Candace,"But, Phineas, you said that would be bad!"
4,32,Phineas,"(on radio) Well, there is a..."
4,32,Phineas,....slight chance of pulling the planet apart!
4,32,Candace,That's a bad thing!
4,32,Phineas,"It's our only chance, Candace! We should be okay if we just do it slow and steady!"
4,32,Candace,"Oh, just like the rabbit in the story."
4,32,Phineas,"Yes, exact— Wait, no! Like the turtle! Like the turtle!"
4,32,Candace,Slow and steady. Slow and steady. (She pushes the levers up slow and steady into the red and the rockets get more powerful.)
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"Look, Doofenshmirtz is trying to destroy the inator!"
4,32,Monogram,Come on! He needs help!
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"Hang on, sir!"
4,32,Monty,"Nice catch, Carl!"
4,32,Roger,I don't know what's going on anymore.
4,32,Candace,"Phineas, what's happening?"
4,32,Phineas,"Unless I've missed my guess, the Earth is moving again! You better shut down the rockets, Candace!"
4,32,Candace,Gotta get to the controls! Almost th— AAHHH! (She falls over backwards.)
4,32,Phineas,"It stopped. We're not moving anymore! Candace, you did it!!"
4,32,Candace,"What? I did? (She gets up to see that she pulled the plug.) Oh, what do you know? I did it! (She opens the door and smiles as she sees the snow melting.) Aw, summer. Welcome back! (The inator lands in the backyard and takes the control panel with it.) Yeah. Well, that's to be expected."
4,32,Monty,"Come on, Roddenstein! You're comin' with me!"
4,32,Rodney,"(to Doof) See ya later, Slouchy!"
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, well y— Ugh! I can never come up with anything quick enough!"
4,32,Monogram,"Doofenshmirtz, you just saved the world. Thank you."
4,32,Doofenshmirtz,"You're welcome, Francis. Put 'er there! (Monogram holds his hand out, but Doof pulls his away) Psych! (laughs) I'm still evil! (walks away laughing)"
4,32,Monogram,"Yes. Yes, you are."
4,32,Colonel Contraction,"Well, Monogram, nice work."
4,32,Monogram,"Thank you, sir."
4,32,Colonel Contraction,"Unfortunately, we're still not getting our deposit back on that rental hall and that's really broken the budget. I'm afraid we have to close OWCA."
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"Sir, why don't you start a new agency?"
4,32,Monogram,Good idea! What do we call it?
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"(checks his phone) Oh, looks like the name ""OWCA"" just became available! Oh, and so did their old building!"
4,32,Monogram,Great! We'll call our new organization that and move there!
4,32,Major-in-Charge Carl,"Good idea, sir!"
4,32,Monogram,"And to keep costs down, we're gonna have to cut some management positions. Colonel Contraction, your services will no longer be required."
4,32,Colonel Contraction,"Yeah, well, that's to be expected."
4,32,Carl,"I think this belongs to you, sir."
4,32,Major Monogram,"You keep that one, Carl. (He concentrates and instantly grows back his mustache.)"
4,32,Carl,"Welcome back, sir."
4,32,Lawrence,Everything's all right. We're all outside.
4,32,Saul,"Oh, sweet sunshine! (kneels to the ground) Terra firma!"
4,32,Lawrence,"Yes, well..."
4,32,Saul,(kisses the ground) Lovely top soil!
4,32,Lawrence,"We'll, uh, just be going then, shall we?"
4,32,Linda,"Bye, Saul!"
4,32,Saul,Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Ugh! Kissed a bug!
4,32,Phineas,"There she is, the hero of the day! Nice going, Candace! Hey, where'd the command center go?"
4,32,Candace,Probably the same place the last one went.
4,32,Baljeet,"You really did a good job, Candace."
4,32,Candace,"Yeah, and not only did we save the world, but I did everything I promised five-year-old me I'd do!"
4,32,Buford,Let's all pretend like we understood that!
4,32,Phineas,"Well, now that we have summer back, what should we do?"
4,32,Buford,Oh! Oh! I got an idea!

4,26,Buford,"Well, you know, the sun was in my eyes."
4,26,Isabella,"Buford, what's with the lack of effort?"
4,26,Buford,I'm just tryin' to be careful.
4,26,Phineas,You?
4,26,Buford,"Yeah, we're outta credit at the emergency room. My mom said if I break one more bone, she's gonna break the rest of them! Fairly sure that was hyperbole, besides, look how hard that hydrant is!"
4,26,Baljeet,"Well, maybe we could make our own fire hydrants out of soft foam rubber."
4,26,Phineas,"Hey, that's a great idea! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
4,26,Ferb,Seriously? That's it? A soft fire plug?
4,26,Phineas,"Well, yeah, attached to a giant revolving treadmill with a giant soft neighborhood containing soft obstacles."
4,26,Ferb,"Oh, yeah, okay."
4,26,Baljeet,Where is Perry?
4,26,Isabella,What did you say?
4,26,Baljeet,I was just asking where Perry is.
4,26,Isabella,Oh.
4,26,Baljeet,What did you think I said?
4,26,Isabella,"Uh, well, I thought you said...uh...nevermind. It was too weird."
4,26,Major Monogram,"Ooh, ooh, oh, get it off! G-Get it off! Ooh! Uh, just walked through a spiderweb. Don't you just hate that? Ya spend the rest of the day worried there's a spider on ya. (shudders) Gives me the willies. Anyhoo, our sources tell us there's a cowboy hat in front of Doof's building. Normally, that wouldn't be of any interest to us, since this is the week of the Danville Hootenanny, but it is a rather large hat and, in spite of its name, the Danville Hootenanny is a dignified affair. I wish I had more information, but Carl said there was a big bee by the surveillance equipment. So get out there, Agent P! Ooh! Carl, is there... (turns around revealing a huge tarantula on his back) is there a spider on my head?"
4,26,Carl,"(offscreen) No, sir. There's no spider...on your head."
4,26,Narrator,"Meanwhile, at the Danville Space Laboratory..."
4,26,Sign Painter,"Laboratory?! (makes angry noises, throws his hat to the ground and stomps on it)"
4,26,Linda,"Oh, Jack, it sure was nice of you to show Candace and me around. This satellite stuff is very interesting."
4,26,Jack,"No problem, Linda. I'm flattered you'd be interested in our humble facility, considering your background in astrophysics."
4,26,Linda,"Oh, yeah, uh, listen, that's kind of a secret, so don't—"
4,26,Jack,"Oh, I'm sorry."
4,26,Candace,So what does your father do here?
4,26,Jeremy,"Oh, he's part of a team that makes and manages recognizant satellites. They actually had a couple of rovers on Mars earlier this summer. But they suddenly stopped working. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
4,26,Candace,"(nervously) Uh, how would I...heh heh...what do you mean? Heh heh."
4,26,Jeremy,All right...Your Highness.
4,26,Candace,(gasp) Who told?
4,26,Jeremy,Stacy.
4,26,(Cut to Agent P parachuting to,)
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering why I'm cowering outside my lab. Well, day started like any other day. You know, ""how am I going to take over the Tri-State Area?"" But I suddenly remembered a movie that I saw long ago at a drive-in."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) It was called Night of the Felis. I knew right away that the old masters were onto something. Imagine taking something cute and enlargening it to frightening proportions. Brilliant! But in order to take over the Tri-State Area, I had to study with some other types of small animals, preferably, something that could fly. And I vowed to get right to work...as soon as the movie was over. The first thing I needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(in flashback) Eh?
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) I tried it out on my cowboy hat. It was a success! My ten-gallon hat had turned into a 2,000-gallon-hat!"
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(in flashback) Whoa! (crash!) Well, that's the end of that hat."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Next, I had to genetically modify a mouse so it could fly."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(in flashback) Ow!
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Then I decided it would be easier to just use a bat. So I ordered a retired stunt-bat from a low-budget bat circus that had recently gone belly-up. You know...the economy. I was on the precipice of Tri-State Area domination. At last, I had the ultimate creepy soldier! (Derek the bat squeaks) And then I remembered, I had a very mild phobia of bats."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(in flashback) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) I also had a mild phobia of shellfish.
4,26,Waitress,"(in flashback, offscreen) Here's your order, sir."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(in flashback, offscreen) Aaaah!!! Get away get away get away!!!"
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) But bats are worse.
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(in flashback) Scram, you flying gerbil! (Derek squeaks) Amscray! (Derek squeaks) You're making me miss the hootenanny!"
4,26,Norm,"(in flashback) Sir, I found your radio. It was embedded in the dashboard of your car."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(in flashback) Norm, don't just stand there! Do something about this bat! (The radio is thrown, and misses.) Really? That's your solution? Throw a radio at it? Whoa whoa! (cut to Norm about to throw a crowbar) Don't throw that! That's imitatable."
4,26,Norm,"(in flashback, picking up the inator) What if I hit it with this?"
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(in flashback) No no! Don't shoot it with that! That's my—
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) And I thought the bat was scary before when he was...tiny.
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"It was at that point that Norm and I decided to come out here. Plus the bat kinda looks like my cousin, Narthelliot, which, as you can imagine is weird for me. Isn't that about right, Norm?"
4,26,Norm,(crashed through a hole in the wall) It's even more horrible than it looks!
4,26,Phineas,Everybody got their helmets and boards?
4,26,Isabella,Yeah!
4,26,Buford,I'm ready!
4,26,Baljeet,I am ready!
4,26,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, fire it up! We're going to Foamtown!"
4,26,Isabella,Woo! Woohoo! Yeah!
4,26,(Song,"""Foam Town"")"
4,26,Jack,"And over here are the models of our robotically-operated rovers: the Mars rover, the Moonrover, and this is the Irish Rover."
4,26,Candace,You sent a rover to Ireland?
4,26,Jack,"Well, we had to test it somewhere."
4,26,(Song,"""Irish Rover"")"
4,26,Jack,"It took a couple of months, but we're finally starting to get some really great pictures back."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Thank you for the blanket, Perry the Platypus."
4,26,Vanessa,(offscreen) Dad?
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Vanessa? Oh, no! Vanessa, get out of there! (Crawling inside) There's a huge bat on the loose!"
4,26,Vanessa,"Really? (Sees Derek shrieking.) Wow, cool! It looks like your cousin, Narthelliot."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"No sudden movements or loud noises, Vanessa!"
4,26,Vanessa,"Dad, relax. It's just a bat. They just eat bugs."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,But it's a very big bat!
4,26,Vanessa,"Now, come on. J-Just stand up. It's time to face your fear."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, okay. (Derek snarls at Doofenshmirtz and grabs him in his mouth.)"
4,26,Vanessa,(hitting Derek) No no no! Bad bat! Spit him out!!
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, gross! (Derek grabs Doofenshmirtz with his feet and flies away.) Oh, yeah, this is much better!"
4,26,Vanessa,"Dad!! Oh, hey, Perry. I was wondering if you could help me. (Perry grabs his jetpack and activates it.) Thanks, Perry. You're a peach."
4,26,Bat-Looking Man,"So, what'd I miss?"
4,26,Vanessa,"Oh, hey, Narthelliot! We were just talking about you."
4,26,Jack,"Of course, even better than using a rover, we have these. We call them global surveillance satellites. No matter where you are on Earth, there's always one of these flying above you in orbit, streaming live video to us here."
4,26,Woman at Monitor,"That's right. Here's the outside of our building right now. And we can look up any location instantly. The Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal..."
4,26,Linda,So you could look down on anybody's backyard and see what they're doing?
4,26,Jeremy,"Pretty cool, huh?"
4,26,Candace,"Wow, that's gotta be handy for something."
4,26,Jeremy,And three...two...one... (points to Candace in anticipation of her busting idea)
4,26,Candace,What?
4,26,Jeremy,Really? Alright.
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Whoa! Oh, I get it! This is what it does! Flying through a hoop! That's what I get...for buying a bat...from a defunct...bat circus!"
4,26,Jeremy,"So, having fun yet?"
4,26,Candace,"Oh, you know I am. (Sips her drink)"
4,26,Jeremy,"You know, my dad goes on and on about the cafeteria here, and I think he's right. This food is..."
4,26,Candace,"(does a spit take and gasps) I've got an idea! My brothers are probably building something in our backyard right now, and we can use the surveillance satellite to catch them doing it! (runs off) Come on!"
4,26,Jeremy,I was wondering how long that would take.
4,26,Candace,"Just lemme punch in my address... (The backyard and Foamtown appears onscreen.) Omigosh, I knew it! Look at that thing!!"
4,26,Jeremy,Wow! What is it?
4,26,Candace,"it's an eye-in-the-sky bust! Come on, let's go get my mom! (they walk off)"
4,26,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, turn it off. Let's take a little break. (Ferb pulls the lever and the wheel stops rolling. Buford falls off of the wheel landing on his back.) You okay, Buford?"
4,26,Buford,I'm havin' the time of my life! Is anybody else hungry?!
4,26,Isabella,I am!
4,26,Phineas,C'mon! Let's go see what's in the kitchen. (The gang jump off the wheel.)
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh no! Oh no no no! Not again!!! (bang!) Ow, my head! (bang!) Ow, my head again! (bang!) Ow! Now I forgot math! (bang!) Ow! There goes social studies! (bang!) Oh, good, they're back! (Doofenshmirtz's head crashes into the giant bolt revealing the cogs, which loosen and cause Foamtown to roll away.)"
4,26,Candace,"This way, Mom! (motions toward the screen) See for yourself!"
4,26,Linda,"Oh, wow! It's our house! (the screen shows the empty backyard and the kids) And you can see the boys! And their little skateboards! (waves) Hi, boys!"
4,26,Candace,"They can't hear you, you know."
4,26,Linda,I know. (keeps waving) Hi! Whoo-hoo!
4,26,Phineas,"Hey, Foamtown's gone."
4,26,Buford,You say that like it doesn't happen every day.
4,26,Baljeet,And you say that like an angry old prospector.
4,26,Buford,What does that even mean?!
4,26,Baljeet,(walks away) I stand by that metaphor.
4,26,Old Coot,"Finally, Daisy, we're here. Our new home! Lotsa elbow room and no one to bother us! The last frontier! A place where a man and his donkey can— (Foamtown unravels.) Dangit! Come on, Daisy, we're headin' west."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, welcome to St. Louis! Now do something about this bat, please! (Perry shoots the inator at Derek and it shrinks back to its original size, leaving Doofensmirtz hanging in midair, then falling.) Aah!! Well, at least I lost my fear of bats!! (Doofenshmirtz crashlands into a shellfish restaurant.)"
4,26,Waitress,"(offscreen) Oh, it's you again."
4,26,Doofenshmirtz,(offscreen) Aaaah!! Go away go away go away!!!
4,26,Waitress,"(offscreen) Oh, just stop it."
4,30,Candace,"Hey, Stace, feel like coming over for some pre-bust strategizing?"
4,30,Stacy,No can do. Gotta babysit. Why don't you call Jeremy?
4,30,Candace,"Oh, he's doing some sports thingy. Eh, it's not my thing."
4,30,Stacy,"Ooh, a whole day without Jeremy and you're not obsessing about it? Who are you and what have you done with Candace?"
4,30,Candace,"Silly BFF, Jeremy likes me for who I am. It's like we're one. When I breathe in, he breathes out. His heart says, ""Knock knock"" and my heart says, ""Who's there?"" and the answer is, ""Us!"" (giggles) Remember those days when I was always panicking about (Phineas, Ferb and Isabella pass with baseball stuff) what he thought or what he would or wouldn't like? Ancient history."
4,30,Stacy,That was yesterday.
4,30,Linda,"Candace, I'm going to the store, do you need anything?"
4,30,Candace,"Nah, I'm good."
4,30,Linda,Okay.
4,30,Candace,"Oh, wait, I am out of toothpaste."
4,30,Linda,All right.
4,30,Candace,And deodorant.
4,30,Linda,Got it.
4,30,Candace,"Oh, and pimple cream, loofa pads, body tape, hair dye, cucumber slices, fungal cream..."
4,30,Linda,"You know what, why don't you just come along so I don't spend the whole day in the teen hygiene aisle?"
4,30,Candace,Someone has to be around to bust Phineas and Ferb!
4,30,Linda,"Candace, they're playing baseball. It's not exactly a punishable offense."
4,30,Candace,"Oh, but it will be! (shakes fist) It will be!"
4,30,Linda,"Think of it this way, Candace: the faster I shop, the sooner I come home to bust the boys."
4,30,Candace,"(getting out of the chair) What are we waiting for? (grabs her mom's arm) C'mon, c'mon! Chop chop!"
4,30,Stacy,Hello...? Hello?...Hellooooo?
4,30,Phineas,"Okay, Isabella, keep your eye on the ball. (She hits it.) Whoa! Great hit!"
4,30,Isabella,Power Hitter Patch: check!
4,30,Baljeet,Your analysis of the pitch's angle and trajectory was most impressive.
4,30,Buford,Only you can nerdify a great sport like baseball!
4,30,Baljeet,"Buford, hitting a baseball involves the basic principles of (graphics appear above his head) velocity, force and geometry."
4,30,Buford,"(offscreen) You're visualizing numbers in the air again, aren't you? (Buford pushes the floating graphics into the ground.)"
4,30,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We can use geometric algorithms to build the ultimate batting challenge."
4,30,Baljeet,(to Buford) Well?
4,30,Buford,It's not as bad when he does it.
4,30,Baljeet,(sighs) I cannot argue. So where is Perry?
4,30,Phineas,"Oh, he's at home. (Whip pan left to reveal Perry standing on home plate chattering.) He's not doin' much. What's over here?"
4,30,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. As you can see, I, uh, I've had a little shaving mishap with this defective electric razor. Just not comfortable with my eyebrows moving independently of each other."
4,30,Carl,"(offscreen) But you are rockin' the reverse mohawk, sir!"
4,30,Major Monogram,"Get with it, Carl! The hip kids call it a ""hawkmo"". Anyhow, Agent P, retail stores all across the Tri-State Area are reporting a huge influx of returned faulty items and, coincidentally, (shot of Doof whistling with an inator waiting on line is shown onscreen) Doofenshmirtz has been spotted at customer service counters. (Monogram reappears onscreen.) I have a hunch that these two unrelated things may just be related! Now go find out if Doofenshmirtz has anything to do with this! Also, find out if anyone is actually calling it a ""hawkmo"" and, if not, please get that started!"
4,30,Candace,"Ugh, this is taking forever! We'll never get home in time to bust the boys!"
4,30,Linda,"I'll tell you what, how about you shop for your own things and then meet me at the register?"
4,30,Candace,"Ooh, great idea! (runs off)"
4,30,Candace,"Hygiene, here we are! Okay, lip wax, pimple cream, fungal cream... Wow! Running out of all my most embarrassing personal hygiene products on the same day. Ooh, right, deodorant! Oh, now, which Ducky Momo deodorant did I use? Hmmm... (Takes one off the shelf and looks around) Well, there's only one way to be sure. (Uncaps the deodorant and sniffs. She puts it back on the shelf and smells her own armpit.)"
4,30,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace! Whatcha doin'?"
4,30,Candace,"Uh, heh, hey, Jeremy, um...yeah...I'm just trying to reach the top shelf."
4,30,Jeremy,"Allow me. (He reaches up top for something, while Candace pushes a basket away) Here you go, one nose hair clipper. Do you want me to put it in your basket?"
4,30,Candace,"No, I mean (nervous giggle) That's not my stuff! That's my Mom's. I'm shopping for my Mom. Yeah, heh... my mom has really unruly, uh, nose hair! Yeah, really bad, okay? Uh, yeah, I...I was just on my way to the, uh... (whip pan right to where Candace is looking, cut back to Candace pointing at the sign) ...the water sports section."
4,30,Jeremy,"I didn't know you did water sports, 'cause I'm going to the Extreme Water Park today. Wanna come?"
4,30,Candace,"Yeah, cool! Y'know, 'cause I'm so down with the ten-hanging and whatnot. (giggles) Yeah."
4,30,(Cut to,)
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Aha! Consider yourself marked down! Handy little shopping device, isn't it? Anyway, you're gonna love this segue, Perry the Platypus! All of my broken inator parts were messing up the feng shui of my apartment. (Whip pan to a Chinese guy pushing a bonsai in a vase out of the way. Cut back to Doof.) Thanks, Larry! (To Perry) My feng shui consultant. To keep my chi in balance, I came up with this. Behold! The Back-to-the-Store-inator! Now instead of waiting in those ridiculously long lines at the return counter, I scan each item (he scans an item and it disappears) and presto! It's transported back to the store where I bought it!"
4,30,Counter Guy,Ow!
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"And here's the best part, Perry the Platypus: I get a cash refund deposited directly into my pockets. No banking necessary. (A cash register is heard dinging as several coins appear in Doof's pockets.) The only flaw is that the refunds come in pennies. Y'know, sometimes, I don't really think through the functionality of these things."
4,30,Jeremy,"(offscreen) Wow, this place is intense! (Cut to Candace and Jeremy on surfboards at the top of a water slide.) You ready, Candace?"
4,30,Candace,T-T-Totally. (She giggles nervously as she looks down at the bottom.) Who in the world designed this?
4,30,Ride Operator,"Couple of kids, actually. One had a triangle head."
4,30,Candace,"Wait, what? (The ride operator releases the surfboards and we hear Candace scream.)"
4,30,Jeremy,Woohoo!
4,30,Phineas,"Welcome, sports fans! We have a great game for you today!"
4,30,Isabella,(overexcited) It's the most extreme batting experience ever!!!
4,30,Phineas,The game is simple: Each level is worth ten points. The higher the level the harder it gets. The first one to hit the target at the top wins!
4,30,Isabella,It's survival of the fittest! A test of wills! Only one contestant will survive!
4,30,Phineas,"No, no, no, (chuckles) everyone will survive."
4,30,Buford,"You're goin' down, dweeb!"
4,30,Baljeet,I will beat you. It is a mathematical certainty.
4,30,Isabella,It's extreme!!! It's EX-TREEEEEME!!!
4,30,Phineas,"I don't know how extreme it is. It's, you know, big but it is still just a batting cage. Let's...not oversell it."
4,30,Isabella,"Gentlemen, start your engines!!"
4,30,Phineas,"No, no, they...don't have engines. (Cut to Ferb next to an automatic pitching machine labeled the Lob 9000.) Oh...Oh, I guess Ferb...Ferb has an engine. Forgot about that."
4,30,(Song,Extremely Extreme)
4,30,Candace,Ugh. Hello?
4,30,Linda,"(angrily) Candace, I've been waiting at the checkout line for a half hour! Where are you?"
4,30,Candace,I'm at the extreme water park with Jeremy.
4,30,Linda,What?! And it never occurred to you to let me know?!
4,30,Candace,"Sorry, Mom."
4,30,Linda,"Well, I expect you to be home by the time I get back to put everything away!"
4,30,Candace,"Yes, Mom. Ugh!"
4,30,Jeremy,Wanna go again?
4,30,Candace,I gotta go home.
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, very resourceful, Perry the Platypus! Using coupons to cut prices! Hey! (Perry jumps on the inator and it activates.) N-N-Not my baseball card collection! No!"
4,30,Counter Guy 2,"Yes! I told you genies were real, Sheila...wherever you are."
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, man, you have no idea how much that was worth! (Kaching!) Although, judging by the jingling— (Perry hits him) Ow!"
4,30,Isabella,Buford and Baljeet are tied!
4,30,Phineas,And Buford steps up to the batter's box!
4,30,Isabella,"Folks, you can cut the tension with a child-safe knife!"
4,30,Phineas,Here comes the pitch! Yes! Looking good. Looking great. Looking fantastic! (The ball misses the target.)
4,30,Isabella,Denied!
4,30,Buford,Ugh!
4,30,Phineas,Baljeet eyes up the target as he steps to the plate. Readies himself for the pitch. And...Wow! What a trajectory!
4,30,Isabella,But not enough power!
4,30,Phineas,A disappointed Baljeet walks away.
4,30,Isabella,"Oh, it looks like this game could go into sudden death!!"
4,30,Phineas,It could just be a tie.
4,30,Isabella,"No, sudden death!!!"
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, man, not my new flat-screen! (Kaching!) Hey, no way! I paid way more for that TV! (Doof falls backwards and breaks a part of the inator with his back. The machine malfunctions and goes haywire zapping randomly.) Hey, wha? Ow! Ow!"
4,30,Carl,(offscreen) I would like to return this electric razor.
4,30,Major Monogram,"Are you sure ya read the instructions, Carl?"
4,30,Buford,And you're showin' me boring math equations why?
4,30,Baljeet,"Buford, these equations show that if we combine your brawn with my brains, we can conquer the final target together!"
4,30,Buford,Do my ears deceive me? Are you sayin' we should work together?!
4,30,Baljeet,I know! My ears cannot believe it either!
4,30,Jeremy,Looks like we made it back before your mom.
4,30,Candace,"Yeah, sorry to have to rush— (gasps) I knew Phineas and Ferb were up to something! (Linda's car horn honks.) Mom's here. (She somersaults out of the car.) Just in time to bust the boys. Mooom?!!"
4,30,Linda,"(gets out of the car) Don't poke the bear, Candace! You're in enough trouble as it is."
4,30,Candace,"But, but, Mom—"
4,30,Linda,"Now let's take these inside before the frozens turn int— (realizes the empty trunk) Oh, shoot! I must've left the other bag at the store."
4,30,Candace,"Mom, just turn your head, and look up! (The car drives away) But...but...but... (Jeremy approaches Candace) but it's right...there!"
4,30,Jeremy,Are those batting cages?
4,30,Candace,"(Grabs him.) Come on, Jeremy, (runs to the backyard) there's still a chance to bust them."
4,30,Buford,"Dis betta work, dweeb!"
4,30,Baljeet,Just follow the trajectory I plotted out and I promise you will hit the final target! We can do this!
4,30,Buford,Optimism makes me angry!
4,30,Baljeet,(offscreen) Use it!
4,30,Phineas,(offscreen) Here comes the pitch!
4,30,Isabella,Whoa! This might be the big one!
4,30,Phineas,"Folks, it's the power hit of the evening! But is it gooooood? (The ball hits every level in the cage and finally goes in the target.) It's goooooooood!!!!!"
4,30,Isabella,Whoo!
4,30,Buford,Yeah! Yay!
4,30,Buford and Baljeet,Ahhhhh...
4,30,Ferb,Oooooo...
4,30,Phineas and Isabella,Ahhhhh...
4,30,Jeremy,"Awww... You'll bust 'em next time, tiger."
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"(offscreen) Y'know, chasing's not much of an option with my pants full of pennies. (Cut to inside to reveal Doof's pants pretty much about to explode.) Ah, well, live and learn. (An inator beam fires, Perry uses a picture of Doof to deflect it and it fires at Doof. His clothes disappear, but his underpants and pennies don't.) 'Least you hit my clothes and not me. I wonder what happens if a person— (Another beam hits Doof.)"
4,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Drusselstein. Hmm. Curse you, Perry the Platypus, and my wretched, wretched life."
4,30,Phineas,"Wow! Way to go, guys!"
4,30,Baljeet,I guess we can work together after all.
4,30,Buford,I hate to say you're right...so I won't.
4,30,Baljeet,Fair enough.
4,30,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry!"
4,30,Ferb,Safe at home.
4,30,Candace,And what a waste.
4,30,Jeremy,"Hey, the day's not a total loss. We had a great time at the water park. Wanna go back tomorrow?"
4,30,Candace,"Uh, I have a confession to make. The only reason I said I liked extreme sports was because I was embarrassed that you caught me buying all that hygiene stuff for myself."
4,30,Jeremy,"Aw, nothing you do could be that embarrassing."
4,30,Candace,"Oh, Jeremy. (They hug. Candace farts.)"
4,30,Jeremy,"Candace, was that you?"
4,30,Candace,"It's a normal bodily function, Jeremy. Get over it. (walks away)"
4,30,Jeremy,"(follows her) Wait, wait, I thought it was cute!"
4,24,Phineas,"Wow! Looks great, Dad!"
4,24,Lawrence,"Thank you, boys."
4,24,Phineas,"Come on, Ferb! We have work to do!"
4,24,Candace,"(walking in the background carrying her costume) Nice costume, Dad! See ya after the party!"
4,24,Lawrence,"Oh, yes, you have fun at the castle party tonight. (putting the mask on his head) If you need anything, your mother and I will be here scaring the sugar out of the little trick or treaters."
4,24,Linda,"Well, how do I look, dear? (Lawrence makes gorilla sounds and bangs his hands on his chest.) Oh, no, a gorilla!"
4,24,Major Monogram,"Okay, Agent P, who do I look like? Huh, whadaya think? (Perry simply stares) C'mon! Carmen Miranda! Y'know, you really should watch more old movies."
4,24,Carl,"(entering, also dressed as Carmen Miranda) Sir, I found your dosimeter. It was—What are you doing?!"
4,24,Major Monogram,"Great googly moogly! Is that what I look like?! Wow, suddenly I feel ridiculous. Nevermind, Carl, you can have it."
4,24,Carl,(exiting) Sheesh.
4,24,Major Monogram,"Moving right along: Sorry you have to work on Halloween, but just get out there and see what Doof has planned. I'd give you more information, but, obviously, I've got to find a new costume. Thanks a lot, Carl!"
4,24,Monty,"(on phone) Well, hello, Vanessa."
4,24,Vanessa,"Hey, Monty, what are you up to?"
4,24,Monty,I'm just doing a little freelance for my dad. What's up?
4,24,Vanessa,"I happen to be throwing the biggest, baddest, Halloweeniest bash ever! It's tonight and I think you should come."
4,24,Monty,"A costume party? Hey, that means we can actually be seen in public together and no one will know."
4,24,Vanessa,That's the plan! I'm checking out my Queen of the Vampires costume even as we speak.
4,24,Monty,Oooh...
4,24,Vanessa,It's pretty cute.
4,24,Monty,"Great, I'll be there! I'll be dressed as the Scarlet Pimpernel."
4,24,Vanessa,The Scarlet what?
4,24,Monty,"You know, he wears a big red hat with a feather in it. You should watch more old movies."
4,24,Vanessa,"Well, you know, it's a little known fact that vampire queens love Pumpernels."
4,24,Monty,Pimpernel.
4,24,Vanessa,"Yeah, whatever, OWCA boy."
4,24,Monty,See ya tonight.
4,24,Monty,"Sorry, Agent M. You're on your own from here on out."
4,24,Agent M,Ohhhh....
4,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, goody, trick or treaters."
4,24,Trick or Treaters,Trick or treat!
4,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, lessee, what do we have here? Class dunce with a fake scar, and you must be the Princess of Meatland...and...uh, oh, uh, Upset Rooster Head. And what are you supposed to be, a kid in a sheet? (The ""kid in the sheet"" takes off the sheet to reveal:) A platypus in a sheet? (He puts on the fedora) Perry the Platypus in a sheet?! Do I -- well, uh, that's perfect! Wait, wait, I was hoping you would— (Perry twists Doofenshmirtz's arm) Ow!! Whoa whoa whoa whoa, I'm being sincere! There's no trap, no inator, just come over here, you gotta see this. It was delivered today. (They walk to the balcony to reveal a castle turret outside.) I had to sign for it and everything! (Cut to outside to reveal a rather ancient castle next to the D.E.I. building.) It's a real castle with...with a moat! Who delivers a moat?! How'd they even get that on the plane? It's from my Great Aunt Henrietta Hawkenschpit. She left it to me in her will. L-Listen to this. (reading the will) ""To Heinz Doofenshmirtz, You are my only nephew, except for Roger and I hated him."" See? See why I liked her? ""Therefore, I leave you my castle and hidden inside is a very large treasure!"" Huh? (puts on reading glasses) And look! There's a little treasure map with clues! Wanna help me? (no response) Oh, come on! It'll be fun! Take off your secret agent hat just for tonight and put on your adventure hat! (Perry takes off his fedora and puts on a similar looking fedora.) That's my guy! Treasure ho! This is gonna be fun!"

4,24,Vanessa,"(offscreen) Welcome to my castle party! Here's a mask. Lacie, wow, great costume!"
4,24,Lacie,This is a...costume party?
4,24,Knight,Sir Grant of the Goth Table has arrived.
4,24,Vanessa,"You look great, Sir Grant. (gives him a mask) Dragons beware!"
4,24,Candace,(also dressed as a vampire queen) Vanessa?
4,24,Vanessa,Candace!
4,24,Candace,"Whoops! I guess your party's gonna have two vampire queens! What are the chances, right?"
4,24,Stacy,(leaves) I'm gonna go change.
4,24,Candace,How did you ever pull this off?
4,24,Vanessa,"Well, my dad gave me permission to use his castle and then all I had to do was call the best party planners in town."
4,24,Phineas,"Ferb, you go get the 4:40 junction box hooked up behind the riser, and I'll check up on the pumpkin crudities."
4,24,Candace,"Et tu, Vanessa?"
4,24,Vanessa,"I had to. This is a big night for me, my boyfriend's coming. Oh, here he is right now."
4,24,Scarlet Pimpernel,"Ooh, a vampire! It's a good thing I have my neck covered."
4,24,Vanessa,You're not my boyfriend!
4,24,Scarlet Pimpernel,"Whoops. Heh heh. Sorry, I thought you were my—"
4,24,Candace,"Jeremy, it's me, Candace!"
4,24,Jeremy,"Ooh, a vampire! It's a good thing I have my—"
4,24,Candace,"Yeah, heard you the first time."
4,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, the first clue is in the letter. Let's see here:"
4,24,Phineas,"These scalloped cheese slices should be staged directly across from the crackers. But overall, nice work. (He approaches Isabella dressed as Cinderella.) Hey, look at you! You're Isabellarella."
4,24,Isabella,"If I lose a slipper tonight, you know where to find me."
4,24,Phineas,"(walking away, pointing at something) Ooh, that reminds me..."
4,24,Isabella,"(""accidentally"" losing a slipper) Whoops!"
4,24,Phineas,(offscreen) ...there's some water on the floor over by the sally port.
4,24,Baljeet,"Buford, it is so hot in here! Can I please have some punch?"
4,24,Isabella,(saunters past) You don't wanna drink that.
4,24,Buford,"Y'know, I think we have the best castle party costume."
4,24,Irving,"(offscreen) Hey, Buford, look at me - (he is dressed as a castle) I'm a castle...at a castle party! Get it? Heh? Heh?"
4,24,Buford,"Yeah. Hey, Windsor, your drawbridge is down!"
4,24,Irving,"Oh, my. (raising his drawbridge) How embarrassing."
4,24,Vanessa,"Monty should've been here by now. (Another Scarlet Pimpernel approaches her.) Finally...wait, who are you?"
4,24,Scarlet Pimpernel 1,I'm the Scarlet Pimpernel.
4,24,Scarlet Pimpernel 2,As am I!
4,24,Scarlet Pimpernel 3,Same here.
4,24,All Scarlet Pimpernels,We are all here!

4,24,Major Monogram,"It's alright. (His visor drops on his eyes and he pushes it back up.) Monty, is that you?! With the daughter of my sworn enemy?! It can't be!!

4,18,Candace,And I have sodas. What else do we wanna bring over your house?
4,18,Stacy,Doesn't matter. I doubt we'll not be able to eat while we're watching this movie.
4,18,Candace,The Grievance. So scary no one over the age 45 will even watch it!
4,18,Stacy,It will be even scarier 'cause my family's out for the day and we will be alone at the house.
4,18,Candace,Great!
4,18,Stacy,"Candace, are you sure you can handle this? (They go out to the backyard.) It took me four days to pry you out from under the bed last time we saw a scary movie. (outside) What? What are you looking at? Oh no."
4,18,Candace,Phineas and Ferb! What are you guys up to?
4,18,Phineas,It's a surprise for Isabella's birthday!
4,18,Candace,A surprise...
4,18,Stacy,Here we go again.
4,18,Candace,...for Isabella's...
4,18,Stacy,Give me those sodas. (She grabs the sodas Candace was holding)
4,18,Candace,...Birthday.
4,18,Stacy,See ya. (She walks off)
4,18,Phineas,"Building supplies? Check. Guest list? Check. Perry? Hey, where's Perry?"
4,18,Stacy,"(Still leaving) Yeah, where does that platypus go everyday?"
4,18,Major Monogram,"Agent P.? (The lights flicker on) Ah, there you are. What do you think of the new motion sensor lights we've installed in your lair. (The lights go off again) Um... Agent P. try flailing your arms about that should- (Agent P. does so and the lights turn on) There we go! Now, Doofenshmirtz has been driving around town in some sort of truck that turns inanimate objects, like parking meters, into bugs. Eww. I want you to-- (The lights go off in where Major Monogram is) Really? Carl, I'm waiving my arms, why aren't the lights coming back on?"
4,18,Major Monogram,"That's not funny, Carl."
4,18,Phineas,"Okay, time to commence operation INAP."
4,18,Adyson,(To Candace) That stands for Isabella's Natal Anniversary Party.
4,18,Candace,I know what INAP means. Just get to the dangerous part I'm readying the phone.
4,18,Phineas,"Okay everyone, we need to carry all this stuff over to Isabella's backyard, so we can set it up for--"
4,18,Isabella,"Hi, Phineas. What'cha doooin'? You're not planning something for my birthday, are you?"
4,18,Phineas,"Don't look, don't look, don't look! Nothing to see here."
4,18,Isabella,Phineas! But all I really want for my birthday is-
4,18,Phineas,"Don't ruin the surprise! (He laughs nervously) Buford, get her out of here."
4,18,Buford,You got it. (He throws a bag over Isabella and carries her out)
4,18,Isabella,But what I real-
4,18,Buford,"I've carried a lot of squirmin' bags in my time, but this is the first time I knew who was in it. (He walks off)"
4,18,Isabella,Augh! What I was going to say was all I want for my birthday is some alone time with-- (motions to Phineas) Never mind. (She walks out)
4,18,Baljeet,You wanted to be alone with this bag?

4,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the platypus? It's no use trying to break through my protective bubble. It's platyproof-poof. I mean, oh you know what I mean. Anyway, you're probably wondering what I'm doing, driving this evil bug bus around town. I just got to thinking about all the things that bug me. Portable outhouses, high voltage signs. ""Danger High Voltage"". I'll decide how much voltage I can take! That's why I created the Bugs-me-inator. It turns whatever bugs me into bugs. And, since I can't stand bugs, I'm protected from them inside this bubble. (Perry points to a bug inside Doofenshmirtz's bubble) Huh? Oh, that's on the outs-- Ow! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off! (Doofenshmirtz open the bubble to let the bugs out) Wait I'm not ready! (Perry punches him, causing him to spin around his bubble) Whoa, whoa whoa. Right to the point huh? You know Perry the Platypus, more than anything, you bug me. (He fires the -inator at Perry, who dodges it, making the beam, instead, hit one of Doofenshmirtz's shoes) Ah! My shoe! Ow Get off! Get off! Get off! Ow! (Doofenshmirtz launches himself at Perry, but Perry redirects him back into his bubble, spinning him again.) Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Boy I really got to rethink the design on this think. By the way, you know we're on a runaway bus careening at high speed with no one at the wheel, right?"
4,18,Stacy,"(To the movie) Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. You went in there. Oh, gross she brought thousands of tiny bugs into the house. What could be worse than that? (Doofenshmirtz's bus crashes into Stacy's house) Big bug! Ahhh! (Stacy hides behind the couch) OMG! Perry! What are you doing here?! And why are you wearing a hat? Look out! (Doofenshmirtz flies onto the couch) And who's this pharmacist?"
4,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Really? Really? W-why does everyone just stampede to that conclusion? Other people wear lab coats you know. Why, why don't you say, ""Oh look a rocket scientist."" Or a veterinarian?"
4,18,Stacy,Are you a veterinarian?
4,18,Doofenshmirtz,No... But that's not the point.
4,18,Phineas,"Check it out. (Isabella's massive cake is seen being wheeled in.) We made your favorite, a red velvet cake, with a little surprise."
4,18,Baljeet,"Ooh, I hope they do not have a male dancer popping out of it."
4,18,Buford,"They asked, but they couldn't afford me."
4,18,Phineas,Will you do the honors Ferb?
4,18,Phineas,(To Isabella) Make a wish.
4,18,Isabella,(In her thoughts) I wish for time alone with Phineas.
4,18,Holly,(To Candace) What are you doing?
4,18,Candace,"Waiting for things to get dangerous, so I can my mom to come bust the boys."
4,18,Holly,That's not dangerous?
4,18,Candace,"Dude, this is nothing, it'll get worse."
4,18,Phineas,"So, did you get what you wished for?"
4,18,Isabella,Uh-
4,18,Buford,"Yeah, it's every girls wish to have her backyard covered in litter. Let's go you two. Next event."
4,18,Phineas,You're gonna love this.
4,18,Stacy,Is this where you go everyday Perry?
4,18,Doofenshmirtz,"(While fighting Perry) Oh yeah, pretty much. I create -inators, and he breaks in and thwarts my scheme, and it's, it's kinda our thing. (Perry knocks Doofenshmirtz to the ground) Ooh! The Grievance! I saw this in theaters. I still have nightmares about the greasy little girl who comes out of the base--"
4,18,Stacy,(Still behind the couch) No! Don't tell me how it ends!
4,18,Phineas,"And, now, what's a birthday party without a piñata the size of your house? Ferb? Hit it. (Ferb breaks the giant piñata with a giant bat, releasing smaller ones for everyone else to hit.)"
4,18,Adyson,Woohoo!
4,18,Ginger,I'm gonna bat with this stick.
4,18,Gretchen,"Give up the candy, yo!"
4,18,Holly,(Still speaking with Candace) This isn't dangerous enough?
4,18,Candace,We're getting there.
4,18,Baljeet,"Isabella, this must be your best birthday ever."
4,18,Isabella,"(A little sadly) Yeah, sure. It's super cool. I didn't need--"
4,18,Buford,"Okay Birthday girl, onto the next. (He trows a bag over her, and deposits her at her pool)"
4,18,Phineas,"Gather 'round everyone, and keep your eyes on the pool. Isabella, it's grand finale time! (He pulls a lever, and the pool begins to shake.)"
4,18,Holly,Um? This might be the time to call.
4,18,Candace,Yep! (She dials Linda) Mom? You've got to come across the street immediately.
4,18,Kids,Ooh!
4,18,Milly,"What a grand, and glorious, and potentially bustable gift!"
4,18,Adyson,I've never seen anything like it!
4,18,Linda,That key? That key?
4,18,Candace,Mom! Mom!
4,18,Linda,"Here, grab these will ya?"
4,18,Candace,"Mom, you've got to see what the boys are doing in Isabella's yard!"
4,18,Linda,Isabella's yard? That's a new one.
4,18,Stacy,"Alright, look. You're getting oil all over the place. Someone's going to have to-- (Stacy trips, and falls in the pool of oil.)"
4,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No! It's the greasy Grievance girl from the basement! No! No! What have I done? Why do you have a grievance against me? (Doofenshmirtz screams, and jumps out the window)"
4,18,Stacy,"(Fixing her hair) Whoa. What was that all about? Do the Flynn Fletchers know you fight evil scientists? (Stacy accidentally steps on the remote firing the -inator, and Perry whacks it with a bat, destroying it. The -inator beam bounces off a satellite and heads back towards Earth)"
4,18,Candace,"Back here, Mom."
4,18,Isabella,"Butterflies? I love butterflies! Oh, thank you Phineas!"
4,18,Phineas,(Confused at how the gift turned to butterflies) What?
4,18,Candace,"But, but, but, but, but... Butterflies?!"
4,18,Linda,"Oh, how beautiful. How long did it take you guys to collect them all?"
4,18,Major Monogram,"Let's go boys, looks like we've got some cleaning up to do. Alright you and you begin with the pavement area around here. And you... (Monogram rings the doorbell) Danville Water and Power. We're here to read your gas thingy."
4,18,Stacy,"Perry? What is all this? (Perry hands Stacy a pamphlet) A-a host family, mind erasing, balloon coverup? I mean is all this really necessary? (Perry shrugs) Wait a minute! It says right here in your silly little pamphlet that if your host family finds out about your agent status, then anyone who's seen you has to have their memory erased, or you'll get relocated. Perry, I'm not part of your host family!  I know, I know, it's a technicality. Look, I don't want Candace and the boys to lose you, but I also do not want my mind erased. I'm on the last ten minutes of that Grievance movie, and I don't want to have to watch that whole scary mess again. So, uh, can we just keep this a secret? (Perry smiles and tips his hat to Stacy)"
4,18,Carl,"Luckily Sir, it looks like the residents were not home."
4,18,Stacy,"(At the front door) Hello? Uh, anybody there?"
4,18,Major Monogram,"(To Carl) I'll take care of it. (To Stacy) Oh, hello there young teenager. You live here?"
4,18,Stacy,Yes. I walked home from the mall to find... this. What is happening here?
4,18,Major Monogram,"Oh, you didn't see what happened? Well, um. We're with the city, and there was a swamp gas incident here. We'll just get it all cleaned up, and get out of your hair. (He turns to Carl) Psst. Hey Carl. We're not going to need the mind erasing device. (He looks back at Stacy) I mean monkey wrench. Hehe. Monkey wrench, we don't need that."
4,18,Katie,"Happy birthday, Isabella!"
4,18,Isabella,Thanks guys!
4,18,Phineas,"I still can't figure out what went wrong with the grand finale. After the laser light show, and the fireballs, the swans should have been released, and-"
4,18,Isabella,"Phineas, I really liked the butterflies. Thank you."
4,18,Phineas,"Well to make it up to you, it's kinda lame but... maybe Ferb and I could, I don't know, take you out for some ice cream or something?"
4,18,Isabella,Uh-
4,18,Ferb,I...just remembered there's...something I need to do. You two go.
4,18,Phineas,Is that cool?
4,18,Isabella,Yes! Very cool. Ferb.
4,18,Phineas,"So, did you get what you wished for? Oh, yeah, I already asked that. Confetti, and streamers. Hold on, gonna get another napkin. (He goes off)"
4,18,Isabella,"(romantically) And butterflies, you always give me butterflies."
4,18,Candace,"(From her window) Ah, look at them out there. What are they up to? Ah, it looks like Phineas is saying ""Where's Perry?"" Huh. Where do you think Perry goes everyday Stace?"
4,18,Stacy,(Quickly and nervously) How should I know!? Why are you asking me!? How should I know!? Don't look at me!
4,18,Candace,"(She stares at Stacy for a moment) Nah, I don't know why I was asking you."
4,18,Stacy,"(In her head) Whew, no one suspects a thing."
4,3,Candace,(On the phone) You'll never guess what I'm doing tonight.
4,3,Stacy,"Well, you might be..."
4,3,Candace,"Going on a big date, but guess with whom?"
4,3,Stacy,Obviously—
4,3,Candace,It's Jeremy. (Squeals) But you'll never guess where.
4,3,Stacy,(Sighs) I have no idea.
4,3,Candace,Neither do I. He says it's a surprise.
4,3,Stacy,"Oh, lucky you."
4,3,Candace,"The problem is if I don't know where we're going, I don't know what to wear."
4,3,Stacy,"Oh! I know, Hair bows. They're all the rage this days. Just don't wear any feather-earrings, they're so last Tuesday."
4,3,Candace,"(Puts feather-earrings down) Ah! Yeah, so last Tuesday, Ah hah. I-I would never wear something so Tuesdayish of last."
4,3,Phineas,"Well, seems the parts didn't arrive for our Zombie-robot pool table. Anybody have any other suggestions?"
4,3,Buford,"Hey, remember how we did that super Rollercoaster? How 'bout a super duper Rollercoaster?"
4,3,Baljeet,"So, you are just adding a ""duper"" then?"
4,3,Buford,It's an acceptable suffix.
4,3,Isabella,We did a Portal to Mars. Maybe...a Portal to Venus?
4,3,Baljeet,Hah! Only if they make SPF 12 million.
4,3,Buford,"Okay-okay! How 'bout a super-super duper-duper-duper Rollercoaster? What, too much or not enough?"
4,3,Phineas,"Actually, instead of improving one of our old inventions, we should make something brand new! Something simple."
4,3,Isabella,How do you mean?
4,3,Phineas,"Well, what is summer all about?"
4,3,(Song,"""Summer (Where Do We Begin?)"")"
4,3,"Buford, Isabella, Baljeet","♪ Summer is running through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes, and-- ♪"
4,3,Phineas,"Yeah, we all know the song. (beat) But I'm not exactly sure how...."
4,3,Buford,"Well, Hurry up and think of somethin', I'm gettin' tired hanging around here."
4,3,Phineas,"That's it Buford. You can't get more summer than a tire swing. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
4,3,Buford,"Uh, hatch mosquitoes?"
4,3,Phineas,No. Hey! Where's Perry?
4,3,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P, We have a report that Doofenshmirtz is at the Shark. We don't know which Shark, but it sounds bad. Ugh! Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it..."
4,3,Carl,"Sir, it was a typo, Doof isn't at the Shark, he's at the park."
4,3,Major Monogram,"Well then, that's a lot lower on my heebie-jeebie scale. So Agent P, uh, change of plan. Head over to the park and stop Doof from doing the doings that Doof does ...do (Clears throat)"
4,3,Carl,"You have a heebie-jeebie scale, sir?"
4,3,Major Monogram,Yeah. You're on it.
4,3,Phineas,An old-fashioned tire-swing but huge and powered by jet-engines that can flatten a small village. Baljeet have you calibrated the ailerons yet?
4,3,Baljeet,"Oh sure, calibrated the ailerons..."
4,3,Buford,I'll just stay here and fiddle with stuff so I look busy.
4,3,Phineas,"Hey, Buford."
4,3,Buford,"What? I didn't take nothing out of nowhere. But, uhm, just as a hypothetical. Uh... What do you think would happen if say you took that goofy doohickey-thing out of the thingamawhatsit?"
4,3,Phineas,"Hmm... Good question. Ferb? (Opens a blueprint.) Well, if we account for the coolness of the jet propulsion circuits this early in the day and the increased internal humidity while that access port is open, removing the part in question would cause the machine to emit a ray that turns a human into a fly."
4,3,Buford,Really?
4,3,Phineas,"You'd be surprised how often removing a single component can make the difference between one thing and a highly complicated totally unrelated other thing. For instance, if you remove this part it will become a Sorbet machine. Why do you ask?"
4,3,Buford,"Oh, no reason."
4,3,Candace,"A hair bow? Only Stacy can pull this off. (Screams) I'm a fly, how is this possible? Phineas and Ferb, you are so buzzzzzzzzted! Mom!"
4,3,Candace,"Bzzzz! Bzzzzzzz!!! Bzz bzzz bzzzzzz! Bzzzzzz! (close up on fly Candace as she buzzes in her mother's ear) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb invented somethin' that turns people into flies!"
4,3,Candace,Bzzzz bzzzzzz!
4,3,Linda,"Ew, get away, fly! Shoo! Oops! I'm late for my appointment."
4,3,Candace,"Bzzzzz! Bzzzzz! Mom! It's me! Mom!!! You need to bust the boys and get them to turn me back into me before Jeremy gets back here! (wide shot as Candace realizes she's in the car with Linda, who starts the ignition) What?! (She flies in place but not before smashing into the window) Help meeeeee!"
4,3,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you join me for a picnic? (Perry hesitates but then walks up, but not before sinking into his trap. Doofenshmirtz laughs.) Ah! Ah! Ow, my duodenum. Oh, oh, did you see your face?! You were like, ""Ooh, maybe I shouldn't,"" but you're then, ""Well, I am hungry"" and then BOOM! down you went! Ha-ha! And are you hungry, Perry the Platypus? (Picks up the picnic basket) Well, too bad, it's not for you. It's for them. (Whip pan to reveal pigeons eating seeds. Cut back to Doofenshmirtz, who retrieves an inator from the basket) Behold! My feed-the-pigeons-inator! (Perry just gives Doofenshmirtz a look) Okay, Snobby the Snobapus, I know it doesn't sound like much, but it is technically evil. I am breaking the law. See? (whip pan to a sign saying, ""DO NOT FEED THE PIGEONS!"") There? There. ""Do not feed the pigeons"". And I am going to feed the pigeons, therefore I am breaking the law. ""Do not feed the pigeons"". It's a-it's a metal sign with......big red letters on it and that makes it.......legally binding. (covers his eyes) Okay, here's the truth: I got evil scientist's block, alright? (sighs) Seriously, I got—I got nothing. I—I was going to make a good-idea-inator, but I thought it would be counterproductive because it already had ""good"" in the title. So then I invented a bad-idea-inator, which...just...gave me this. And see where that got me. Ah, I'm telling ya, I'm dry, Perry the Platypus. Dry! And the summer just keeps going on and on and it feels like it's been goin' on for, like, four years! I'm asking ya man to monotreme, can you help me? (Perry comes out of his hole and leads Doofenshmirtz) See? Even my trap design has become...lackluster."
4,3,Phineas,"Lady and gentlemen, may we present the good old-fashioned new-fashioned tire swing! (Cut to inside the tire swing to reveal Phineas, Isabella, Ferb, Baljeet and Buford inside the tire) Prepare to engage thrusters! (The tire begins swinging back and forth with rocket launchers) The fully-pressurized cabin is gyroscopically balanced for a perfectly smooth ride."
4,3,Baljeet,Hmmm. Now it just feels like we are watching a movie.
4,3,Phineas,"(pushing a red button) True, but we can also go old school! Hang on, everybody!"
4,3,Isabella,This is great!
4,3,Buford,I have never been so sick to my stomach!!
4,3,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I think I've gleaned from your expression that you are now going to lead me through a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated exercises that will help me get my groove back. Does that about sum it up? Good. Let's do this thing!"
4,3,Candace,Bzzzz! Bzzzzzz! Bzzz bzz bzzzzz!
4,3,Linda,"You again? Ha ha! Looks like I took you on a little trip. (opens her window) Get back to your family, little fella."
4,3,Candace,Little fella? What of me looks like a little FELLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! (she tumbles out the window)
4,3,(Song,"""Fly On the Wall"")"
4,3,Candace,(gasp) This is Jeremy's house! And there's Jeremy! At last! A silver lining! I can find out where we're goin' tonight! A girl's gotta know what a girl's gotta wear.
4,3,Jeremy,"Yeah, it's a total surprise. I'm taking her to the rodeo."
4,3,Candace,"The rodeo? I love rodeos! Wait, do I love rodeos or is that because I'm a fly?"
4,3,Jeremy,"Oh, hang on, Coltrane, there's a fly in here. Lemme get it."
4,3,Gretchen,There's one!
4,3,Holly,"C'mon, Fireside Girls!"
4,3,Ginger,Let's get it!
4,3,Holly,"Well, girls, there goes our lizard-feeding patch."
4,3,Candace,Zzzzzz...zzzzzz! (she lands on a water spout. Close up as she catches her breath) Could this day get any weirder?
4,3,Male Voice,Hello.
4,3,Candace,"Omigosh, were you turned into a fly, too?"
4,3,Human Fly,Who me? No. I was always a fly. I just got shot with a human-head-inator and...now I got this thing! It's really uncomfortable. How do you walk around with these?
4,3,Candace,Tell me about it. Be glad you don't have a freakishly long neck! (She buzzes out of frame)
4,3,Isabella,That was the most fun ever!
4,3,Phineas,Yeah! And let's restock the snack bar and go again!
4,3,Baljeet,Now there is something you do not see every day: a fly with orange hair.
4,3,Phineas,Orange hair? (takes out a loupe) Uh oh! (POV shot from the loupe to show a really ticked-off Candace fly) Candace has been turned into a fly! (cut back to Phineas) Wait a minute! Did someone take the doohickey out of the thingamawhatsit? (looks aside) Buford?
4,3,Buford,"Uhhh...oh no! If I catch the mug what did this...Yeah I'm on it! (he walks to the control panel) Okay, I just pull on... (he activates something and a yellow ray shoots out)"
4,3,Buford,(offscreen) Whoop! Wrong one!
4,3,Buford,(offscreen) Not that one!
4,3,Phineas,Wa-wait! Go back two!
4,3,Candace,"(gasps, happily) Oh thank you thank you thank you thank you! (exits then enters again, angrily) I mean, you are so busted! (exits again, then enters again, happily) But thank you!"
4,3,Buford,"Took a few tries there! If I weren't thinking, I woulda just pressed this ""fly"" button. (He presses the fly button, causing the giant tire swing to launch, taking the pedestal with it) Oh, that kind of fly!"
4,3,Astronaut,"Woah, that is so weird! We're in a space shuttle and the shuttle program ended years ago!"
4,3,Isabella,I guess that's it. Fun's over.
4,3,Phineas,Au contraire. (He pushes a button and the control panel changes into a sorbet machine. He passes out a couple of sorbets to his friends) Sorbet?
4,3,Doofenshmirtz,"This is great! The best inator I've ever made! And you know what, Perry the Platypus? There's no self-destruct button on this, so there's no way you can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-State— (The giant tire swing lands on his inator before he finishes his statement) Huh. Well, like my Uncle Boris used to say, ""When life's goin' well, a giant tire comes along and smashes your inator."" We all thought he was crazy at the time, but now it seems rather prophetic."
4,3,Buford,"I don't get why this stuff is called ""sorbet""? Ain't it just a fancy people word for ""ice cream""?"
4,3,Ferb,"While ice cream is made from dairy products and turned vigorously with air, sorbet is made entirely out of fancy people."
4,3,Buford,Really?
4,3,Ferb,"No, not really."
4,3,Jeremy,"Hey, guys! (He comes in dressed in his fancy suit) Is Candace around?"
4,3,Candace,"(offscreen) Hey there, Jeremy! (cut to the sliding door to reveal Candace in a cowgirl outfit, speaking in a western accent) A lil' birdie told me we were goin' to the rodeo!"
4,3,Maitre d',"(French accent) Actually, sir, it is pronounced ""ro-day-o""."
4,3,Jeremy,"Oh, yeah. My mistake."
4,3,Maitre d',"(to Candace) May I take your order...""partner""?"
4,3,Candace,(sighs) I don't suppose it's Dress Like a Cowboy and Get Your Dinner Free Night.
4,3,Maitre d',"No, madame. That is Tuesdays."

4,2,Vivian,Have fun at the party!
4,2,Linda,"(in her car) Thanks for having the boys over tonight, Vivian."
4,2,Vivian,"Oh, no problem, Linda. I have all the neighborhood kids tonight."
4,2,Candace,"(in the back seat of the car) C'mon, c'mon, I don't want to be late for my first grown-up party!"
4,2,Linda,"Heh. Okay, hun. Bye everyone! Happy New Year!"
4,2,Phineas,Bye guys!
4,2,"Isabella, Buford, Baljeet, Vivian",Goodbye!
4,2,"Phineas, Isabella, Buford, Baljeet, Vivian",Happy New Year!
4,2,Isabella,"We're gonna have so much fun! We've got noisemakers, balloons, confetti..."
4,2,Vivian,"And of course, we'll all stay up till midnight and watch the New Year's Eve ball drop!"
4,2,Buford,"Baljeet's already out! (elbowing Baljeet, who is asleep standing up) Wake up, will ya! You're drooling all over my arm!"
4,2,Baljeet,"You know, saliva is 98% water and the other 2% is made up of very beneficial electrolytes. It is gross, but it is science."
4,2,Buford,"You're lucky the gross factor outweighs the science factor, or you'd have a one-way ticket to wedgie town!"
4,2,Phineas,"Well, it'll be fun to finally see the ball drop."
4,2,Vivian,"Oh, it's a wonderful tradition!"
4,2,Isabella,"And, of course, there's the other tradition of kissing someone special at midnight."
4,2,Phineas,"Well then, I know what we're going to do tonight."
4,2,Isabella,Really?
4,2,Phineas,Yeah! We're gonna make our own New Year's ball and drop it from outer space!
4,2,Vivian,"Your mother is right, Phineas. You have such an active imagination!"
4,2,Isabella,(dryly) Not active enough.
4,2,Vivian,"I'm going to make some hot chocolate. You kids come in when you want to warm up. Hey, where's your platypus?"
4,2,Major Monogram,"(wearing a winter knit cap) Morning, Agent P. Sorry about the cold climate inside your lair; see, the heating system is on the fritz and we had to call a guy in from Aruba, but I can assure you that we are all in the same boat here. (Perry is now completely frozen in ice, except for his bill) You're not alone in this; we are all sharing the pain, and... (a beach ball hits the background, which drops, revealing that Monogram is in Aruba) Heh heh heh, awk-ward."
4,2,Carl,Race ya to the wet ski!
4,2,Major Monogram,"Um, uh, Doof's doing something in City Hall, uh, put a stop to whatever it is. (running after Carl) Hey Carl, I get the blue one!"
4,2,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
4,2,Isabella,"Okay, Phineas, we're good to go!"
4,2,Phineas,Great. Bring her down! How's the soldering going up there?
4,2,Baljeet,Ferb is almost done.
4,2,Phineas,"How are you doing, Buford?"
4,2,Buford,Why do I have to paint? Painting is for babies and beatniks!
4,2,Phineas,"That's no ordinary paint. It's a super-sealer that will protect us from the cold, dark vacuum of space!"
4,2,Buford,Beatnik talk!
4,2,Irving,"(followed by the Fireside Girls and two other kids, all staring in awe at the ball) Hey, Phineas. Mind if we see the inside?"
4,2,Phineas,Not at all! (They enter; each room is shown as Phineas mentions it) Check it out! A multi-level New Year's ball with punch bowl sailing...
4,2,Isabella,Ahoy!
4,2,Phineas,"...balloon room, the bed of a thousand coats, an infinity slide, and through here, the grand ballroom! In other words, a ball within a ball!"
4,2,Irving,Whoa!
4,2,Phineas,Irving?
4,2,Irving,(on the infinity slide) How do I get out of here?!
4,2,Norm,Happy New Year!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm, I told you: You don't celebrate 'til midnight, not all day. What if midnight never comes? Then you've squandered a whole day celebrating. Think of that, tough guy? (crashing sound is heard) Perry the Platypus? (the floor opens up below Perry, trapping him in the top of a bottle) Ha-ha! It's a bottle of sparkling cider trap, and you're the cork! Which makes you Perry the Cork-apus! Ha-ha, you got a funny name. Anyway, it's New Year's-themed!"
4,2,Norm,Happy New Year!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Not yet, Norm. And on to my plan: I recently learned that in most of the world, there's a tradition where people decide to change something about their lives in the coming year, and they call it ""a New Year's resolution."" I-I-I had no idea; you see, back in Drusselstein, change was frowned upon. Any change!"
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(voice over) Uh, you couldn't change your channel on your TV,..."
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(voice over) ...you couldn't change your underwear,..."
4,2,(Flashback of young Doofenshmirtz in jail with two tough-looking criminals)Doofenshmirtz,(voice over)...and forget about changing your hairstyle; you... you'd end up in jail.
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"But here in the new world, we embrace change! (beat) Apparently. And that's why I came up with the Resolution Changer-inator! Cleverly disguised as a bow tie! When I turn it on at the stroke of midnight, it will make everyone change their resolution from whatever it was, like, I don't know, ""I-I'm gonna lose weight,"" or, ""gain a limb,"" or whatever, to, ""I'm going to make Heinz Doofenshmirtz my leader and obey his every command."" That will be their new resolution. (puts the Resolution Changer-inator on) All right, Norm, how do I look?"
4,2,Norm,Like a pharmacist in a bow tie!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Eh, good enough. Time to go. (Norm blows a noisemaker) You're squandering, Norm!"
4,2,Lawrence,"(entering the party at City Hall with Linda) Ready to get your party on, dear?"
4,2,Linda,Do one-legged ducks swim in circles?
4,2,Candace,"(entering the party with Stacy) Wow, first year with the adults!"
4,2,Stacy,"Yep, we're all grown up now. No more pigtails, dollies, or obsessing over boys."
4,2,Candace,"From now on, we obsess over men. (Candace and Stacy laugh) And no more busting!"
4,2,Stacy,Attagirl.
4,2,Candace,"Yep, I'm sticking to my resolution and turning over a new leaf. Fifteen whole minutes and I haven't thought of Phineas and Ferb. (her eye starts twitching) How they make those things. You know, those big, like, dangerous things they make..."
4,2,Stacy,Candace...
4,2,Candace,"Sorry! I'm back, I'm back. Resolution... kicking in. Oh look, here come the boys!"
4,2,Stacy,You mean men? (Candace and Stacy laugh)
4,2,Jeremy,(walking up to them with Coltrane) Ladies.
4,2,Stacy,That's us! We're ladies.
4,2,Norm,Carbonation is fun!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(entering the party) Hello, Danville! (running up to a man) Hey you there, what's your New Year's resolution?"
4,2,Mustached man,To update my mustache.
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,That's what you think! (walking away) Ha-HA-ha-ha! HA-ha!
4,2,Mustached man,I don't know; it seemed achievable.
4,2,Candace,"(sitting at a table with Stacy) This is so great, being here as an adult. (giggles) Heh-heh. Not like my brothers. Who are kids. Who are probably building something, and it's something big..."
4,2,Stacy,Candace...
4,2,Candace,Big and bustable... Gotta go!
4,2,Stacy,Oh no you don't! This is gonna be a new year with a new Candace! Remember?
4,2,Candace,"(trying to resist, gripping the table) Gotta bust. G-g-g-gotta-g-g-gotta bu-bu-bu-bust! (breaks off two chunks of the table) Bust!"
4,2,Stacy,(as Candace keeps chattering) It's okay. It's just a temporary relapse.
4,2,Jeremy,"(walking up with Coltrane, holding a tray with four glasses of sparkling cider on it) Candace? Stacy told me about your New Year's resolution."
4,2,Candace,Iiiiii... I need a timeout. I'll be right back!
4,2,Jeremy,Relapse?
4,2,Stacy,Relapse.
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(to a woman) That's what you think! Ha-HA-ha-ha-ha! Oh, it never stops being... (gasps as Perry enters)"
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? You can't come in here; this is a black-tie affair. (Perry closes the door, then reenters wearing a half of a tux)"
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Actually, I guess it doesn't really specify pants anywhere, so I guess you're okay."
4,2,Lawrence,"(to Linda) Oh, and another little tidbit about the ancient Egyptians (Doofenshmirtz and Perry run past them in the background) is that both men and women wore makeup."
4,2,Linda,Just like the '80s.
4,2,Candace,"(in the ladies bathroom, washing her face with cold water) Hbrbrbrbrbr... Hold it together, girl. You can do this."
4,2,Sandwich woman's friend,"Hey, I thought your New Year's resolution was to stop eating sandwiches in the bathroom."
4,2,Sandwich woman,"(eating a large sandwich) But it's not midnight yet, so I can still enjoy this."
4,2,Candace,"Not midnight yet? That's it! I've actually got an hour left to bust my brothers! (running out of City Hall) I've gotta find out what they're doing! I'll get video. Whoa! Ooh! (slips and falls on a patch of ice) Aah! Aah!! (skids down an alleyway, bounces off a pillow and goes flying) Aah!!! (swings around a street lamp's pole and lands on her feet) Ooh! Huh, that parkour training actually paid off."
4,2,Phineas,"All right, let's start this bash in a ball! (pulls a lever)"
4,2,Kids,Yay! (they all throw confetti)
4,2,Candace,"(gasping) Huh, huh... (sees the ball rise) No, I missed it! And how am I gonna show Mom?"
4,2,Irving,(standing next to a camera set-up) No worries! I'm live-blogging the whole event on my podcast! We're trending right now!
4,2,Candace,"Right now? (into the camera) Hey, all of you out there in Internet Land! Watch closely, because I'm gonna bust Phineas and Ferb. (leaves)"
4,2,Irving,(into the camera) Hee hee hee! She never busts them. (into the camera again) And Internet Land is not a real place!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(runs through a curtain into a room filled with coats) What is this, the coat room? (Perry launches himself from behind the coats into Doofenshmirtz, who goes flying into a rack of coats; he emerges with a pink hat and coat on) All right, Perry the Platypus, if you really want to fight, here I a... (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz into another coat rack) Ooh, Cashmere. Nice."
4,2,Candace,"(re-enters City Hall, gasping)"
4,2,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. I got you a glass of sparkling cider."
4,2,Candace,Raincheck! This is my last time to bust!
4,2,Jeremy,Serious relapse.
4,2,Candace,"Come on, Irving. (plugs her phone into the wall, switching the video feed to show Phineas and Ferb's ball) Yes! Everyone, can I have your attention please? (everyone turns to face Candace) My brothers and their friends will be dropping from outer space in that giant New Year's ball."
4,2,Crowd,Wow!
4,2,Man,Amazing!
4,2,Woman,"Ooh, that's fantastic!"
4,2,Candace,"No, that's not fantastic! It, uh, okay, well, I-I admit it's impressive, but it's still bustable! Mooo-oommmm!!"
4,2,Woman with pearls,"If those were my boys, they'd be so busted."
4,2,Candace,Please! Adopt me now! AAAUUUGGGHHH! Mom!
4,2,Phineas,"Okay, it's almost midnight, let's go! (pushes lever and the ball drops)"
4,2,Kids,(scream)
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(emerging from the coat room) Ha-HA! You'll never get out of that straitjacket. Why would anyone wear that to a New Year's Eve party? I guess maybe if you were a magician, maybe..."
4,2,Man and woman,(running out of coat room) Only one minute 'til midnight!
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,Time to launch my pla-an! (runs on stage) Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
4,2,Crowd,10! 9! 8!
4,2,Candace,Mom? Mom?
4,2,Crowd,7! 6! 5!
4,2,Sandwich woman,(still eating the sandwich) Almost done!
4,2,Crowd,4!
4,2,Candace,(sees Linda and Lawrence about to kiss in the courtyard) Mom! It's New Year's! This is no time for kissing!
4,2,Crowd,3! (Phineas and Ferb's ball lands) 2! 1!
4,2,Crowd,Happy New Year!! (cheers)
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,(to Perry) Now watch this. (to crowd) What is everyone's New Year's resolution?
4,2,Crowd,"To follow you, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, our new leader!"
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha-HA-ha-ha-ha! Mmmm, so, how does it feel to be a loser, Perry the Platypus? I mean, that's a rhetorical question. 'Course, if anyone should know how it feels, it should be me, but... (to crowd) All right, everyone! Follow me; we're taking over City Hall! (runs out of room; no one follows him, so he comes back in to find the crowd cheering) Hello? What are you doing? Obey me! Hey, wha-what about your resolution?"
4,2,Man with party hat,(laughing) Everyone knows that no one ever keeps their New Year's resolution.
4,2,Doofenshmirtz,"That doesn't even make any sense! Why would you make resolutions if you're not ever gonna fol... (to Perry) Did you know about this? You did! You knew about this and you still punched and kicked and pinched me. (Perry shrugs his shoulders) Ah, I guess you're right. That's... that is what we do. (Perry blows a noisemaker) Aw, thank you, Perry the Platypus. (Doofenshmirtz blows the noisemaker) Happy New Year."

4,2,Phineas,"Is this your doing, bro?"
4,2,Ferb,"""Auld Lang Syne"" literally means ""old long ago,"" but I'd rather think of New Year's as an unspoiled universe. (ball explodes into fireworks)"
4,2,Phineas,I sure hope Candace can see the fireworks.
4,2,Candace,"(standing with Jeremy on a balcony, watching the fireworks) You know, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep this resolution."
4,2,Jeremy,"That's okay. I like you just the way you are. Happy New Year, Candace."

4,19,Linda,(through the walkie-takie) I understand. You can't do anything if your wicks are wet.
4,19,Phineas,"Hi, Mom! How's the setup coming for the big block party?"
4,19,Linda,I'm totally overwhelmed and now I have no fireworks for the big finale.
4,19,Phineas,Anything we can do to help?
4,19,Linda,Oh that's sweet boys.
4,19,Man,"(Through the walkie-talkie) Madam Chairwoman, we have a code blue at the beignet bus."
4,19,Linda,"Yes, OK. I got it. (to the boys) I'm at my wit's end and I've got no finale."
4,19,Phineas,What about a laser light show?
4,19,Linda,"That's a great idea! (she hands a stack of papers to Ferb) Here's a budget and a list of companies that do light shows. Uh, can you just handle it for me? I've gotta run. (she runs off) Thanks so much!"
4,19,Phineas,"(at Ferb) You know, I think it might be easier to do the light show ourselves. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today-I mean tonight."
4,19,Lawrence,"(he rolls his tongue) Hello, hello hello! Can you guess what my DJ costume is for tonight's big Mardi Gras block party?"
4,19,Phineas,Uh... scary post-apocolyptic handpuppet?
4,19,Lawrence,"Why does everyone guess that? No, I'm a Mardi Gras jester. Speaking of which, where's Perry?"
4,19,Major Monogram,"Hello there Agent P. Your assignment concerns tonight's big block party. We've intercepted intel that Doof is planning on attendin' tonight's festivities ""just for the fun of it"". We need you to attend the block party and confirm that he's not up to no good. (pause) I realize that's a double negative but I think it still works. Not up to no good... yeah, i-it works. Unfortunately since your surveillance will take place in close proximity to your hosts, you will need to be in disguise for the duration of your mission. Carl, activate the hydraulic costume chamber."
4,19,Major Monogram,"Oh Agent P, you look adorable as a balloon animal. Now, get out there and laissez le bon temps rouler. (""Let the good times roll."")"
4,19,Candace,"This dumb block party totally is throwing off my entire day. Jeremy's stuck working the Slushy Dawg concession, my parents are busy with preparation, and the boys are so preoccupied with the party they haven't done anything remotely bustable all day."
4,19,Stacy,"(looks out the window and sees the boys in the backyard) Umm, I'm probably gonna regret this, but wouldn't a giant robot insect count?"
4,19,Candace,Woohoo! I'm back in the game.
4,19,Stacy,(flatly) What horrors did I just unleash?
4,19,Candace,"Phineas, Ferb, what is the giant insect robot thingy?"
4,19,Phineas,"It's not a giant insect robot thingy, it's—"
4,19,Phineas,It's part of the light show extravaganza for the block party's big finale.
4,19,Candace,Huge. Impossible. Bustable. MOM! (she runs off to find Linda)
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Ok Norm, you ready to head out to the block party?"
4,19,Norm,I'm not going.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,Don't tell me you're still bummed out about not having a date.
4,19,Norm,"Yes, yes I am."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,Quit your whining. Just go stag like me.
4,19,Norm,You mean dress up like a wild forest creature with antlers?
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,Ah... not quite. I tried that and it did not go well.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,H-hello? I think I may have come to the wrong address.
4,19,Doofenshimrtz,Come on Norm. You might meet a nice popcorn machine or a blender or something.
4,19,Norm,You had me at popcorn machine.
4,19,Candace,Mom Mom Mom Mom!!! Do you know what Phineas and Ferb are doing?!!!
4,19,Candace and Linda,They're working on the big finale for the block party tonight!
4,19,Candace,"Wait, what'd you say?"
4,19,Linda,I asked the boys to help out with the finale for the party.
4,19,Candace,On purpose?
4,19,Linda,"Yes, Candace, on purpose. I really need the help."
4,19,Candace,"But, but, but, but, but..."
4,19,Linda,Now leave them alone so they can get the job done.

4,19,Buford,Why not just use fireworks? Isn't that traditional for a finale?
4,19,Phineas,"It may be tradition, but the P.H.L.A.S.E.R is way cooler without the danger of loosing a didget."
4,19,Buford,"Quit it, Ferb! You're creeping me out man."
4,19,Phineas,"As soon as we polish off the lenses, we're good to go. Come on guys, let's grab some towels."
4,19,Candace,Situation: unbustable.

4,19,Norm,You've got a pretty hot oil pan.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh yeah, you got game now. (a man with a cotton candy machine stops next to the popcorn machine) Now, see someone else is making a move. You snooze, you lose, Norm."

4,19,Norm,My inner circuitry seems to be overloading.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Aww man. I left the electrical tape in my other labcoat. (He notices what Norm is looking at) Oh now I get it. Y-y-you've got a thing for that girl robot. Ah, she's not bad. I think you got a chance with her if you play your cards right."
4,19,Norm,What do I say? I do not believe she has an oil pan to complement.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Just introduce yourself and, you know, ask her what her sign is. And then run the other way if she says Sagittarius."
4,19,Norm,"Thank you, sir!"
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Go get her, Norm."
4,19,Norm,"Hi, I'm Norm. What is your sign?"
4,19,Female Robot,"Hi, I am Chloe. I am a Pisces."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,Well?
4,19,Norm,You did not tell me what to do if she is a Pisces.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"In my experience you get married, and then subsequently divorced but we don't have time for that. We gotta get you rolling."
4,19,Balthazar,Excuse me can I- (Perry shushes him and gives him a balloon fedora) Thanks!
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,So are we clear Norm?
4,19,Norm,"Talk about her interests, and try to find something in common."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Right, but don't be too obvious. Women like it when you challenge them, and act all superior."
4,19,Norm,That does not seem logical.
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"We are talking about women here, right? Okay, now remember, don't forget to stay cool."
4,19,Norm,"No problem, my compressor is from a refrigeration unit."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,What are you telling me for? I'm the guy who installed it.
4,19,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. just checking in to see if you noticed any evil activity from Doofenshmirtz, (Perry looks up to Major Monogram is standing right there, with Carl holding up a backboard) there's a-- Monogram out. (He walks away)"
4,19,Norm,Hello Chloe.
4,19,Chloe,Hello Norm.
4,19,Norm,"So, what's your prime directive?"
4,19,Chloe,My core competency is dancing.
4,19,Norm,"What a coincidence! My core competency is being superior, and challenging those whose core competency is dancing."
4,19,Chloe,We shall see about that. I accept your challenge. See you an the dance floor.
4,19,Norm,"See you there. Right after I defrost, because I am so cool. (He walls over to Doofenshmirtz)"
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,Well?
4,19,Norm,"She wants to dance with me, but now I am nervous."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, go on now. You just got to get out of your own head."
4,19,Norm,How do I get out of my own head?
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Just get out there on the dance floor, and strut your stuff Normy-G."
4,19,Norm,Commencing stuff strutting.
4,19,Lawrence,"Alright, I want to see everyone out there on the dance floor. Parents, kids, giant robots, sure why not? Let's kick this party into second gear!"
4,19,Phineas,"(In the backyard) Oh, wow that's our cue, time to fire up the P.H.L.A.S.E.R. guys. Are the lenses all clean?"
4,19,Buford,"The lenses are good, but all the blood's rushed to my head."

4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, you were smooth-tastic. Are you going to introduce me to your new girl?"
4,19,Norm,"Why yes, of course. This is--"
4,19,Rodney,"Chloe, what are you doing?"
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Rodney. Wait, wait, this is your robot?"
4,19,Rodney,"Come Chloe. Let's get you away from this, rusted Romeo."
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh yeah? Well I, I'm too flustered to come up with an insult, so I'll call you later, and give it to you then. Come on Norm."
4,19,Norm,"Goodbye Chloe. ""Parting is such sweet sorrow."""
4,19,Chloe,"That is a reference from Romeo and Juliet, so I shall say ""goodnight 'til it be morrow."""
4,19,Doofenshmirtz,"See you don't need her Norm, she's a know it all. Ugh, ooh, look, corndogs!"
4,19,Linda,(She walks into the backyard) Boys are you here? I just wanted to say-- Phineas! Ferb! You are so busted!
4,19,Candace,What!? Get out of the way! Wait! Wait! Wait! Did I hear you just bust Phineas and Ferb?
4,19,Linda,I certainly did. (Candace giggles under) What are all my good guest towels doing out here? And they're filthy!
4,19,Candace,(Stops giggling) Towels?
4,19,Phineas,"Oh, sorry mom."
4,19,Candace,Towels!?
4,19,Phineas,We'll clean them up.
4,19,Linda,"Yeah, you get right on that. when you're done we'll have beignets."
4,19,Candace,"So let me get this straight, after everything they've done this summer, you decide to yell at them for a few dirty towels?"
4,19,Linda,Isn't that enough? (Walks away)
4,19,Candace,Way to make a mockery of my lifetime goal Mom. Towels.

4,25,Mr. Macabre,"Hello, children. Welcome to the Macabre Book Mobile. What is your pleasure tonight? How about a fright? Well, you are in luck, because I have three stories that are guaranteed to make you scream with delight. Mwa...Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! (a hand tickles him with a feather) Stop it! (takes the feather) Enough with the feather, Renfield. We talked about this. Now, knock it off and go stand over there by the Chifferobe. And stay off of those olives. I'm saving them. (zoom in) For company. Mwa...Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
4,25,Hipster Guy,"(offscreen) Uh, excuse me?"
4,25,Mr. Macabre,What?
4,25,Hipster Guy,Can I get a free-range organic grilled cheese slider?
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"This isn't a food truck, you baboon. It's a Macabre Book Mobile."
4,25,Hipster Guy,"(takes out phone and leaves) Yeah, I'm totally giving you a bad review."
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"(shakes fist) May the ancient moths of Sumeria feast upon your skinny jeans! (phone buzzes) One star? Man, that burns. Now where was I? Oh, yes. The first story in our (blood red title appears on screen) Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror... (notices the title on screen) Oh, for crying out loud! (Takes out a squeegee and wipes off the words, line by line.) Sorry about that. Now where were we?"
4,25,Mr. Macabre,Chapter one. A teenage girl chats idly (Crossfade to the Flynn-Fletcher house.) to her friend alone in her room as a storm rages outside. （A lightning flashes on background) Little does she know what evil awaits her as she discovers how dangerous careless words can be.
4,25,Candace,"(on phone) No, Stacy, I have the whole place to myself. Mom and Dad are at the movies, and the boys are playing ping pong over at Buford's. Oh, so listen to this weird book I've been readin'. ""If one repeats this incantation in the presence of a doll, then alive it shall be!"" Ha ha! But check this out: ""The light of a full moon will make it evil."" Oh, (picks up Ducky Momo doll) I'm so totally doing it! Oh, relax, Stacy, it's funny! Ukka-samma-hi, oona-mooda-salla. I will you alive, Ducky Momo! (in a demonic voice) ""Candace, this is Ducky Momo! You must buy more of my memorabilia, like my 50th anniversary collector's item bobblehead!"" (normal voice) But, y'know, I'm really concerned about its resale value. (puts the doll on her face) Aaah! Help! Help! Ha ha ha! Sorry, okay, just havin' a little fun! (leaves her windowsill and walks to her closet and while at her closet) So, what's up? Y'know I just use this new exfoliating and moisturizing scrub in the bath, which is totally confusing (Candace changes her clothes) because why exfoliate off all the cells you just moisturized?...Weird. (hears something move) Hold on, Stacy. I thought I heard a sound coming from under the bed. (reaches under her bed and a black cat screeches and scurries from under it) Cheese and crackers! Hey, we don't even have a cat. (reaches back under the bed and gets her Ducky Momo doll) How did you get under there? (picks back up the phone) Oh, it's nothing. Ducky Momo must've fallen under my bed. (to the doll) Now stay put. (lightning flash as the doll moves) Okay, so let me tell you about my day with Jeremy. So he picks me up and the same song I've been playing in my room was the same song he was playing in his car! (The doll crawls onto the bed behind her.) The same song! I mean, what are the chances of that? (Candace drops the towel onto the doll.) And then he says, ""You wanna get grilled cheeses at that place?"" And I was just thinkin' I wanted grilled cheese so he gets one!"
4,25,Candace,"Me? I'm just makin' a snack. Just thought I'd have, you know, somethin' healthy. What? Oh, okay, you caught me. Donuts and cheesy popcorn. (The Ducky Momo doll peers behind the door. The door handle jiggles. Cut to outside as the doll attempts to open the door. The doll reaches into its stuffing and takes out a credit card and slides it through the door. Cut to Candace getting a glass of water.) Ah, Jeremy was so great, he took us out for mani-pedis. (The door opens.) Is someone there? Oh, the storm just blew the door open. Yeah, I know. Creepy. (The Ducky Momo doll attempts to walk between Candace's legs. Candace closes the door with her leg, slamming it on the doll.) Anyway, since Jeremy's mom is a regular at the mani-pedi place, we got special treatment. Yeah, they served us sparkling apple juice and finger sandwiches and made fun of us in Thai. It was all so classy. What can I say? (closes the fridge door with her foot) I love a well-groomed foot."
4,25,(Song,"""No Mo Mo"")"
4,25,Candace,"Is someone there? (gasps and dials her phone) Stacy, I know you're gonna think this is crazy, but I honestly think something is in the room with me. Have you ever been in a situation where your whole body, like, senses a presence? Like, you can't see it, but it's, like...it's, like, right next to...you? (Zoom out to reveal the Ducky Momo doll on the arm of the couch. The doll quacks and stretches his arms out. Candace screams and runs off.) Upstairs! The only logical escape! (Candace runs upstairs but gets her ankle caught in a curtain. The doll approaches the stairs quacking. Candace screams and bites the curtain off. The doll climbs up the stairs. Candace frees herself from the curtain, hides behind a wall and dials her phone.) Stacy, you gotta help me! The spell from that weird book worked! Ducky Momo is alive and he's trying to get me!! No, he's downstairs. He—Would you stop laughing? Yes, you are! I can hear the milk shooting out of your nose! (She looks behind her and sees the doll and yells, dropping her phone.) My phone! (The phone lands by the doll's webbed feet. It ends the call.) Back! Stay back! Ah! (Takes down a picture) Stay away from me! (Takes down a poster and crumples it up.) You stay away! I'm serious! Uh! (She slides a table across the hall.) Oh, come on! (The doll sees the crumpled poster on the floor and walks around it.) No! He's unstoppable! (Cut to Candace pulling on her bedroom door handle.) Come on! Open! Open! Open! Oh, yeah. It's an innie. (Pushes the door open and pants.) Keep it together, Candace, think! Think think think! Block the door! Block the door! (She blocks the door with everything but the kitchen sink. She then pulls up the doll and screams and hides under her bed.) I didn't really mean to wish you to life! I was just goofing around! I don't understand! What do you want?! (The doll jumps on the bed, reaches out his arms and quacks.) Huh? It almost looks like you want a...a hug. (The doll jumps up and down excitedly.) Seriously? You just want a hug? Well, okay. (Hugs the doll.) But I don't get it. If the incantation made you alive, then the moonlight should've made you evil. (The doll shakes his head quacking and points out the window.) What? What? Oh, the moon was behind the clouds, so you're not evil. (The clouds uncover the full moon shining on Mr. Miggins, who comes to life and roars evilly.) But now Mr. Miggins is!! AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"Ah, you have returned for more. (Throws away the olive.) Our second story starts upon a dark and stormy night, where a platypus will soon show an evil scientist that every wish has a twist and the wisher might not wish for what he wished. Mwa..Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
4,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey. (Beat. He finally realizes who is behind him and stammers, almost dropping the book.) Doggone it! You...You should know better than to sneak up on a guy like that! Especially on a dark and stormy night! Anyway, I was reading this weird book, and there's a chapter in here I think might interest you. (Doofenshmirtz shows Perry a chapter. Perry looks at it, but not before Doofenshmirtz closes the book on him.) Ha! Sucker! Surprised you fell for that old ""slam the platypus in a book"" trick. (places Perry and the book in a shelf) Actually, I'm surprised it took me that long to think of it. Anywho, you should know that that mysterious book that you are trapped in has a very interesting chapter about...♪ Bum bum bum!! ♪...the inexplicable Giant Floating Baby Head! (Thunder and lightning) Wow! That was weird. Wonder if that's gonna happen every time I say, ""The inexplicable Giant Floating Baby Head."" (Thunder and lightning) Oh, cool! Hey, watch this! The inexplicable Giant Floating Baby HHHHam Sandwich. (thunder and lightning) Ah! Anyway, the chapter says that if you get close enough to touch the...uh, the inexplicable Giant Floating (whispers) you know... (normal voice) you get three wishes. Pretty sweet, huh? The rest of the chapter was devoted to the Giant Floating...Rest of the Baby, but since I've never seen one in Danville, I never finished. So how am I going to get the Baby Head to come to me? Behold! (walks up to the inator) The Inexplicable-Giant-Floating-Baby-Head-Attract-inator! (Thunder and lightning) Everything I know about getting a baby's attention has gone into this inator. (Zoom to top of -inator, a set of keys is on it) Yes! Babies like keys, right? When you shake your keys.(Zoom back) Yeah, it's...it's one of the things they like. (He pushes a button on a remote and the roof opens up. Thunder and lightning as the Giant Floating Baby Head floats up silhouetted. It floats into the light cooing.) It's so horrible! (Walks up to it.) Gently, gently. Don't kill me. Just one...small...touch. (He touches the Baby Head and falls backwards into a pile of empty boxes.) It's gone! (He gasps as he sees that three of his four fingers now have baby faces on them.) Perry the Platypus, look at my hand! It's-It's kind of disturbing, but it worked! I get three wishes! Okay, we'll give this a whirl. I'll use one wish just to test it out. Hmm. I wish for an iced tea! (Poof!) Well, look at that! It worked! Hmm. Not bad, though it could really use some sugar and one of those lemon slices. I wasn't, see, I wasn't specific enough. Oh, right, I forgot, in these kinds of stories, there's always a twist, but, but I'm too smart for that. All I have to do is be really clear about what I want. Like, my next wish, I'll be really sure to clearly say, ""I wish to control..."" (Perry struggles to get out of his trap and crashes the bookshelf on Doofenshmirtz's foot) Ow! Cheese and crackers! (Poof) Oh, you think you're so clever, don't you, Perry the Platypus, making me waste a wish? Nice try, pal, but what you don't realize is that this guy knows the real waste of a wasted wish is to waste the wish that was wished wastefully. And I am not wasting this wasteful wish. The point is I now have control over cheese and crackers! Cheese, advance! (The refrigerator opens up and several cheeses come out.) Swiss, smoky Gouda, string, individually wrapped cheese food substitute! A'ight? Cheese, snack attack! You, Limburger, h-h-hold on a second, you're a strong cheese. Get this bookshelf off my foot."
4,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, man, if I wasn't so hungry, this would be horrifying. (Perry is surrounded by several strands of shredded cheeses.) Well, you may have shredded it, but you haven't stopped it! (The shreds all come at Perry. Doofenshmirtz laughs evilly. Perry then kneels down and begins eating the shreds.) Oh, I see. I don't know how I forgot that cheese is edible. By the way, I believe you're over the five-second rule there, Perry the Platy— (Perry flings himself at Doofenshmirtz's head.) Ow! Well, I hope you didn't leave room for crackers! Crackers, go get 'im! (A cabinet opens and several boxes of oyster crackers fly out.) Why do I have six boxes of oyster crackers? Must've been on sale. (The boxes open and fire crackers at Perry.) Eh?"
4,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Very clever, Perry the Platypus, but let's see how you do against the hard stuff. Parmesan, give 'im a taste of your crystalline texture."
4,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, so you beat up a bunch of snacks. Big deal. But you forget, Perry the Platypus, I still have one wish left and I've learned from my past two mistakes. I'm going to do this one right! You know what it is I want, Perry the Platypus? I want to be the biggest ruler of the...What? Oh, you're right. I say ""ruler"" and I could end up being like a big wooden yardstick or something. G-Good catch. Good, good catch, Perry the Platypus. Let me rephrase that. I want to be, specifically, the monarch of—No, no. No, you're right, that's a butterfly. Well, how about, the super-inten—no, no. Wait, wait, I know! I wish to be the head of the Tri-State Area! Oh, shoot, I just heard that!"
4,25,Giant Floating Doofy Head,"Yep. Yep, I'm a head. A big old head, Perry the Platypus. That's what I wished for. (Perry leaves.) Where're you goin'? So what? I don't need your help! That's right! Just walk away,(Agent P walks to the door. He opens the door and leaves with a smiling) Perry the Platypus! Oh, you're giving me the smirk face! Nice, fine! Maybe I like being a giant head, huh? Uh, oh. Uhp, I have to itch my nose! Oh, no! I can't...Ah...AH-CHOO! (The Giant Floating Doofy Head's sneeze causes him to crash into the computer. An inexplicable cat screech is heard.) Ow! Curse you, Perry the Platypus, and you, too, you Giant inexplicable Floating Baby Head!! (Thunder and lightning) Ah, knock it off!"
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"At dot dot dot, ""funny what?"", add the picture and...(notices the viewer) Ah! Back from the commercial, are we? (picks up the book) Shall I continue, hmm? The final grim installment in our Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror takes place in an unassuming suburban backyard, where five happy campers and their platypus discover they may not know what they're going to do today."
4,25,Buford,"Suddenly, from out of the shadows, (making a shadow puppet) the zombie bunny rabbit appeared and then he...ate up all the marshmallows!!! Numnumnumnumnumnunmnum!!!"
4,25,Baljeet,"Remember, those marshmallows are for everyone!"
4,25,Buford,Zombie bunny don't care!
4,25,Phineas,"Okay, it's my turn to tell a scary story."
4,25,Isabella,"Ooh! What's it gonna be? Suspense, stalker, horror, action adventure, or my personal favorite, the campy costume alien teen romance comedy?"
4,25,Phineas,"Well, let's see what's in this weird book. ""Make a Doll Come Alive,"" ""How to Get Three Wishes,"" ""Giant Floating Rest of Baby""...Hey, check it out! It says here you have to be careful not to spill grape juice on a platypus, or it will make an evil platypus clone. I'm not really sure why anyone would—"
4,25,Buford,Keep readin'.
4,25,Phineas,"Buford, stop! (dries Perry off with a towel and bundles him like a baby) Aw, poor little guy. Buford, you shouldn't pour anything on a platypus!"
4,25,Buford,(offscreen) I just wanted to see what would happen.
4,25,Phineas,"(unbundling Perry) Well, he's dry, but now he's purple. (The purple stain jumps off of Perry and creates a purple platypus.) Whoa!"
4,25,Buford,Cool! It actually worked! (sticking a finger out) Who's my little platypus clone? (The clone snarls at Buford.) What was that all about?
4,25,Baljeet,"What part of ""evil clone"" are you not getting?"
4,25,Buford,"Obviously, the ""evil"" part."
4,25,Isabella,I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit! It's the only way to be sure.
4,25,Buford,Cheese and crackers!
4,25,Baljeet,Oh no! Look! They are using our grape juice box to make more!
4,25,Phineas,"Wow, this is such a Halloween thing to happen in the middle of summer."
4,25,Isabella,"What are we gonna do, Phineas?"
4,25,Phineas,"We have to contain these duplicating evil platypuses somehow. (paces) Uh, we could build a vacuum that attracts only platypus fur. No, no, then Perry would be in danger. Uh, maybe an alpha-ray grid to...No, no..."
4,25,Buford,(aside to Baljeet) I can smell his brain workin'.
4,25,Baljeet,"Oh, sure, blame it on Phineas."
4,25,Phineas,"I dunno, gang. I'm kinda stumped on this one."
4,25,Baljeet,Fear not! I know someone who can help us! Follow me!
4,25,Phineas,"I don't get it, Baljeet. Where are we going?"
4,25,Baljeet,"Whenever I need counsel on a problem, I go to my life coach."
4,25,Buford,Life coach?! I am so hurt!
4,25,Baljeet,"(ringing the doorbell) Buford, this man is the embodiment of pure thought and wisdom."
4,25,Cowboy,"Well, well, if'n it ain't Baljeet!"
4,25,Baljeet,"Everyone, this is Rusty Britches. Rusty, this is everyone."
4,25,Rusty,"Well, I'm right pleased to meet you kids!"
4,25,Isabella,Wha...Howdy?
4,25,Rusty,"Well, don't just stand there with your hair on your head and your socks tucked into your boots, come on in!"
4,25,Isabella,"Thank you for the lemonade, Rusty."
4,25,Rusty,"You're surely welcome! Now, what can I do you for?"
4,25,Phineas,"If I may, Mr. Britches, the city's been overrun by evil platypuses and we can't figure out how to get rid of 'em."
4,25,Rusty,"Well, that's a real beehive in your well water. Lemme get my thinkin' bench. (He walks off and a loud creaking noise is heard. He comes back and drags a bench across the floor. He puts one boot on it.) Well, it's like old Pap used to say, ""When your horse starts drawin' a bath instead of a wagon, it's time to change the welcome mat."""
4,25,Buford,Does anyone else get the feelin' we're really takin' our time with this thing?
4,25,Phineas,"Look, Rusty, we really appreciate your colloquial prairie wisdom, but I think we have to move along before things get worse out there."
4,25,Rusty,"Well, I reckon you know best. It was right fine to meet you... (His foot accidentally tips the lemonade glass on the bench over.) Aw, cheese and crackers! (He gets out a small brush and cleans up the spilt lemonade.) This is supposed to be for cleanin' boats, but sometimes, ya gotta wash with the wrong brush to get a colt to the chaparral."
4,25,Phineas,Wash? Brush?
4,25,Ferb,Chaparral?
4,25,Phineas,"That's it! You're a genius, Mr. Britches!"
4,25,Rusty,"Aw, shucks. I'm just a simple cowboy life coach."
4,25,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
4,25,Phineas,"So since the evil platypuses are made out of grape juice stains and dark magic, these high-powered bubble washers oughta do the trick. Okay, suds up, people! We're goin' platy-scrubbin'!"
4,25,Rusty,"(picking up a guitar) Hey, Phineas, how 'bout some good ol', down-home, granny-slappin', platy-scrubbin' musical accompaniment?"
4,25,All,Yeah!

4,25,Buford,"Hey, hey hey hey! What the heck, man?! Ya bringin' us down!"
4,25,Phineas,"It's really...a good song, but, uh..."
4,25,Isabella,"Maybe you could play something a little more, you know, up-tempo."
4,25,Rusty,"Oh, right! Gotcha!"
4,25,Baljeet,Rusty!
4,25,Rusty,"G'wan without me! It's like I always say, ""You gotta..."" (Before he can finish his saying, the platypuses pinch his nose and pull him down.)"
4,25,Phineas,"This doesn't look too good, Ferb! Everybody retreat to that factory!"
4,25,Phineas,"Oh, no, guys! This is a grape juice box factory!"
4,25,Baljeet,How terrifyingly specific!
4,25,Isabella,They're here!
4,25,Buford,Run!!!
4,25,Isabella,There's too many of them! PHINEAS!! (The platypuses attack Isabella and Baljeet.)
4,25,Phineas,"Isabella!! (Phineas runs back, but gets attacked.)"
4,25,Buford,I'm gettin' tired of runnin' from these jerks! (The platypuses attack Buford and Ferb.)
4,25,Phineas,(voiceover) And so our heroes were ripped to shreds...
4,25,Phineas,...and left to die.

4,25,Buford,Talk about your unlightful endings.
4,25,Baljeet,"He means ""delightful"" and he means the opposite of that."
4,25,Phineas,"Okay, okay. I'll give you the Hollywood ending."
4,25,Phineas,I have a plan. Everyone keep your eye out for the sprinkler system supply housing.
4,25,Isabella,There it is!
4,25,Phineas,"Isabella, you, Baljeet, and Buford hold them back while we get the soap into the sprinkler system!"
4,25,Isabella,"You better hurry, Phineas!"
4,25,Baljeet,There are too many of them!
4,25,Phineas,"Oh, no! The manual override is way up there! There's no way I can reach it!"
4,25,Isabella,"Uh, guys, I'm out!"
4,25,Baljeet,"I am out, too!"
4,25,Buford,What are we gonna do?!
4,25,Rusty,Yeehaw!!
4,25,Buford,"Look, everyone! It's Baljeet's cowboy life coach! On a unicorn! Straining all credulity, he has come to save us!"
4,25,Rusty,"Soap's on, little tykes!"
4,25,Baljeet,"Rusty, you did it! They are all melting away!"
4,25,Grape Juice Cop,You've saved my factory!

4,25,Buford,Nah. The cowboy.
4,25,Baljeet,You do not believe in cowboys?
4,25,Buford,Have you ever seen one in real life?
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"So, you see, if I had a Macabre Book Mobile, those are the kinds of things that could happen."
4,25,Bank Officer,"I'm gonna be blunt, Mr. Macabre..."
4,25,Mr. Macabre,It's Macabré.
4,25,Bank Officer,"Mr. Macabré, I'm not gonna give ya a loan to buy a Macabre Book Mobile."
4,25,Mr. Macabre,And why not?
4,25,Bank Officer,"You have no detailed records of assets, no inventory, nothing you could use as collateral. Your stories don't even make sense! It's a bad business proposition."
4,25,Mr. Macabre,"What if I were to say, ""Please""?"
4,25,Bank Officer,That's not gonna work.
4,25,Mr. Macabre,Please?
4,25,Bank Officer,Get out!

4,31,Major Monogram,"Greetings from Montevillebad, Agent P! You'll be joining us here for your mission. (whispering) But the lines aren't secure. (normal voice) So, we'll give you the details when you get here. And to get you here in style, we've provided you with a vintage 1963 Olson Martin! (The car rises from the floor behind Perry. He smiles.) So I'll see you after the wipe."
4,31,Caption,Montevillebad...After the wipe
4,31,Major Monogram,"Hello again, Agent P. International intel has indicated that Doofenshmirtz is planning to sabotage Paolo Vanderbeek and enter the Grand Prix himself. (Cut to Perry driving.) So, we need you to find out what Doof is up to while Carl and I keep an eye on Vanderbeek here at the race track incognito. (Cut to Monogram, now wearing a fake black mustache.) Nifty disguise, huh? Gives me a continental look, don't you think? Anyway, Doofenshmirtz is at the casino L'Hotel Uber-Swank."
4,31,Croupier,Monsieur in the lab coat and bow tie wins again.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Man, I am on a roll!"
4,31,Agent Double 0-0,(gets up) Stupid game. I'll never play it again.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, never say never! Who's next? (Cut to Perry who takes a stick of bubblegum and chews it seriously and blows a bubble.) Oh, a mysterious platypus to take my challenge. Okay, I'll go first."
4,31,Croupier,Jeu de morpion! Monsieur Platypus in the tuxedo wins!
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,What?!
4,31,Bouncer,"Monsieur, there are no pets allowed in the casino."
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"What? He's not my mysterious platypus. I didn't bring him in here! I just—Oh, oh, you mean the cat. (Doof takes a white cat from under the table and leaves.) Yeah, my bad."
4,31,Adrian,Look at all those cars in a line.
4,31,Nigel,The collective amount of horsepower is absolutely staggering.
4,31,Ian,And so (coughs) are the exhaust fumes.
4,31,Candace,You realize this is just a bunch of cars parked in a line.
4,31,Linda and Lawrence,Yes. Yes we do.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasp) The mysterious platypus from the casino! (Perry puts on his fedora.) Perry the Mysterious Platypus from the Casino?!?!? Betcha tired of standing 'round, aren't you? (Doof pushes a button and traps Perry in a pile of tires.) See? Tires. I thought it apropos, you know, this being the Grand Prix and all. Wait 'till you see my new lair! (The yacht drives into a cave tunnel.) Not too shabby. Hey, Norm, I'm back!"
4,31,Norm,Look what I found! Metal teeth!
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Uch, you've always had metal teeth, Norm."
4,31,Norm,"Yes, but these are sharp."
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"What does that matter? You can't open your mouth. Here, grab Perry the Platypus. Isn't this place fabulous? I found it through an international lair exchange website. It's even got its own rocket. Y'know, I think I might've gotten the better end of this deal."
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Anyway, you're gonna love it. I was so impressed, I commissioned a whole new jingle!"

4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Thanks, Cheryl! (to the viewer) My real estate agent. (to Perry) So, my evil plan. As you may know, the Montevillebad Grand Prix is a goodwill event with all the prize money awarded to the winner's favorite charity. So, I entered the race for my favorite charity, Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated...namely me! I'm the Doofenshmirtz...in Doofenshmirtz Evil...Well, you get it. And check it out! (Shows his race car on the monitor.) I've re-engineered my Boomshlaka 320-I to meet the Grand Prix specs. I also added some extras that should take care of, like, 99% of the playing field. But then there's still that 1%, Paolo Vanderbeek. But, uh, I got something else to take care of him. Behold, my I-Don't-Care-inator! (beat) It's not that I don't care. It creates apathy in whoever it hits. It's a little esoteric, I know, but, trust me, it'll work. I'll just zap Paolo with this baby and suddenly he won't care about anything and, uh, least of all, racing. I'll turn the King of Care into the King of I Couldn't Care Less, which will pave the way for me to win the race and the prize money for my favorite charity, which, I think I said before, is me. Now, before I go, lest you try to escape, I'll show you one more feature of this place. (He presses a button that says ""Shark Tank"".) Look, it's got its own shark tank! (laughter) (Cut to Norm wearing a rocket helmet. Doof straps into a seat on the robot.) Okay, then, I'm off to the races...literally! (Norm launches.) Hasta la pasta, baby!"
4,31,Adrian,"Welcome back, racing fans, to the Montevillebad Grand Prix. And the teams are making the final preparations before the start of the race."
4,31,Ian,"Including our favorite, Paolo Vanderbeek."
4,31,Nigel,Just look at the amazing amount of care and attention he pays to his fans and his car.
4,31,Pit Man,"Listen to those fans, Paolo. They love you."
4,31,Vanderbeek,"Eh, who cares? (walks away)"
4,31,Adrian,What's this? Paolo is walking away from the pits.
4,31,Nigel,And the race.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha ha! What a shot! Norm, set me down next to the registration booth and you go get the car ready."
4,31,Norm,"Roger wilco, sir!"
4,31,Adrian,Wait a second. There seems to be a last minute entry. A Heinz Doofen...Doofen.... Ih...hopeless with Drusselsteinian names.
4,31,Nigel,"Hand it over, mate. Let's see. (takes the script from Adrian and reads it) ""Dorkenshmitz""?"
4,31,Ian,"D-Doofen...Doofenshmuntz, Doofenshmuntz. Oh, that's utterly ridiculous."
4,31,Adrian,"Whatever his name is, he's no Vanderbeek. That's for sure."
4,31,Nigel,There's the flag! And they're off!
4,31,Major Monogram,"Psst, Agent P, over here! Doof has shot Vanderbeek with some kind of—oh, right, he probably monologued his scheme to you already. Anyhow, we need you to take Vanderbeek's place in the race, get that inator, and get back here to reverse its effect, so Vanderbeek can finish the race and defeat Doofenshmirtz. Carl has been trying to convince Vanderbeek to get back in the race using his sophisticated powers of persuasion."
4,31,Carl,"C'mon, pretty please? Pretty please with a cherry on top? I'll be your best friend!"
4,31,Major Monogram,"Yeah, you better get goin', Agent P. You can use the disguise setting on your Olson Martin. (Perry takes his Olson Martin out of his pocket, pushes a button, and it turns into Vanderbeek's mustache. He puts it on.) Wow, the resemblance is uncanny! Good luck, Agent P!"
4,31,Nigel,What's this? Hello! It looks like Paolo Vanderbeek is back in the race!
4,31,Candace,"Wow, this isn't nearly as lame as I thought."
4,31,Lawrence,That's why our couch cushions are worn so unevenly. 'Cause we're always on the edge of our seats.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Let's see if I can rub this guy the wrong way. (He laughs as he rams a car.) Nice bumpin' into ya! Maybe it's time to use a little elbow grease. (He pushes a button and some grease spews out of the back of his car causing the car to slide right out of the race.) Alright, smoke 'em if you got 'em! (Black smoke spews out of the exhaust pipe.)"
4,31,Nigel,"Approaching the Phillips' head turn, millimetrically perfect!"
4,31,Adrian,Or .04 inches perfect for backwards people who don't use the metric system.
4,31,Nigel,Dumpendork is gonna have his work cut out for him if he wants to stay in the lead.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Paolo Vanderbeek? He's back? Eh, looks like I'm gonna have to through the works at him. There ya go. (The exhaust pipe flips open throwing everything...and the kitchen sink which the car dodges.)"
4,31,Nigel,"I say, that is an unprecedented amount of contact shunts and shenanigans!"
4,31,Adrian,Shenanigans?
4,31,Ian,You don't think there's some sort of foul play afoot.
4,31,Adrian,In Grand Prix racing? Don't be ridiculous!
4,31,Nigel,That kind of thing only happens in cartoons.
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,Looks like somebody needs another shot of the I-Don't-Care-inator. (The car runs over some parts and the inator slips out of Doof's hand.) What? Uh-oh! That's mine! (Perry catches the inator.)
4,31,Adrian,And that last contact has put Doofenshmuntz spinning across the course!
4,31,Nigel,And Vanderbeek is pulling into the pits! What is wrong?
4,31,Carl,"Come on, whatta ya, chicken? Bagawk!"
4,31,Major Monogram,"Good work, Agent P! Now we just need you to...Oh, okay, yeah, you got it covered, too."
4,31,Vanderbeek,Bocce balls! I cannot disappoint my fans!
4,31,Ian,Doifenshmuntz has got himself going again with the help of an extremely large metal pit crew member.
4,31,Nigel,"This is, without a doubt, the weirdest race I've ever seen."
4,31,Vanderbeek,"Grazie tonto, little beaver-duck guy! I'm-a about to win-a!"
4,31,Ian,And Paolo is back on the course!
4,31,Adrian,He'll have to really put his foot in if he wants to catch Doofenshmintz by the end of the race!
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Not to make excuses, but sometimes, it's okay to be a little bit tacky. (He pushes a button and a bunch of tacks come out of the front, piercing his own tires.) Oh, maybe the tacks are supposed to be in the back."
4,31,Adrian,Dirkenshplurtz has run himself off the course completely!
4,31,Pool Guy,"Gladys, j'ai une autre. (Subtitle: Gladys, we have another one.)"
4,31,Nigel,And Vanderbeek pushes past just in time to sieze the checkered flag! Well done!
4,31,Candace,"Oh, yeah! Go, Paolo! Go, Paolo!"
4,31,Linda,Woo-hoo!
4,31,Lawrence,What an exciting finish!
4,31,Candace,"That was awesome! (looks behind her to see nothing there) Huh, I guess they're not doing anything today. (leaves) I am going to the mall and picking up a pleather jumpsuit!"
4,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, did I win? (He takes off his helmet, which splashes more water onto him.) Oh, wait, no! Curse you, Paolo Vanderbeek! Y'know, that just doesn't roll off the tongue the way ""Perry the Platypus"" does. Perry the Platypus, Perry the Platypus."

4,35,Isabella,"Well, we only have so many folding chairs."
4,35,Buford,Maybe it would help if your puppets were bigger.
4,35,Phineas,"What do you mean, Buford?"
4,35,Buford,My uncle Oslo from Oslo used to make huge marionette puppets!
4,35,Buford,"(voiceover) People would come from miles around to see 'em. Or at least they would have, if he ever finished one."
4,35,Phineas,"Wait, Oslo's in Norway. I thought your family was Dutch."
4,35,Buford,Eh.
4,35,Phineas,"Nevertheless, Buford, I think you may be onto something. (to Isabella) We can build a huge weird puppet, and you guys could take your marionette skills to the people in the streets."

4,35,Isabella,"(sarcastically) Nothing! I uh, was just...heh heh heh—Hey, where's Perry?"

4,35,Carl,"(offscreen) Lagomorph, sir."
4,35,Major Monogram,"What's that, Carl?"
4,35,Carl,"(offscreen) Sir, they used to be considered rodents, but were reclassified in the early twentieth century."
4,35,Major Monogram,"Oh, well, I'll have to fix that then. Carl, run out and buy me a new set of encyclopedias."
4,35,Carl,"(offscreen) A set of what, sir?"
4,35,Major Monogram,"Hmm. Anyway, Dennis, the most wanted lagomorph, miraculously escaped from O.W.C.A.'s maximum security prison sometime this morning. Evidence suggests that Dennis was snatched away by a ninja-disco-robot. If this isn't the work of Doofenshmirtz, (Perry takes off) then Carl will eat my hat."
4,35,Carl,(offscreen) Hey!
4,35,Driver,(offscreen) I got your 22 and 1/2 tons of reclaimed pine logs.

And I am...like, totally cool with that! See, I want to defeat Perry the Platypus and take over the Tri-State Area, and what I think I'm lacking is a certain animal instinct to get the job done. You have animal instincts, but what you lack is the evil scientist technology. And that is something that I have. So using my evil scientist skills, I'll make it possible for you to defeat Perry the Platypus while I watch from a safe distance. And together, we'll take over THE TRI-STATE AREA!! Whadaya say? Are you with me? (Dennis holds up his fist.) Great! I always wanted a rodent for a partner."

4,35,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, before I let you loose on the O.W.C.A., this should make you much more formidable. (shows a backpack, but walks down the still moving up escalator) I like to call it my...my...my my my mymmymy (JANE! STOP THIS CRAZY THING!) I guess the escalator wasn't such a good idea after all. Oh, well. Live and learn. Anyway, I like to call it my Transmogrification-Backpack-inator! (straps it on Dennis) It'll give you a robotic exoskeleton that can transform into almost anything. And it's perfect to wear undercover, so no one will ever suspect. Except, maybe, to say, ""Hey, look, there's a rabbit wearing a backpack."" Go ahead! Give it a try! (A giant hand appears on Dennis' right paw, which blows a hole in the roof.) Hey! What the heck, man?! I live here! You can't go blowing holes in my stuff! (the robotic hand disappears) Now, try it again. (The inator produces a giant robotic body onto Dennis with huge hands, which he uses to hulksmash the floor.) Eh. Okay. Also, no smashing things in here! I'm gunna have to make a list for you, aren't I? (Dennis blasts off) Hey! Wait! Let me open the— (CRASH!) roof."

4,35,Stacy,Maybe he's down at the docks.
4,35,Candace,"Yeah, maybe he—""Down at the docks?"""
4,35,Stacy,Or maybe he's just playing with his friends.
4,35,Dennis,(growls)
4,35,Doofenshmirtz,"Time to see how my little friend is doing. (to the camera) You see, I installed a bunch of nanobot cameras on his backpack."
4,35,Norm,Who installed them?
4,35,Doofenshmirtz,"It was my idea! (turns on the TV) Oh, there he is. And he's fighting a giant puppet girl. What? There's something very familiar about the way she fights. Wait a minute. (The puppet punches the camera and the screen goes to static.) Perry the Platypus?! (Gets off the chair) That does it! I'm going down there!"
4,35,Phineas,"The big difference is that the marionette has strings, while a puppet is hollow, so it can be manipulated from within. But that doesn't mean that a marionette can't be hollow or a puppet has strings. The thing to remember is that some people take the subject very seriously, even though, technically, there's no difference grammatically. I looked it up."
4,35,Doofenshmirtz,"(offscreen) There he is, Norm! Down there! On top of the puppet! (Doof gets lowered on the rope ladder.) Lower! Perfect! (Falls down.) Aah! Gotcha! Heh heh! Give up, Perry the Platypus! You know nothing of puppetry— (Perry manipulates the puppet to punch Doof.) Ow! Okay, I-I admit it, y-you do have a certain knack for it. (Perry manipulates it some more. Wide shot to reveal Doof tied up in the strings.) Okay. Well, maybe, ""knack"" wasn't the right word. (Perry manipulates it to flick Doof off.) Oh no. No no! (Doof gets flicked off the head.) Whoa! (The puppet dives into the ocean.) Curse you, Perry the—blub! (Coughs.) Platypus. I was trying to say, ""Platypus."""

4,35,Candace,But he's... (to Phineas) Do I have to?
4,35,Phineas,"Well, he is a lagomorph."
4,35,Candace,"Oh, okay. (gives Dennis to Monogram) Here."
4,35,Major Monogram,You've been a bad little bunny. (walks off with Carl) Now let's get you back to your...special room.
4,35,Candace,I don't know. There was something weird about those two.
4,35,Phineas,"Whadaya mean, Candace? Rabbit owners come in all shapes and sizes."
4,35,Candace,A flight helmet and cowboy boots?
4,35,Stacy,I think the tall one was wearing a wig.
4,35,Ferb,And the other one had a false mustache.

4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Struggle all you want, Perry the Platypus, you're not getting out of that! It's hydraulic! I don't know if you're aware of this, but my brother, Roger, is the mayor. (Perry just gives him a look indicating that he was, in fact, aware of it.) Alright, I may have touched upon the subject from time to time, but, y'know, I figured why not mention it again just for clarity? Anyway, that job gives him all these cool mayoral powers. So I created the Power-Drain-inator to drain all his powers into this canister, and then I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, get to wield them! Just think, I will have the power to raise taxes, pass legislation and even cut the ceremonial ribbon at openings! Where I'll finally be able to use (He produces a pair of giant scissors from behind his back) these! You like them? I-I got 'em at a garage sale. (He leans the scissors onto a hydraulic pump, which leaks and releasing Perry from his trap.) Ah, see? Th-th-that's one of those hydraulic lines that, uh, goes to your— (Perry flings himself at Doofenshmirtz, who falls backwards, and then takes the inator, smashing it to pieces.) Aw, come on!!!

4,21,Iron Man,Something's wrong. I can't move!
4,21,Thor,"Sit tight! Mighty Mjolnir will bring them down! (He attempts to throw the hammer, but it crashes into the ground.) My strength, it's gone!"
4,21,Hulk,"I'll go. (Hulk tries to smash, but nothing happens.)"
4,21,Iron Man,"Somehow our powers have been drained. I need to get to JARVIS and figure this out. Let's get back to S.H.I.E.L.D. (The heroes all walk away, except for Iron Man who attempts to move, but remains immobile.) Hey, guys! My power's down and my suit's frozen! Could somebody get me a hand?"
4,21,Spider-Man,"Hulk, can you carry him?"
4,21,Hulk,"My power's gone, too."
4,21,Iron Man,"Oh, for— Well, can somebody find a furniture dolly?"
4,21,Buford,That was the best thing we've done this morning!
4,21,Candace,Mom! Hurry! Here! Look!
4,21,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
4,21,Linda,"Hi, kids!"
4,21,Candace,Why aren't you in space?
4,21,Buford,"Eh, we got hungry."
4,21,Linda,"Oh, that's my cue! I'll make you guys some snacks before I leave!"
4,21,Spider-Man,"Well, this stinks! Without my spider-powers, I'm just a guy in a body stocking!"
4,21,Thor,And I had to leave Mjolnir in the street!
4,21,Thor,It just became too heavy.
4,21,Iron Man,"At least you guys aren't locked inside this metal suit. Man, do I regret having that second cup of coffee this morning. Now we have to find out where that beam came from."
4,21,Nick Fury,"Danville. Danville, USA."
4,21,Spider-Man,Have you been standing there this whole time?
4,21,Nick Fury,"Yes. Yes I have. (He walks to a screen which shows the inator beam hitting the space station satellite) The beam that hit you originated from the Tri-State Area, bounced off a space station satellite dish, and hit you in New York City during your fight."
4,21,Spider-Man,Is that one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s?
4,21,Nick Fury,No. It's theirs.
4,21,Spider-Man,"Man, that kid's got a weird-shaped head."
4,21,Iron Man,"(jumping) Hey! Hey! Guys, I can't see with the— (falls down) Little help here?"
4,21,Hulk,I got him.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Make sure you get all these little pieces over here, too. No no no, y-you're missing the big one."
4,21,Norm,Okey-dokey!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Y'know, Norm, the Power-Drain-inator did get one shot off before it died. I wonder if it hit anything."
4,21,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"(on television) Dateline: New York City. A mysterious ray has drained the power from four of our beloved superheroes. We now return you to Horse in a Bookcase, already in progress."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"That was me! Th-Th-That was me! I drained the power from those superheroes! Winning! Ooh, ooh, I should update my evil blog on the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. site! (sits down at the computer and types) OMG!! I drained all the powers from a group of superheroes in New York , and those powers belong to me now! Happy Emoticon (Typed out as >:D >:D >:D) And send! Norm, let's get the powers out of the canister so I can start wielding them! I-I can't wait to fly and run fast and carry a big hammer around for no reason!"
4,21,Norm,"Uh, sir, I hate to be the bearer of empty canisters, but this canister is empty."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,What?! So I don't have the powers?
4,21,Norm,"Time to blog a retraction, I guess."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, y'know, I'm not gonna change it. Everyone exaggerates on the Internet."
4,21,Red Skull,There vas a slight miscalculation. It becomes clearer upon seeing zis footage.
4,21,Whiplash,"That is more than a slight miscalculation, Red Skull. It's a major mistake!"
4,21,Venom,We could have destroyed the heroes once and for all!
4,21,Red Skull,Enough! It doesn't change ze fact zat ze heroes are now powerless!
4,21,Whiplash,"Well, what could have happened to their powers?"
4,21,Red Skull,MODOK?
4,21,MODOK,"I, MODOK, the perfect combination of human intellect and machine, have interfaced with all of the digital information stored on the vast network, the World Wide Web!"
4,21,Whiplash,I can do the same thing with my phone. Plus I got free roaming!
4,21,Venom,Nice!
4,21,MODOK,"As I was saying, I have found some puny inferior human known as Doofenshmirtz claiming that he has drained the heroes of all their superpowers."
4,21,Red Skull,"Hmm, Doofenshmirtz. Zat sounds Drusselshteinian. I have a cousin who married a Drusselshteinian. She is dead to me!! So, who is zis Doofenshmirtz?"
4,21,MODOK,I'm projecting his image now.
4,21,Red Skull,He is beautifully grotesque.
4,21,Whiplash,All hideous and deformed.
4,21,Venom,He must have some backstory.
4,21,Red Skull,Vere can we find zis sideshow freak?
4,21,MODOK,"(showing an image of D.E.I.) He's in the Tri-State Area, Danville to be precise!"
4,21,Red Skull,"Danville, eh? Gentlemen, it looks like we're going on an evil road trip."
4,21,MODOK,"Ooh, shotgun!"
4,21,Red Skull,YOU DO NOT FIT IN ZE SHOTGUN POSITION!!!!
4,21,Phineas,"Well, that was fun, and it's only 10:30. What else should we do today?"
4,21,Linda,"Oh, hey, kids. I'm gonna be taking a walking tour of the Tri-State Area today. (her phone rings) Yes, Candace, you're in charge."
4,21,Candace,Whoopee!!
4,21,Linda,"Bye, kids."
4,21,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry? Oh, there he is!"
4,21,Computer,Platypus trap engaged.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platyp—You're not Perry the Platypus! Who are you guys?"
4,21,Red Skull,"Zis is Vhiplash, zis is Venom, and I am Red Skull."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes. Yes, you are. Y'know, you really should use sunblock. Y-You're burned down to the bone."
4,21,MODOK,"I am MODOK, and you are the one they call ""Doofenshmirtz""."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, yeah. That's what they sing at the end of the birthday song...Ah, well, y'know, at least they...would have if...anybody ever sang....that song to me. Anyway...Hey, the floating head and little arms thing. I-I tried that back in the '90s."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,I'll rule the Tri-State Areaaaa! (bumps into a wall)
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"I could never maneuver out the front door, but I see you're pretty mobile. W-What are you guys doing here?"
4,21,Red Skull,"Shos your davices, Doofenshmirtz!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"""Shess-so-davices?"" I-Is that Latin?"
4,21,Red Skull,Show us your devices.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,I-I-I-I-I'm still not gettin' it. Anyone?
4,21,Whiplash,I have no idea.
4,21,Red Skull,(grunts) Show...us...your...devices!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, you want to see my inators! Man...Man, you've got quite an accent there! Alright, (walks up to an inator) here's what I'm workin' on now. Behold, the Slothinator! It will give me the powers of a sloth...which are super-slowness and super-leaf-eating."
4,21,Red Skull,(to MODOK) Are you sure zis is ze right guy?
4,21,MODOK,MODOK is infallible!
4,21,Red Skull,Then he must be toying with us. Playing us for fools! He is even more diabolical than we thought!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"(holding up a branch) Seriously, I'll be able to eat this whole branch, but...y'know, like, slowly."
4,21,Phineas,"Ferb, are you expecting someone?"
4,21,Ferb,Not them.
4,21,Spider-Man,(offscreen) Aren't you a little young to be stealing superheroes' superpowers?
4,21,Phineas,"Yes. Yes, we would be, Spider-Man, if we actually did it. But like I said, I don't think we did."
4,21,Iron Man,"You can't see it, but I have a rather severe look of disappointment on my face."
4,21,Isabella,This'll turn that tin frown upside-down!
4,21,Thor,Juice in a box? We have nothing like this in Asgard.
4,21,Hulk,(grunting) Straw cannot penetrate!
4,21,Spider-Man,"Hey, hey, hey! Calm blue ocean. (taking the juice box) Let me take care of that for ya, buddy."
4,21,Iron Man,"Thanks, Isabella. Well, the power-siphoning ray originated from the Tri-State Area. And I was thinking you guys would know something about it since it bounced off your space station."
4,21,Phineas,Are you sure it was our space station?
4,21,Hulk,It was shaped like your head.
4,21,Phineas,"Well, that sounds like ours, but we don't know anything about a power-siphoning ray."
4,21,Iron Man,"I was afraid of that. Well, the first thing we gotta do is get our powers back."
4,21,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna d—"
4,21,Candace,"(coming down the stairs) Alright, boys and girls, listen up, Mom's on a walking tour of Danville and Dad's tinkering in the basement, so I'm in charge. That means no shenanigans! Hey, Spider-Man. So I'll be over at Stacy's all...d-d-d-daaay???!!!"
4,21,Spider-Man,'Sup?
4,21,Thor,"Greetings, fair young maiden."
4,21,Candace,It's super...heroes...in...duh...our...kitchen!
4,21,Isabella,Candace is gonna lie down for a while.
4,21,Candace,
4,21,Isabella,
4,21,Phineas,Looks like you guys have a fan.
4,21,Iron Man,"Oh, boy. (Tips over and an inexplicable cat is heard screeching.)"
4,21,Thor,And it's probably good she didn't see that.
4,21,Iron Man,I'm okay.
4,21,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
4,21,Major Monogram,"Have a seat, Agent P. (cut to reveal Monogram on an old black and white TV set) Due to the gravity of your mission today, the gentleman on the big screen will be addressing you (Wide shot to reveal Fury on the big screen) while I use this old TV monitor Carl found in the basement."
4,21,Carl,"(offscreen) Sorry, sir, I couldn't get the split-screen to work."
4,21,Major Monogram,"Anyway, this is director Nick Fury of S-H-I-E-L-D."
4,21,Nick Fury,That's S.H.I.E.L.D.! It's an acronym.
4,21,Major Monogram,"Oh, like ""OWCA""."
4,21,Nick Fury,"Yes, except it's cool. Now, where is your agent, Major?"
4,21,Major Monogram,He's sitting right there.
4,21,Nick Fury,You mean behind the platypus?
4,21,Major Monogram,"No, that's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus."
4,21,Nick Fury,Is he some kind of super-platypus with super-platypus powers?
4,21,Major Monogram,(suddenly wearing an eyepatch) Uh...no.
4,21,Nick Fury,Does he have some kind of robotic platypus exoskeleton?
4,21,Major Monogram,"He, uh, he has a fedora."
4,21,Nick Fury,"Hey, wait a minute, were you wearing that eyepatch when we started?!"
4,21,Major Monogram,"Oh, this? Uh, yeah. It's, uh, doctor's orders. I have a stye."
4,21,Carl,(offscreen) He thinks it makes him look cool.
4,21,Major Monogram,No I don't.
4,21,Nick Fury,"I'm going to proceed as if this were going really well. Agent P, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Spider-Man have lost their superpowers to a mysterious power-siphoning ray, which we believe originated somewhere in the Danville area. We fear a group of supervillains are closing in. We need you to monitor the situation and report back. (Monogram is now wearing eyepatches on both eyes.) Francis, I'm gonna need you to—Now what are you doing?"
4,21,Carl,(offscreen) He thinks two eyepatches make him look twice as cool.
4,21,Major Monogram,I don't know what you're talking about.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Welcome to my Hall of Inators. Ah, here's a good one. This is my Oatmeal-to-Porridge-inator. I know. It's a fine distinction. Don't get me started. And here's my Multi-Helio-Tactical-Baboon-Glom-inator. I-I-I think that one is self-explanatory. Oh, and, uh, here's my Waffle-inator, and the Junk-Mail-inator..."
4,21,Red Skull,I do not understand. Zees machines are useless. What is wrong wis zis man?
4,21,Whiplash,Maybe he is a misunderstood genius.
4,21,Red Skull,Or maybe he is a perfectly understood idiot.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"And, finally, my Disintegrator-inator. Pretty impressive, huh?"
4,21,Red Skull,Vere is ze machine zat took away the powers of the heroes?
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, my Power-Drain-inator! Ooh, that was a cool one! And it was...destroyed by my nemesis, Perry the Platypus. You just missed him."
4,21,Red Skull,Perry ze Platypus? Is he a super-soldier platypus?
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,No.
4,21,Venom,Was he bitten by a radioactive platypus?
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"No, he's, uh, just a regular crime-fighting platypus."
4,21,Red Skull,It is no matter! You will rebuild ze machine!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, so we're workin' together now! Great! I'll be the leader! I've always wanted an evil entourage."
4,21,Whiplash,Let's destroy him.
4,21,Red Skull,"Nein. Let him think he is in charge. Ven he has exceeded his usefulness, ve vill give him to MODOK to destroy."
4,21,Whiplash,"Hey, where is MODOK?"
4,21,MODOK,"D'oh! Curse you, Danville, town of small doors!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Listen, before I rebuild the machine, I've got some errands to run. You guys should come with. (Red Skull hisses) Is your head gonna burst into flames or am I thinking of somebody else?"
4,21,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen...and Hulk, allow me to unveil our Secret Hideout for Emergency Defects. Or S.H.E.D. for short."
4,21,Iron Man,I think we're gonna need something a little...bigger.
4,21,Phineas,"Oh, the rustic exterior's a facade. Wait'll you see the inside!"
4,21,Iron Man,"Oh, man! You guys are good!"
4,21,Ferb,Just a little British sci-fi technology.
4,21,Thor,"Iron Man, looks like someone raided your armory."
4,21,Phineas,"Oh, you like that, huh? This is The Beak Suit Mark 2. We're still working on the waterproofing so we can't take it out in the rain."
4,21,Iron Man,"You know, Stark Industries offers summer internships."
4,21,Phineas,"Thanks, but this summer's pretty packed."
4,21,Iron Man,Apparently.
4,21,Phineas,(handing some cards to the gang and the superheroes) And these are your S.H.E.D. key card IDs. They'll get you into all areas of the compound.
4,21,Spider-Man,Ooh! And they're laminated!
4,21,(Song,"""Free"" (instrumental))"
4,21,Candace,"(entering with a comic book) Um, hi. Heh. Would you guys read my fan-fiction? It's a story where Thor and Hulk decide to learn ice skating and—"
4,21,Spider-Man,"I'm sorry, but we're not allowed to accept unsolicited material."
4,21,Isabella,"Candace, I didn't know you were a fangirl."
4,21,Candace,"Oh, sure. From way back. It started 'cause I had to do a lot of research to get up to speed for the Ducky Momo superhero crossover event."
4,21,(Song,"""J-Pop (Welcome to Tokyo)"" (instrumental))"
4,21,Japanese Announcer,Quack quack Ducky Momo-san Sūpāhīrō desu!
4,21,Phineas,"Okay, superheroes. We have to get to work building a device that will restore your powers."
4,21,Candace,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hehehehehehehe!"
4,21,(Song,"""My Evil Buddies and Me"")"
4,21,(Unnamed Pop Trio,♪ Shoop doo be doo doop! ♪)
4,21,Phineas,"Until we find out what happened to your actual powers, this machine should be able to replicate them temporarily. Everyone in position and we'll start calibrating!"
4,21,Candace,Let's get our hero on!
4,21,Phineas,"Just a minute, Candace. We all set?"
4,21,Ferb,All set. Just as soon as I—
4,21,Candace,Great! All set!
4,21,Ferb,...lock down the power assignments and reverse polarity.
4,21,Phineas,"Candace, what did you do?!"
4,21,Candace,Uh-oh.
4,21,Phineas,Are you guys okay?
4,21,Thor,"By Odin's beard, I feel invigorated! (Jumps up high)"
4,21,Candace,See? It worked! Hmm?
4,21,Phineas,"Well, not exactly. Look."
4,21,Thor,Something is not right.
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Woo! Oh, boy, that was great! Hey, I've got an idea, let's go get some ice cream and spoil our dinner! I mean, who's gonna tell us no?"
4,21,Whiplash,That's it! I've had it! We're wasting our time! (takes out his whips and whips a Ducky Momo kiosk) We need to bring the heroes to us!
4,21,Kiosk Girl,Well...
4,21,Phineas,"Something's gone terribly wrong, Candace! You've swapped all their powers. (Cut to Thor wall crawling.) Obviously, Thor's got Spider-Man's powers. (Cut to Spidey lifting up something heavy.) Spider-Man got Hulk's powers."
4,21,Spider-Man,"Yeah, I could get used to this!"
4,21,Baljeet,I-I have a fear of heights. Could you please put us down?
4,21,Phineas,Iron Man must have Thor's powers.
4,21,Candace,"Well, at least he can move now."
4,21,Phineas,"Everyone has new superpowers except Hulk. He must have Iron Man's powers. But without the suit, there's not much there."
4,21,Hulk,I am feeling entrepreneurial.
4,21,Phineas,At least his vocabulary's improved.
4,21,Iron Man,"So give me the hammer. What do I do? I just stick out my hand, right? Come on, baby, come to papa!"
4,21,Thor,That is not how it works.
4,21,Iron Man,Whadaya mean? I got your powers.
4,21,Thor,"Wielding Mjolnir is about worthiness, not power."
4,21,Iron Man,Really?
4,21,Thor,"It's a fine distinction, but an important one."
4,21,Iron Man,"Potato, potahto."
4,21,Thor,I do not know what that means.
4,21,Iron Man,"Okay, nevermind. What about the lightning? How do I control that?"
4,21,Thor,"Actually, that only works with the hammer."
4,21,Iron Man,What about flying? I've seen you fly.
4,21,Thor,"Well, yes. But not without the—"
4,21,Iron Man,Not without the hammer. Right.
4,21,Phineas,"This is a disaster, Candace!"
4,21,Candace,"Look, it was an accident! But I can still help! I know that the villains will—"
4,21,Phineas,"No!!! You don't know!! The entire Tri-State Area, and, possibly, the world is at stake here! Honestly, Candace, if you don't know what you're doing, keep your hands off the machinery!"
4,21,Candace,"Well, then, maybe I should just leave!"
4,21,Phineas,Yeah! Maybe you should!
4,21,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"Alert! Alert! Relevant news broadcast intercepted! (The gang and the heroes walk up to the TVs.) This just in: Disaster in Danville! Horse in a Bookcase is cancelled after a nineteeen-year run.  Also, (Image of the Googolplex Mall appears on screen.) chaos at the Googolplex Mall! (Image of Venom, Whiplash and Red Skull in the mall appears on screen.) An evil entourage of three supervillains (file photo of Doof appears on screen) and what appears to be a pharmacist (image of MODOK appears on screen) and a giant chicken egg with a face are bustin' up the place somethin' fierce!"
4,21,Thor,We are needed!
4,21,Phineas,But you can't! Your powers! They're not fixed yet! We just need more time.
4,21,Iron Man,"I know, Phineas, but we're heroes. This is what we do."
4,21,Phineas,"Wait, can we help?"
4,21,Iron Man,Not unless you can fly.
4,21,Phineas,"Well, it's not raining! (Fist bumps Ferb.)"
4,21,The Beak,Bacaw! Woohoo!!
4,21,Red Skull,This should get their attention. (Evil laughter)
4,21,Spider-Man,Looks like somebody left the door open!
4,21,Iron Man,"Alright, gang, it's showtime! Everybody ready?"
4,21,Spider-Man,I feel pretty good.
4,21,Hulk,I'd feel better with a metal suit.
4,21,The Beak,"Sorry, big guy, no time!"
4,21,Iron Man,(pointing up) Look!
4,21,Red Skull,"Ah, ze superheroes are here to save the day. But without your powers, zis is just a costume party. MODOK, destroy them!"
4,21,MODOK,"Yes, I will take great pleasure in destroying these puny heroes!"
4,21,Spider-Man,"I got 'im, guys! Spider-Man smash!"
4,21,Tour Guide,Looking to your left you'll see...
4,21,Spider-Man,Whoooa!!! Whoooooaaa!!
4,21,Hulk,Was he makin' fun of me?
4,21,Thor,"A little, yes."
4,21,Whiplash,They still have their powers!
4,21,Red Skull,"Yes, but they are all mixed up! (He lifts Doofenshmirtz up by his lab coat) Zis your doing!??!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, I don't remember making a Power-Switch-inator, but, ih, y'know, I make a lot of inators!"
4,21,Iron Man,"Y'know, it'd be really nice right now to have the power to throw a hammer!"
4,21,Thor,"I told you it's not about power, it's about worthiness! (sigh) It's like talking to a Bilgesnipe."
4,21,The Beak,Bacaw!
4,21,MODOK,"Hey, what's going on?!"
4,21,Thor,"I find myself in a sticky situation. Oh no, I've received Spider-Man's propensity for puns!"
4,21,Phineas,Now I wish we'd prioritized the waterproofing.
4,21,Hulk,Now I'm Iron Man! (The real Iron Man crashes into the impostor. Spidey finally comes down to Earth crashing on an eyeglass kiosk.)
4,21,Spider-Man,"Okay, that time, I overshot the mark. Oh, hey, Venom. What'd I miss? (Venom grabs Spidey, choking him.)"
4,21,Phineas,"Spider-Man, are you okay?"
4,21,Spider-Man,"Could be worse! At least Iron Man and Thor are... (Cut to MODOK harming Thor.) Well, at least Iron Man..."
4,21,Iron Man,"(tied up in Whiplash's whips) Sorry, gang. A little tied up at the moment."
4,21,Spider-Man,"Okay, nevermind. It couldn't be worse!"
4,21,Stan Lee,"(voiceover) Welcome back, faithful viewers! When last we left our handsome heroes, their fate hung in the balance in a cataclysmic cliffhanger."
4,21,Red Skull,Zis vas all too easy. The time for heroes is over. Now all will bow to us. Und nossing vill save you now.
4,21,Red Skull,(coughing) Stop him!
4,21,Spider-Man,"Hey, Duck Guy, thanks for the rescue! (to Iron Man) Do we tip him?"
4,21,Iron Man,He's not parking our car.
4,21,Spider-Man,I just don't know the etiquette.
4,21,Red Skull,Dah! Who vas that masked...beaver...duck?
4,21,MODOK,MODOK will exterminate all beaver-ducks!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Y'know, none of this would have happened if we had just gone out for ice cream like I suggested!"
4,21,Thor,"(to Agent P) Thank you, small but mighty friend!"
4,21,Phineas,"You know, he seemed vaguely familiar."
4,21,Spider-Man,Ya think that was Howard the Duck?
4,21,Iron Man,"Time is of the essence. We've gotta—No, it wasn't Howard the Duck!"
4,21,Spider-Man,What? I'm just sayin'.
4,21,Hulk,He did have a bill.
4,21,Iron Man,"Anyway, we need to regroup and figure out a plan B."
4,21,Phineas,Right! Back to S.H.E.D.-quarters!
4,21,Phineas,"Hi, guys!"
4,21,Buford,"So, how'd it go?"
4,21,Iron Man,We got our butts handed to us. (to Spidey) How was Venom able to overpower you when you had Hulk's strength?
4,21,Spider-Man,I don't know. I'm...I'm not feeling it anymore.
4,21,Thor,"Wait, let me try something. (runs to the wall and jumps up, but falls down.) I did not stick."
4,21,Phineas,I was afraid of that. The powers are not bonding with your cel structures.
4,21,Iron Man,"Yes, my suit is getting heavier again. But at least having Thor's strength unlocked the joints so I could move."
4,21,Baljeet,"Perhaps we can give you a recharge, but, of course, this time with the correct powers. We have been working on rebuilding the machine."
4,21,Candace,And I'm helping!
4,21,Phineas,(taking off the Beak's torso) You are?
4,21,Candace,I'm redeeming myself.
4,21,Baljeet,"Yes, and we are almost done with the first component."
4,21,Buford,"Hulk's gamma-ray concentration beam. Brawn first, right, big guy?"
4,21,Phineas,That's great!
4,21,Iron Man,So have you done a base level particle acceleration yet?
4,21,Baljeet,I was just about to.
4,21,Iron Man,It's really important to make sure you start with a base level.
4,21,Phineas,"Oh, sure. Otherwise the gamma-rays would..."
4,21,Candace,"Wait, lemme get this for ya. (plugs it in)"
4,21,Phineas,Whoa! Who plugged—
4,21,Baljeet,Uh...oh...
4,21,Hulkjeet,Baljeet smash!! (Smashes the machine to pieces and runs out crashing through the wall running by the Garcia-Shapiro house and jumping off.)
4,21,Candace,Wow. There's something you don't see every— (sees Phineas' über-ticked-off expression) What? What?
4,21,Phineas,"Really, Candace?! Do you have any idea what you just did?!"
4,21,Candace,I was just trying to help.
4,21,Phineas,"Well, your ""help"" this morning messed up so badly, we came this close to being wiped out at the mall! I thought you've learned your lesson!!"
4,21,Candace,But...but I—
4,21,Phineas,"""But"" no! You show up again to help, and now Baljeet has been hulkified and is rampaging who knows where!! And we're back to square one with restoring the heroes' powers!!"
4,21,Candace,But...but—
4,21,Phineas,This is just too important!! And we can't afford any more setbacks!! (Takes off her lanyard) I'm revoking your S.H.E.D. card! (Tears up the card.) You have to go!! NOW!!
4,21,Buford,I've always told her: Don't ever make Phineas angry. You wouldn't like it when he's angry.
4,21,Isabella,Oh no! Baljeet! We've gotta go after him!
4,21,Thor,"Sadly, there is no time! Our mission lies elsewhere!Isabella: Well, I'll go after him then!"
4,21,Buford,"Nah, nah. I'll go! You stay here, little girl, it might get ugly."
4,21,Isabella,What? You don't think I can handle ugly? I've been hangin' out with you all summer!
4,21,Buford,Sticks and stones!
4,21,Nick Fury,"Greetings, Agent P! S.H.I.E.L.D. has gotten intel that the supervillains are holed up in downtown Danville in an oddly-shaped building with its own jingle. We need you to find out what they're up to!"
4,21,Major Monogram,"(now sporting an eyepatch and a goatee like Fury) And neutralize them if possible, Agent P!"
4,21,Nick Fury,"Monogram! Seriously, the beard, too?!"
4,21,Major Monogram,"You're not the only one who can rock an awesome face mullet, Fury!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"(standing in front of an inator) And see, it takes four orbs of mundanium finite to power it. It would only take one orb of Pizzazium Infinionite but that's so hard to find. Oh, don't get me started! So we just lock the module in here and...Viola! Yeah, I know, it's a large violin. I-I don't know why people say that. Anyhoo, what did you guys need a second Power-Drain-inator for?"
4,21,Red Skull,So we won't have to deal vit your idiocy anymore! (Takes out a remote and traps Doof in a cage.)
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, that's not nice! I-I thought we were buds! We were amigos! We had...We had a song and everything!"
4,21,Red Skull,"Your little musical interlude vas a pleasant diwersion at best! You see, ve're not going to take over ze Tri-State Area. We are going to completely destroy it and show vat vill happen if anyone attempts to swart our plan!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Did you just say, ""Swart our plan""?"
4,21,Red Skull,No. Swart! Sw- Vit a T-H! Swart!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, ""thwart""! Yeah, it makes more sense. I think that maybe you should go see a speech pathologist or a-a-a dialect coach or someth—"
4,21,Red Skull,"SILENCE!!! Vunce ve've made our point, we will use our contraption to draw avay ze powers of all ze superheroes on ze planet! And take over ze world!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, you guys really think big!"
4,21,Red Skull,"But first, Venom, squash our little fly on ze ceiling!"
4,21,Red Skull,Now we go and send a little message to our handicapped heroes. Come! Schnell!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,(to Perry) You're not very good at thwarting. I...I should hook you up with my nemesis Perry the Platypus for some pointers. It's an art form for him.
4,21,Hulkjeet,BALJEET SMASH!!!
4,21,Tour Guide,The courtyard also features a statue of Franz the Elephant.
4,21,Isabella,"(sadly) Hey, Candace. What'cha doin'?"
4,21,Candace,Just laying here. Utterly dejected.
4,21,Isabella,"I hear you. None of the women superheroes showed up, so it's all about testosterone and...powers and...fighting, which... (shrugs) yeah."
4,21,Candace,I was only trying to help but all I did was mess things up. (sigh) I'm useless.
4,21,Isabella,I know exactly how you feel.
4,21,(Song,"""Only Trying To Help"")"

4,21,Isabella,"...trying to help, Phineas."
4,21,Lawrence,"Hello, girls. (Wide shot to reveal the ""rain"" is actually the sprinkler.) Don't mind me. I'm just givin' the lawn a bit of a drink. (turns it off) It's off now."
4,21,Buford,"Hey, Baljeet! (Hulkjeet roars and picks Buford up by the shirt.) Heh heh heh...heh...I'm so happy that I found you! I worry about you, you know. Because...you're my best friend."
4,21,Baljeet,"Ah. Thanks, Buford. I did not like being an angry monster."
4,21,Buford,I'm glad. Because you weren't very good at it anyway!!
4,21,Baljeet,Really? I think I was actually quite terrifying.
4,21,Buford,"Oh, come on! You're totally green! (No pun intended.) For example, when you grab somebody's shirt (grabs Baljeet's shirt) and lift 'em up..."
4,21,Baljeet,Hey!
4,21,Buford,...ya gotta twist it first! (demonstrates) And you yell REALLY LOUD!!!
4,21,Hulkjeet,(roars and lifts Buford back up) DO NOT YELL AT BALJEET LIKE THAT!!! (throws Buford and roars and runs)
4,21,Buford,"Okay, the throwin' was good! But when you grabbed my shirt, you didn't twist!! I swear, it's like in one ear and right out de other! Oh, oh! Baljeet, wait up! (goes after him)"
4,21,Red Skull,"Citizens of Danville and ze surrounding Tri-State Area, prepare for your imminent end! Unless Iron Man, Spider-Man, Zor and Hulk show up to face us, we will unleash a device a zousand times vorse zan ze von zat hit zem! (pointing to the device behind him) Thanks to MODOK's modifications, our Power-Drain-inator doesn't merely drain power. It drains energy, matter, everything the target vas! (presses a button) Observe."
4,21,Hot Dog Vendor,"Aw, man! And I just moved here from New York, cuz I thought it would be safer!"
4,21,Phineas,"Uh, guys, you better come see this."
4,21,Red Skull,"So, heroes, eizer you come down here and face us, or ve vill unleash zis veapon on ze entire Tri-State Area! (Laughs evilly)"
4,21,Thor,Ah! The fiend!
4,21,Spider-Man,"I actually missed a lot of that with the accent, but I got that it's bad."
4,21,Phineas,"Oh, man. What're we gonna do?"
4,21,Thor,What we have to.
4,21,Phineas,But you have no powers.
4,21,Iron Man,That doesn't matter. We've gotta fight back with whatever we've got left.
4,21,Thor,Being a hero isn't the armor you wear. But the metal in your spirit and the steel in your resolve.
4,21,Spider-Man,"Man, that was eloquent. All I ever do is quips. Like this one, for instance. And the one preceding it."
4,21,Iron Man,Can we please not kill the gravitas of this moment?
4,21,Spider-Man,Sorry.
4,21,Phineas,Man! We've got a lot to do if we're gonna get this suit back online. I think we can get 60% function back if we reroute the power flow through the backup circuits.
4,21,Candace,"Maybe if I just go in and apologize one more time they'll forgive me. I have a stomachache, I feel so bad."
4,21,Isabella,They're your brothers. They'll listen.
4,21,Candace,"Phineas, look, I'm sorry."
4,21,Phineas,How did you get in? I thought I revoked your S.H.E.D. ID.
4,21,Candace,Isabella gave me her guest pass.
4,21,Phineas,"Fine, but...don't touch anything."
4,21,Candace,"Ferb, you've gotta listen to me!"
4,21,Phineas,"(to Ferb) The shoulder joint's ready. (climbing down the ladder) Excuse me, Candace."
4,21,Candace,"Phineas, can't you stop and listen?"
4,21,Phineas,"Candace, you don't understand! The guys are in trouble! If we can't get downtown to help them, this may be their final battle!"
4,21,Whiplash,The heroes are not coming!
4,21,Red Skull,"Oh, don't worry. They'll come."
4,21,MODOK,My sensors tell me the heroes are approaching.
4,21,Red Skull,Perfect! Zey're on ze bus!
4,21,Little Old Lady,"Outta my way, you weirdos! It's worse than Portland!"
4,21,Spider-Man,"A mindball? Really? Hey, MODOK, can you feel it in your brain when I go like this? (rubs his hands against the ball)"
4,21,Red Skull,Ve have zem now!
4,21,Whiplash,What about old lady?
4,21,Red Skull,"Eh? Oh, she is not—She is not vis zem!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) So you're a superhero, huh? Don't you have some sort of power to get us out of this? (Perry pushes a button on his utility belt) Hey...Oh, wow! You've got...super wire cutters, huh? Oh, what are they, nail clippers that got bitten by radioactive pinching shears?"
4,21,Phineas,(sitting in the Beak suit) We've only got half the server motors on the right side online.
4,21,Candace,"This isn't funny, guys! You can't go! It's not safe!"
4,21,Isabella,Phineas!
4,21,Phineas,"Don't worry, Isabella. Initiate launching sequence, Ferb. (The rocket jets appear from the butt, but one goes back in.)"
4,21,Isabella,"Phineas, you've only got one butt jet!"
4,21,Phineas,"Well, that'll have to do. Bacaw! (launches)"
4,21,Candace,Phineas!
4,21,The Beak,(flying all willy-nilly) Whoa! Whoa!

4,21,Hulkjeet,Hulkjeet.
4,21,Iron Man,"Oh, my bad. Apparently he prefers to be known as ""Hulkjeet"". (The Beak arrives.) And this thing."
4,21,The Beak,Bacaw!
4,21,Iron Man,"If it's a bird, it's with us, too. (Agent P flies in) The flying duck with a beaver tail. We got him! (Waffles fall from the sky) But I gotta level with ya, I have no idea who's shooting waffles."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Woo-hoo! Top of the world, Ma!"
4,21,Spider-Man,"Yo, Red, (holding the orbs) is this doohickey important?"
4,21,Red Skull,Ze mundanium finite reactor core!
4,21,Spider-Man,Huh. I guess it is important. (runs off)
4,21,Red Skull,Go get him! I shall guard ze inator! (gets waffled)
4,21,Spider-Man,"Thanks, Baljeet!"
4,21,Hulkjeet,Hulkjeet!
4,21,The Beak,Bacaw!
4,21,Spider-Man,Woo!
4,21,Candace,"(pacing back and forth) There's one thing I don't understand about the lost superpowers. In all the comics I've read, energy can never be destroyed. Only morphed into a different form or contained somehow."
4,21,Isabella,"Candace, when we were up at the space station, we were collecting and containing data!"
4,21,Candace,You were up in what?
4,21,Isabella,Come on!
4,21,Isabella,Have a seat.
4,21,Candace,What are you talking about?
4,21,Isabella,Just go with it.
4,21,Candace,"Oh, that's where this thing was!"
4,21,Spider-Man,Fast cart!
4,21,Iron Man,"Yeah, I souped it up!"
4,21,Spider-Man,"(gives Iron Man the reactor core) Here! Hold this! (goes to the back and gets the caddy bag) You mind if I play through? (Unzips the front pocket emptying it of all the tees. Whiplash slips on the tees. Spidey gets out a club with dog-shaped cover on it and throws the caddy bag at Venom.) Go get 'im, boy! (Throws the club at MODOK.) Good dog!"
4,21,Bear Boy,Beware Bear Boy! (slaps the fish at Red Skull)
4,21,Hulk,Now you kids stay back! Hmm?
4,21,Candace,You don't think it's weird the space station looks like Phineas?
4,21,Isabella,"If by ""weird"" you mean ""dreamy""."
4,21,Candace,"Oh, brother."
4,21,Isabella,Look! The collection tank! There's something glowing in there! It's gotta be the powers!
4,21,Candace,(looking through a telescope) Looks like the fight's begun! Now make the powers blast out...down there and stuff.
4,21,Isabella,I don't know how to do that!
4,21,Candace,Whadaya mean? Didn't Phineas explain how to—
4,21,Isabella,"Yeah. It was like, ""Isabella...blah blah blah blah blah...Isabella...blah blah blah blah blah..."" He was dressed like an astronaut! I was distracted!"
4,21,Red Skull,Ze mundanium finite! (to Venom) Get zose orbs!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, these waffles aren't enough. I...I wish I could just disintegrate them all. (gasp) Oh, right! The Disintegrator-inator! Duh! (switches it on, nothing happens) I don't know what I was—Hey! (flips the switch up and down) Hey, what's wrong? Hmmm. (picks up the unplugged plug) Oh, here's the problem. (He walks up to an extension cord outlet, but the plug is too short.) Okay, I just need an extension cord this long. (Runs off.)"
4,21,Candace,"Isabella, (points to a big red button) I think this is the button that'll release the superpowers!"
4,21,Isabella,How can you tell?
4,21,Candace,"Well, it's red, see? And there's some red detailing on that collector thing, so it's gotta be it."
4,21,Isabella,That's a very irrational and reckless deduction.
4,21,Candace,"No, Isabella! I've failed twice already so the third time's a charm!"
4,21,Computer,System shutting down.
4,21,Candace,Uh-oh.
4,21,Computer,Anti-gravitational jets disabled.
4,21,Isabella,Candace!
4,21,Computer,Orbit decaying.
4,21,Candace,We're falling back to Earth!
4,21,Computer,Fuel systems immobilized. Social network friends...defriended.
4,21,Candace,"Oh, now that's just mean!"
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, this long. This long, lessee. (gets out a few extension cords) Too short. Too short. Too long. Way too short! Why would I even have this?!"
4,21,Tour Guide,"If you look to your left, you will see the J.P. McHenry Building, built in the art deco style. (Behind her, the battle still rages on.) And on your right is Danville's oldest arcade, built in 1982."
4,21,The Beak,Talk about being disarmed.
4,21,The Beak,That's not good.
4,21,Hulk,Hey! Over here!
4,21,Red Skull,"Enough of zis foolishness! (Places the reactor core back into the inator) Our triumph is at hand! (The inator activates.) And now, behold, ze destruction of ze entire Tri-State—"
4,21,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, is that our space station?"
4,21,Candace,"Yo, heroes, got a little somethin' for ya! (rolls down the tank)"
4,21,Phineas,Candace! The data collection tank! Of course!
4,21,Spider-Man,Great job! Somebody's using their spider sense.
4,21,Candace,"I learned from the best, Spidey!"
4,21,Red Skull,"Get up! Get zem, you fools!!"
4,21,(Song,"""Feelin' Super"")"
4,21,Thor,Hmm.
4,21,Thor,"(shakes the tickets off to reveal a parking boot on the hammer) Oh, for crying out loud! (He tears the boot off and reaches the hammer out. Candace smiles and touches Mjolnir and giggles giddily.)"
4,21,Candace,Hee-hee-hee-hee!
4,21,Red Skull,(growls) I zink perhaps our window of opportunity has closed.
4,21,Phineas,"Well, Iron Man, looks like you're functioning at full capacity."
4,21,Iron Man,Yep. Why don't you kids take five? Enjoy the show.
4,21,Ferb,"Oh, this is going to be sweet."
4,21,Phineas,Yeah it is!
4,21,(Song,"""Feeling Froggy"")"
4,21,Buford,Better?
4,21,Phineas,"Hey, Hulk, that's using my head!"
4,21,Baljeet,Nice!
4,21,Phineas,(high fives Ferb) Wordplay!
4,21,Candace,Huh? Thor!
4,21,Phineas,(to Candace) Hey.
4,21,Candace,Hey.
4,21,Phineas,"So earlier, I really lost it. Uh, I'm sorry."
4,21,Candace,"No, I'm sorry. I deserved it. Everything I did made things worse."
4,21,Phineas,It's okay. You were trying to help. And hello! You guys saved the day!
4,21,Candace,Thanks!
4,21,Phineas,(taking out the repaired S.H.E.D. ID) So will you take your S.H.E.D. membership card back? I fixed it.
4,21,Candace,(takes it) I accept.
4,21,Candace,"What? (she sees her mother walking by the wreckage) Is that Mom? You know I love you guys and I'm super glad we made up, but would you look at this place? Sorry, but you are SO BUSTED!! Mom! (And there she goes again.)"
4,21,Nick Fury,"Toss 'em in! Nice work, kids! You didn't just get back our heroes' powers. You showed true courage fighting alongside them!  (renders a hand salute) S.H.I.E.L.D. owes you a debt of gratitude. (Phineas and Ferb return the salute.)"
4,21,Hot Dog Vendor,"Yeah! Hot dogs for everyone, baby!"
4,21,Tour Guide,Three years later when the new day care center was built on top of the ancient burial ground...
4,21,Candace,Mom! Mom Mom Mom! You gotta come back to the square!! The boys' space satellite crashed down to Earth and these villains had a machine that would destroy the Tri-State Area and there's superheroes!! All in the square!! You gotta see it!
4,21,Linda,I'm surprised that's not on the tour.
4,21,Candace,"No time for sarcasm, Mom! (grabs her) Come on!!"
4,21,Iron Man,"Here's my direct line, Ferb. Internship, next summer? It'll be fun."
4,21,Spider-Man,"Next time, Phin, the juice box'll be my treat. (web slings away)"
4,21,Phineas,"You got it, Spidey!"
4,21,Baljeet,"Uh, okay. (fist bumps Hulk)"
4,21,Hulk,Ow! Hmm. Ha ha! Gotcha!
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Ih. Finally found an extension cord the right size! (plugs in the inator) Take that, bad guys! (The inator zaps the space station away and Candace appears just as it disappears.)"
4,21,Candace,...giant head shaped like Phineas and superheroes! But...but...but...
4,21,Linda,"Oh, yes. There they are. (zoom out to reveal a comic book stand full of Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man and Ducky Momo comics)"
4,21,Candace,Wha?
4,21,Linda,"Hulk, Iron Man, Thor. All of them. I forgot you had a thing for comic books."
4,21,Candace,"But but...This isn't how..Wait, where did..."
4,21,Linda,You wanna join me for the rest of the tour?
4,21,Candace,"No, I'd rather stay here and sulk."
4,21,Doofenshmirtz,I did it! Did anyone see that? Anyone? Anyone? No one's lookin'. Nobody's payin' attention.
4,21,Phineas,Hey! There goes that unknown superhero! (The gang approach Agent P.) You were pretty awesome out there!
4,21,Buford,"Yeah, and what's your secret identity?"
4,21,Phineas,"Buford, a hero never reveals their secret identity."
4,21,Buford,Sure they do! Watch!
4,21,(Buford takes the mask off to reveal,)
4,21,Everyone,Ducky Momo?!?
4,21,Candace,Ducky Momo?!?! (sighs and faints into Isabella's arms)
4,21,Ferb,That's strange. I was convinced that he was an anthropomorphic platypus. Huh. What with the beaver tail and all.
4,21,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry! You missed all the fun!"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"No, No, No! I've been good! Don't put me in your gundersack! Not the gundersack! Ahhhhhhhhh! The Kinderlumper!"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,That's it! Der Kinderlumper!
4,6,Candace,"So, what do you think?"
4,6,Stacy,"I think you look like you just fell off a turnip truck, and then got run over by a rutabaga truck."
4,6,Candace,"Yeah yeah, real funny. This is the official rutabaga regalia for the 100th Running of the Chinchillas from Danville to Badger Town. By wearing this it will entice the chinchillas to follow me the Princess!"
4,6,Stacy,"So yeah, I get it. It's a huge honor and everything. But come on Candace, why do you really want to be Rutabaga Princess?"
4,6,Candace,I get to start the Running of the Chinchillas!
4,6,Stacy,Yeah...
4,6,Candace,"Mom, Dad, and everyone in Danville will be waiting in Badger Town to see me cross the finish line!"
4,6,Stacy,Yeah...
4,6,Candace,I get to be on TV!
4,6,Stacy,That's the reason!
4,6,Candace,"Stacy, this is my first step on my way to stardom and as my best friend, you'll be famous by association."
4,6,Stacy,That's my favorite kind of famous!
4,6,Phineas,(Off-screen.) Candace!
4,6,Candace,"What is it, Phineas?"
4,6,Phineas,Look at the cool vehicles we made for you for the Running of the Chinchillas! Baljeet has grown a new super street of bio engineer rutabaga!
4,6,Baljeet,I simply spliced the genetic code of a rutabaga and a giant redwood.
4,6,Buford,Aaaaannnnd?
4,6,Baljeet,And fennel.
4,6,Buford,I want it to smell like licorice!
4,6,Candace,"You're not getting me into one of those things! I'm not showin' up for my TV debut lookin' like a complete weirdo! (to Stacy) What? I said, ""Complete"". (to the gang) And now, I must leave. My public awaits."
4,6,Stacy,"Yeah, and I must go be famous by association."
4,6,Phineas,"And to think, we knew Stacy before she was famous by association."
4,6,Linda,Dah! I'm supposed to be in Badgertown! (she runs off leaving the still-on vacuum behind her. We hear an inexplicable cat scream in the background.)
4,6,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. I was just doing a little handicapping for this year's Running of the Chinchillas. Think I'm going to box Dryer's Dust with Squeaky Toy."
4,6,Carl,(also holding a racing forum and a pen) And I'm taking Gerbil Bait to win.
4,6,Major Monogram,"You're daft, Carl! (to Perry) Anyway, rumor has it that Doofenshmirtz plans to attend the ceremony. Odds are he's up to something evil. Better look into it, Agent P. (Perry zips away) Hmmm...Gerbil Bait. Heh, talk about your long shots. (He looks to his right) Dangit, Carl!"
4,6,Reporter,"Good morning, everyone. I'm Mike van Hatofapilgrim here in Danville for the 100th Annual Running of the Chinchillas, (walking up to Candace and Stacy) and with us today is this year's Rutabaga Princess. And what's your name, young lady?"
4,6,Candace,I'm Candace Flynn.
4,6,Stacy,(pushing Candace aside) And I'm famous by association!
4,6,Mike,"That's great. (to the camera) Well, there ya have it. A good day for rutabagas, chinchillas, and self-promoting sycophantism."
4,6,Candace,"Ahem. Citizens of Danville, it is now time for your princess....me....to start the Running of the Chinchillas! I now summon my tuber troubadour!"
4,6,Irving,"I will now play the traditional chinchilla fanfare. (He takes a deep breath and plays a very out of tune fanfare. He inhales again, while Candace swipes the horn away revealing he's simply musically exhaling.) What? But—Huh? (Candace throws the horn away.) I see. Not a music lover. (He holds up a purple pillow with a rutabaga on it) My Princess?"
4,6,Candace,"I will now take a bite of the ceremonial rutabaga. (She sinks her teeth into the rutabaga, but then promptly spits it into her other hand.)"
4,6,Irving,And now I most humbly take my leave. (He leaves) Princess.
4,6,Candace,"You do that, Sputnik. Chinchillas, let the running begin!"

4,6,Cameraman,There's no one in the studio. It's Sunday.
4,6,Mike,Really? How'm I supposed to do a live broadcast when no one is in the studio?
4,6,Cameraman,We're not live. We're taping this.
4,6,Mike,(sighs) Fine.
4,6,Stacy,"Candace, here, let me get your train. (Holds onto Candace's cape, then hears a loud squeak) Oh, omigosh, sorry!"
4,6,Candace,"I don't know, Stacy. This is harder than I thought. (another loud squeak) Oh, sorry!"
4,6,Stacy,"Maybe if we ran in front of them, it'd be a little easier."
4,6,Candace,"Okay, now onward to Badgertown!"
4,6,Stacy,"Oh, omigosh, sorry!"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"That should do it. (Perry emerges from the black hole while Doof's butt flap goes down.) Excellent. (turns around) Perry the Platypus? (looks at his butt flap) Oh. (he buttons it) Sorry you had to see that. It's just that...this one button. Anyway, you are just in time to witness as I activate the Kinderlumperinator and transform myself into a real live Kinderlumper! (Perry looks at Doofenshmirtz confused) What? Don't tell me you've never heard of the Kinderlumper. (Perry simply shrugs) Y'know...uh...gigantic troll with sharp teeth and nose like a broom handle, he grabs children, puts 'em in a gundersack if they...You never heard of this? My mother used to sing me this lovely song about it right before I went to bed. And it goes a little something like this. (He claps his hands twice. The lights go out. He claps twice again to reveal he is now dressed like Cab Calloway in front of a jazz band and does some of Cabby's signature walks.)"

4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"So anyway, I got this actual-sized Kinderlumper costume (climbing inside the suit) and I'm gonna shoot myself with the Kinderlumperinator to make me gigantic and trollish so, ya know, it will fit. Then I will go to scare my brother, Roger, so badly that he is certain to relinquish control of the Tri-State Area to me! Well, to the Kinderlumper, actually, but when the ray wears off, I'll be me again and I'll already be in control. Stand back, Perry the Platypus. Prepare to do some beholding! (He claps twice again, activating the Kinderlumperinator. Perry jumps up to him) Oh! Knock it off, you crazy platy— (The inator zaps both of them, transforming Doofenshmirtz into an exact likeness of the Kinderlumper, while Perry transforms into a rather giant hairy bearded platypus-type monster) It worked! Hee hee hee hee hee hee! (He claps twice accidentally activating the inator again, which shoots through the black hole and out the building.)"
4,6,Candace,"Y'know, Stacy? This is fun. I could get used to this princess thing. (The blue ray zaps all of the chinchillas making them into giant beasts. Stacy screams first followed by Candace. They flee past a news van. The chinchilla beasts follow them, tipping the van over. Mike and the cameraman open the doors and emerge from the van.)"
4,6,Mike,Did you see that? Call in Chopper 4! This is the biggest story of my career! (He jumps out of the van) Let's get some!
4,6,Cameraman,"Oh, why did I ever opt for work release?"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously, Perry the Platypus, is it really necessary to destroy everything? (Perry jumps off the destroyed inator and chatters. Doofenshmirtz backs away leading Perry onto a giant black ""X"" in the middle of the room) N-nn-n-n-now, now, that's a good trollish gigantic platypus. (Doofenshmirtz claps twice activating a giant cage that drops on Perry) Ha! Let that be a lesson to you: Never stand on a big cartoony ""X""! And now, I've a little appointment to keep with the mayor. (Doof exits laughing. Perry chatters)"

4,6,Roger,I think I know this guy. There's nothing to be afraid of! It's only the Kinderlumper come to join our celebration! Ha-ha! Now it's a party!
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"I, uh, I believe the more appropriate response would be to flee in terror."
4,6,Roger,"But, Kinderlumper, why would I ever run away from you?"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,Don't you remember the Kinderlumper song?
4,6,Roger,Remember? Of course I remember! Bubbe used to sing me the song every night.
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,"N-n-no, wait! Those are not the words!!!"
4,6,Roger,"Well, that's how she sang it to me. And I still have some of the gifts you brought me. (He takes out a box of almond brittle.) Look! Almond brittle!"
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,NO!!! But—But you don't even like almond brittle!
4,6,Roger,I know. (puts the box back in his jacket) That's why I never ate it.
4,6,Doofenshmirtz,(sobbing) Nooo-ho-ho....

4,7,Major Monogram,"Agent P. Doofenshmirtz was last seen boarding a train transporting Precious Albert the Moose. Cue the graphic Carl. (A picture of Albert the Moose appears) Albert the Moose is Canada's prized animal, who represents the unity of the provinces. We need you to make sure Doof keeps his mitts off that moose. If you fail, Canada Day Celebrations will be ruined, (The picture of Albert the Moose disappears, except for the antlers) and Canada will break into civil war. Or, since it's Canada, it would be a civil conversation where secession would be topic of discussion, and... (Monogram notices the moose antlers) Carl? Antlers?"

4,7,Major Monogram,"Now this train runs along the border between the United States and Canada, so you only have jurisdiction on the American side of the train. To help you out on the Canadian side of the train You'll be teaming up with an Agent from C.O.W.C.A. the Canadian Organization Without a Cool Acronym, Agent Lyla. (A picture of the woman from Perry's previous mission is shown) You may remember her from that special assignment for our Seattle Bureau we sent you on a couple of months ago. I know that didn't go too well but I expect you to be professional, and put that all behind you. Get out there and good luck. (Perry leaves in his hover jet) Carl?

4,7,Lyla,Oh shoot! I see we're trapped by societal convention.

4,7,Lyla,"Oh, come on, he's warming up to the idea."
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,Yes obviously.
4,7,Lyla,"Why are you causing trouble in Canada, Doofenshmirtz?"
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you see, I'm part of a U.S., Canada, evil scheme exchange program. I come up with a scheme, This other Canadian guy comes up with a scheme, and we switch. I do his scheme and he does mine."
4,7,Lyla,You gonna eat those fries?
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't touch! Anyway I've got a little math quiz for the both of you. If a train carrying Precious Albert the Moose left British Columbia at eight o'clock in the morning, going eighty mile per hour, what time would it arrive at the Canada Day celebration? Answer? Never! Because I've tied up the conductor, and taken control of the train using my remote control Train-Operator-inator! Right now we are all headed to my scheme exchange partner's secret fortress.

4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously, leave my lunch alone. Anyway, after Professor Banister gets the moose, it's going to ruin Canada Day, or you know, whatever. Crazy, right?"

4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"I am not kidding, leave those alone. I just don't understand it, why do you take my lunch, when you're in the dining car you can have you're own lunch. Oh it makes me crazy when people pick at my food. (Lyla winks at Perry, and Perry understands) Seriously, why is your hand out like that? I am seriously going to lose it. (Perry takes a fry) Aw, now you're both doing it!? Stop it! Stop it! Ahh! Oh no, even taking them but just squishing them! I can't take it.

4,7,Banister,"It's Swedish for ""goodbye"". It's one of the languages we speak in Greenla--"
4,7,Bannister,Jinx you Lyla Lolliberry. Jinx you!
4,7,Lyla,"Way to text in the cavalry. Okay, let's get this bird off to Canada day. We have a guest of honor to deliver."
4,7,Man,"Go Canada! Go, eh?"
4,7,Man 2,Way to go Constitution Act of 1864!
4,7,Man,Right on!
4,7,Man 2,WooOoo!
4,7,Lyla,"So now you see why I had to let those guys go, right P.?"
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,Well how was he supposed to know you had a tracker on their truck?
4,7,Lyla,He understands how these things are. One minute your catching a thief the next you get intel they might be leading you somewhere bigger and better.
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, and by ""bigger and better"" you obviously mean me! Right? Right?"
4,7,Lyla,"Yeah, right. Anyway. You've got some serious skills there P."
4,7,Lyla,"Stop, you're making me blush."
4,7,Monogram,Good work to the both of you. I can see things went well with our neighbors to the North.
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,Well now that our mission is done--
4,7,Lyla,Our mission?
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,"...maybe we could drop by Niagara Falls. It's so close by, and I've always wanted to see it."
4,7,Monogram,Well I suppose we could swing by on our way back.
4,7,Doofenshmirtz,I wonder how my scheme worked out for Professor Banister. I'm sure that Cloud Magnitizer-inator was a winner.
4,7,Candace,Mom! Mom! Mom! Hey Perry.(Bends down to pets him) Mom! Mom! Mom!
4,7,Phineas,How was it that a cloud was able to carry off our metal superstructure?
4,7,Candace,"But, but, but..."
4,7,Linda,"Someone's got a bathroom to clean. Everyone else, there's pie."
4,7,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
4,7,Ferb,"Ah, a platypus's life is a life of leisure."
4,7,Phineas,"Yes, yes it is."
4,7,Monogram,"We'd like to apologize on behalf of the show, for poking a little fun at Greenland. The Greenland flag is actually verifiable cool. It was designed by Thue Christiansen as part of a flag designing contest in the 80's... Is this actually true, Carl?"
4,7,Carl,"According to the internet, sir."
4,7,Monogram,"Well, what do you know? Also we understand that the people of Greenland do have enormous national pride, and are not necessarily short. This was all purely in the interest of comedy, and not meant to be taken seriously. Go Greenland!"
4,20,Phineas,"Ferb, we've got a lot of leftover parts from the last time we used leftover parts. There must be something we can do with them, you know, besides hodgepodges or art pieces."
4,20,Buford,"Whoa, dudes, what's with all the junk in your backyard? It's like an obstacle course back here!"
4,20,Phineas,That's it! I know what we're gonna do today!
4,20,Buford,What'd I say?
4,20,Phineas,"You said obstacle course, of course!"
4,20,Buford,"Oh, I meant to say chili cook off."
4,20,Baljeet,Are you meaning to tell me we have never made an obstacle course this entire summer?
4,20,Phineas,Ferb?
4,20,Ferb,I'm filled with remorse
4,20,Phineas,Then let's build one and make it our new tour de force!
4,20,Ferb,That is a plan I can clearly endorse.
4,20,Phineas,Of course!
4,20,Baljeet,Of course!
4,20,Phineas,Of course!
4,20,Buford,Of course! I'm puttin' an end to this before it breaks into song! Where's Perry??
4,20,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. There are pretty suspicious goings-on...going on at the Doofenshmirtz building. We have reports that the building has been rotating all morning, so either he's got something evil up his sleeve, or he's turning it into an expensive romantic restaurant with an impressive view...in which case, I would like a reservation for 6:00 pm. Either way, I'm gonna need you to get over there. (Perry leaves. Monogram looks aside.) Okay, he's gone. One, a-two, a-one-two-three. (Puts on a Major-General's hat and several agents appear and he sings to the tune of ""The Major-General's Song"" from The Pirates of Penzance.)"
4,20,Candace,"Wow, Gluttony Games is totally bloated with mindless mayhem! And the two girls, they were so brave and fearless!"
4,20,Stacy,"We would make an awesome team, you and me!"
4,20,Candace,"(high fives Stacy) You and me, baby! Of course, we'd have to learn to shoot a bow and arrow, and build a rope bridge..."
4,20,Candace,"...and catch two leaves between two pieces of wax paper and choose matching backpacks and sharpen a hatchet, (opening the gate) and we'll live on nothing but—"
4,20,Candace and Stacy,Holy cannoli!
4,20,Candace,What in the world is going on here?! PHINEAS AND FERB!!!!
4,20,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, babies and slightly smaller babies, welcome to the Phineas and Ferb Ultimate Obstacle Course! The first team that makes it all the way to the end (you know, alive and stuff) will win this nifty trophy! So are you ready to get muddy?"
4,20,Candace,That tears it! Those two are so—
4,20,Stacy,"Hang on, Candace! We can win this!"
4,20,Candace,"Yeah, we ca— Wait, what?"
4,20,Stacy,I want that trophy!
4,20,Candace,Why?
4,20,Dr. Hirano,"Very good, Ginger. We'll put it up here with the rest of your awards. I'm...still saving a place for your trophy, Stacy. You know, just in case."
4,20,Stacy,Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
4,20,Stacy,"...hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... Candace, we'd make an awesome team!"
4,20,Candace,"Alright, I'll do it!"
4,20,Stacy,For the trophy!
4,20,Candace,And for whatever it was you were thinking about just now.
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm, I wonder who that could be. (opens the door and gasps) Perry the Platypus? Well, come on in. Wipe your feet if you don't mind. I just mopped the floor. (Perry steps onto the welcome mat, which traps him.) Ha ha! Gotcha! That's what you get for having manners! Hee hee hee! Now, I bet you're wondering why my building has been turning 90 degrees every now and then. Well, that's because I was just testing out my 90-Degree-Turn-inator!! Eh, you like it? Y'know, it turns things. But only 90 degrees at a time. You see, back in Drusselste—y'know what? Just watch this documentary."
4,20,Newsreader,"This Week in History! Dateline: 1602. The mayors of Gimmelshtump and Stumblegimp prepare to sign a treaty declaring they are sister cities. However, while reaching for his quill, the Mayor of Gimmelshtump accidentally turned 90 degrees. Since showing your side to another is considered a Stumblegimpian insult, the Mayor of Stumblegimp was forced to follow tradition. (The Mayor of Stumblegimp takes off his shoe and sock and slaps it in the Mayor of Gimmelshtump's face.) And so, war was declared. Gimmelshtump had no choice but to retaliate. The war escalated and raged on for 50 years. Finally, the only way to end this senseless feud was for the Mayor of Gimmelshtump to perform the Stumblegimpian humiliating Dance of Contrition."
4,20,(Song,"""Humiliating Stumblegimp Dance of Contrition"")"
4,20,Newsreader,"And so, the Mayor of Stumblegimp was appeased. And, once again, all was right between the two cities...or was it? The End!"
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"And the Stumblegimp Humiliating Dance of Contrition is just as much a tradition now as it was in the '40s...when this newsreel was made about the 1600s. You see, Perry the Platypus, my brother, the Mayor's gonna meet the present day Mayor of Stumblegimp. And I plan to zap Roger with my 90-Degree-Turn-inator. It will turn him 90 degrees, which will insult Mayor...uh...Whatshisname. Something with waffles. He'll have to sing that whole song, and when the people of Danville see him eat a featherbed or put a donut in his pants, he'll be forced to step down as mayor and I will step into his place, 100% donut-pant-free! Unless, you know, something like last week happens again."
4,20,Phineas,"And finally, our third team, Candace and Stacy!"
4,20,Candace,We are so ready!
4,20,Isabella,What was that about?
4,20,Ginger,"Oh, that's our secret code for ""I love you, sis""...I think."
4,20,Phineas,"Good luck, contestants! And watch out for giant worms! On your marks..."
4,20,Candace,"Wait, what?"
4,20,Phineas,Get set...
4,20,Candace,"Did he say, ""Giant worms""?"
4,20,Phineas,Go!
4,20,Buford,Aaaah! Giant worm!!!
4,20,Phineas,"Well, it looks like Buford and Baljeet are out of the race. Sorry, guys. You know what they say: Giant worms can do whatever they want."
4,20,Phineas,"Both remaining teams have made it to the beach! Nice job, ladies, but you may wanna get to cover."
4,20,Candace,Cover?
4,20,Phineas,(activating a water balloon launcher) Fire!
4,20,Isabella,Incoming!
4,20,Stacy,Water balloons!
4,20,Phineas,Just look at them go!
4,20,Stacy,Get off the beach! Get off the beach!!
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, yes! The horse-drawn coach has arrived and Mayor...Wafflesomething is walking up to Roger."
4,20,Roger,"Heheh, Mayor Chickenen, it is so good to finally meet you."
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Chicken and waffles! That's why I had ""waffles"" stuck in my head. That was it. (walks up to the inator) And...now! (fires the inator)"
4,20,Roger,(holding out his hand) It is indeed a rare pleasure to— (He gets zapped and rotates 90 degrees east.)
4,20,Mayor Chickenen,Huh? What is the meaning of this? I will have to declare war now!
4,20,Roger,Maybe not. Pstt!
4,20,Melanie,What happened?
4,20,Roger,Get the Dance of Contrition team out here pronto!
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, baby! It worked! And now for the humiliatioooonnnn!"
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, th-th-th-that's not the Stumblegimp Humiliating Dance of Contrition! (he lowers his hands to reveal there's nothing in them and sighs) One day, I gotta ask Norm what he did with my binoculars."
4,20,Phineas,It looks like Isabella and Ginger are way out front!
4,20,Candace,"Hurry, Stace! They're getting away!"
4,20,Phineas,"Watch your step, ladies! That's mud down there! Baljeet's suggestion!"
4,20,Buford,Really?
4,20,Baljeet,I knew we would not make it that far.
4,20,Buford,"Well, not with an attitude like that!"
4,20,Candace,"We'll see who gets mud in his face, Smart Guy! (She starts to step on a platform, but it moves and she falls downs screaming and lands with a splat.)"
4,20,Phineas,Good thing mud's good for the skin!
4,20,Candace,Blehhhhh...
4,20,Phineas,"(next to a giant fan) Let's dry 'em off, Ferb!"
4,20,Isabella,"Hold on to something, Ginger! We're almost there!"
4,20,Candace,"Hey, he's right, my skin feels so soft. Come on, Stace!"
4,20,Phineas,Whoa! Nice hang time!
4,20,Isabella,I regret nothing!
4,20,Candace,That puts us in the lead! Woohoo! (A pie flies into her face.) Pie? Really?
4,20,Phineas,And Isabella and Ginger take the lead!
4,20,Mayor Chickenen,Wonderful! The new improved Dance of Contrition always makes me want to shake a leg!
4,20,Roger,Fantastic.
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,Whoa whoa whoa! That was not nearly humiliating enough! Where was the part about bowing and pulling your shirt up over your face and juggling piglets? Where were the piglets?!
4,20,Mayor Chickenen,"Oh, we haven't done that since the '40s when we made that newsreel about the 1600s. Things have changed. (He hums and dances.)"
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,So what's your point?
4,20,Phineas,"We're nearing the finish line, and here comes Team Ginger and Isabella, with Candace and Stacy in hot pursuit! And now, ladies, who's up for some popcorn?"
4,20,Candace,We're the last ones standing!
4,20,Candace and Stacy,Yay!
4,20,Stacy,Woohoo!
4,20,Phineas,"Candace and Stacy win! (A giant gorilla hand appears out of nowhere and slaps them off the log.) Sorry. Forgot about the giant gorilla hand. My bad. Remember, everyone's a winner, but only one team gets a trophy!"
4,20,Candace,"Stacy, we won!"
4,20,Ginger,"Congratulations, Stacy!"
4,20,Stacy,Ha! Now I'm like you! I have a trophy!
4,20,Ginger,"But, Stacy, I won all those trophies just trying to impress you."
4,20,Stacy,Really?
4,20,Ginger,Yeah! You're the coolest big sister a girl could ever have! How can I compete?
4,20,Stacy,"Well, I am pretty cool."
4,20,Buford,I'll take that! Giant worms can do whatever they want! (They disappear.)
4,20,Candace,"(stands up) That does it, it's busting time!"
4,20,Candace,(in a stern voice) Mother? May I please speak with you?
4,20,Linda,"(flatly) Oh, boy..."
4,20,Mayor Chickenen,"Oh, how rude! (Takes off his shoe and sock and slaps the sock onto Doofenshmirtz.)"
4,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, give it a rest! (grunts) I must've left it in random fire mode."
4,20,Pilot,"Uh, welcome to Flight J2261 to New York. (The ray bounces off the plane, which rotates 90 degrees.) Uh, hey, who wants to go to Alabama?"
4,20,Candace,Mom! (closes eyes) Take a look outside the window!
4,20,Linda,"Candace, what's gotten into you?"
4,20,Candace,Look!!!
4,20,Linda,"(turns around and sees the image of Phineas and Ferb under the tree outside) Hi, boys!"
4,20,Candace,(her eyes open) What...? (looks out the window) But-but -- !
4,20,Linda,"Really, Candace? This is getting old. (walks away)"
4,20,Candace,But....but......but....
4,34,Candace,"Hi, Mom. Stacy and I are gonna have lunch here at the mall so we'll be hanging out a little longer. (Stacy shows a ferret headband to Candace as she gives Stacy a thumbs up)"
4,34,Linda,I thought you probably would.
4,34,Candace,(voiceover) Are the boys doing anything bustable yet?
4,34,Linda,Not yet. Although they are trying to figure out how they can both use the push broom at the same time.
4,34,Candace,"OK, keep me posted. (hangs up)"
4,34,(Phineas and Ferb are seen using the push broom,Phineas pushing the broom while Ferb guides him by standing on the broom and pointing straight.)
4,34,Phineas,"Hey, Mom. We're going down to the park to fly our kites."
4,34,Linda,You guys wanna ride or something?
4,34,Phineas,I thought you had to meet with those landscaper guys.
4,34,Linda,"Oh right, I forgot. (reads leaflet) Du Bois (Du-bwa) Landscape Artists."
4,34,Phineas,"Also, that's yesterday's paper."
4,34,Linda,I thought the city council was getting a little redundant.
4,34,Man With Glasses,Hello. I'm Pierre Du Bois (Du-Boise). One-day landscape artist. (shakes hands with Linda)
4,34,Linda,"Hi! Oh, it's not Du Bois (Du-Bwa)?"
4,34,Pierre,No. It's just like it's spelled. It's French!
4,34,Pierre,Except Floraine ain't French. He's from Dutch.
4,34,Floraine,(speaks in Dutch)
4,34,Pierre,"That's Dutch for ""It's nice to meet you.""."
4,34,Linda,"Huh. To my American ears, it almost sounded like, ""Where's Perry?"""
4,34,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Special surveillance photos tells us that Doof is outfitting his skiff with something. It's hard to tell--"
4,34,Carl,"(offscreen) Sir, I looked up the window at his building just now, and saw the mysterious object was actually a bucket. A huge bucket."
4,34,Major Monogram,(to Carl) Carl!? Why didn't we just look out the window in the first place?
4,34,Carl,I don't know sir.
4,34,Major Monogram,"Doggone it Carl, we can't keep wasting out funds like this! (to Agent P) Well anyway Agent P, I guess you can go over there and see what he's gonna do with that large bucket. (Agent P leaves)"
4,34,Carl,Is he gone sir?
4,34,Major Monogram,"Yeah, c'mon, let's go to Vegas."
4,34,Buford,"Hey Baljeet, check this out! It's a kite, but it totally looks like a pirate ship!"
4,34,Baljeet,That is very nice! (He walks up a ladder supported by a huge dragon kite as the scene pans out. Chinese music plays.) Have you seen my kite?
4,34,Buford,Wow! Is it there even be enough wind for something like that?
4,34,Baljeet,"There should be, with Phineas's wind amplification device."
4,34,Isabella,"So, how does this work again?"
4,34,Phineas,"You start by blowing a bit of wind into the intake funnel. (Phineas inhales, then blows into the funnel. Pan to a tank filled with liquid that looks like water, in which Phineas points at it.) Then we have super cool liquid nitrogen to cool things down. Cold air sinks, until it starts to warm back up again. (Pan to a huge blow torch) And that's where we heat it up with a giant blow torch. And then, as it accelerates, it sucks up more air volume, and eventually blows it out with acceleration. (Pan to a huge funnel that opens up to let wind out. A bird flying into it loses all its feathers and is blown away.)"
4,34,Isabella,But that was just one big puff of air! How can we fly kites like that?
4,34,Phineas,Simple! Irving has volunteered to keep puffing air into the intake. (Irving is seen climbing up a ladder.)
4,34,Irving,"I've been eating mint all morning! (shows a bunch of mint) You know, so it won't be stinky!"
4,34,Isabella,"That's very thoughtful of you, Irving."
4,34,Irving,(snidely) I didn't really do it for you.
4,34,Linda,"So here's the yard. I want something nice out here. I think you know what to do. (everyone stops walking, Linda turns to landscapers) You are the landscapers after all."
4,34,Floraine,"Ze is gelijk in. (""She's right about that."")"
4,34,Pierre,"Actually, we are landscape artists. (picks up car door with poster) Do I need to show you the car door again?"
4,34,Linda,"No, no. It's fine. I'll be inside if you need me. (walks away)"
4,34,Floraine,"Een - nul. (""One - nil."")"
4,34,Pierre,"No, I didn't get the money up front."
4,34,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"")"
4,34,Phineas,Is everyone's kite ready?
4,34,Baljeet,All set.
4,34,"Buford, Isabella",Ready!
4,34,Phineas,"OK Irving, let her rip!"
4,34,Irving,Roger wilco! (He inhales and then blows with all his might into the wind amplifier. The amplifier then blows out a huge amount of wind. The kites start to fly.)
4,34,Isabella,It's working!
4,34,Buford,"Wow, minty! (Cut to him) Ah hoy! Avast ye sworty dogs!"
4,34,Baljeet,"Wow Buford, you look like a real pirate!"
4,34,Buford,That's nothing. Watch this. Fire! (A cannon in the ship shoots out cannonballs.)
4,34,Baljeet,"(getting hit by the cannonballs) Ow, ow, ow ow ow!"
4,34,Isabella,"Hey Phineas, watch this! I'm jumping clouds! Whee!"
4,34,Phineas,"That's awesome, Isabella. Watch this! (His robot kite turns into an automobile.) Now I'm in a car!"
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Enjoy your welcome-to-Danville lunch and ladies. (Point of view shot from Doof.) Soon, Grulinda, you shall taste the wrath of--(Perry suddenly appears in front of binoculars) Perry the Platypus?! (Cut to Doof and Perry.) Oh, before I forget, I got you a little lair-warming gift. (Doof gives him a ring box. Perry opens it, and a yellow rope is tied tightly around him.) Ha ha! You fell for the old spring-loaded-cable-trap-hidden-in-a-ring-box trick. What the? Th-that's a thing. Obviously. I bet you're wondering why I'm spying on a garden party. (Cut to Doof.) OK, maybe not wondering, but I'm going to tell you anyway. (Flashback.)"
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) It all started when I was a child, back in Drusselstein. There was this mean girl named Grulinda. Every day she would pour water on my head. (Young Grulinda laughs after pouring water over young Doofenshmirtz's head.) No matter where I was, (Young Grulinda again pours water over young Doofenshmirtz's head and laughs.) or what I was doing, (Young Grulinda again pours water over young Doofenshmirtz's head and laughs.)"
4,34,Young and Present-day Doofenshmirtz,(together) Stop pouring water on me!
4,34,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,Bewege dich nicht! (Don't move!)
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"But by some wonderful twist of fate, (Doof shows Perry a magazine with a picture of an ugly girl and a beautiful one.) she has moved here to Danville! See? (reads caption underneath picture) Grulinda Boubenweir moves to Danville, party being held in her honor at Danville Park. (stops reading, cut to Doof and Perry.) And the party just started, I don't know how they got this picture in the magazine so quick. Eh, I guess they're trying to compete with the internet. (closes magazine) But, I digress! (cut to a giant bucket of water.) I can finally have my revenge! With this! (turns to Perry) The Sog-inator! (evil laugh) Now I will fly over her party, and douse her, with a lifetime of soggy humiliation! (pause) What? Oh, you think that it's petty that I held onto this grudge for so long. Oh, it's not petty. It's not. (looks at Perry sarcastically) It's evil or something; it's not petty."
4,34,Linda,"Okay guys, I'm dying to see what you-- (gets shocked and drops tray of lemonade. The lemonade falls to the ground and breaks. A cat's yowl is heard.) What is that?"
4,34,Pierre,"Well it's not finished yet. But it's juxtaposition of the irrigated world of the suburban lawn the dryness of the natural summer environment. A water bucket dumping desert cacti, honey suckle basket, weak glass handle, extra spiky bubble cacti in place of the water."
4,34,Linda,"(angrily) That looks- that's- (groans, walks away)"
4,34,Floraine,"Ik denk niet dat ze het leuk vindt. (""I don't think she likes it."")"
4,34,Pierre,"Not to worry, great art always takes time before it's accepted."
4,34,Linda,Hello?
4,34,Candace,"Mom, I need you to go into my closet and tell me what--"
4,34,Linda,"(places hand on forehead) Candace, I- look- call me in a few minutes. I'm a little ticked off right now."
4,34,Candace,(she gets a surprised expression on her face.) What happened?
4,34,Linda,"Du Bois made a huge mess in the yard; they ripped off the lawn, there's a giant bucket, and a bunch of catuses. (raises voice in an angry way) I'm so mad! I gotta go."
4,34,Stacy,"Candace, what's wrong?"
4,34,Candace,"(weakly, referring to Phineas and Ferb) It's the boys, they're busted. (She falls over.)"
4,34,(Song,"""Straight Up Bust"")"
4,34,Candace,"♪ I don't believe it, Stacy ♪"
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"We should be over Grulinda's party any minute. Then it's soggy revenge time! (part of water from giant bucket falls off) Whoa! It's windy up here. If that keeps up, I don't have enough water to dump on her. (Perry thinks for a while, then bumps giant bucket on purpose. He does this one more time.) What? Did you hear that? (Perry just keeps quiet)"
4,34,Irving,Uh oh.
4,34,Baljeet,Whoa!
4,34,Isabella,"It's getting a little ""rainy""."
4,34,Buford,A little!
4,34,Phineas,Looks like we better climb down.
4,34,Buford,"Just remember, Baljeet, a captain always goes down with the ship. (gives hat to Baljeet)"
4,34,Baljeet,"Oh boy, a promotion. (Buford jumps down, and he realizes.) Hey!"
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"What's that noise? (the huge amount of water splashes onto the machine, causing Doofenshmirtz to hold on to the handle.) What the heck there? You've been dumping out my water? Oh, this had better not not be empty."
4,34,Pierre,"(offscreen) Okay Linda, I know you're gonna love this. (Cut to landscapers standing next to a giant spinning wheel.) This is the irrigation wheel! Each section represents a different section of the garden. (spins wheel) It's a comment on the capricious nature of our existence. (wheel stops spinning, and arrow points on a band of flowers) Some get water and live, others go dry and die!"
4,34,Linda,(facepalm) This is ridiculous. I don't want to end up with a yard full of (pause) dead plants!
4,34,Floraine,"Ik heb water in mijn laarzen. (""I've got water in my boots."")"
4,34,Linda,(with still hand on forehead) What did he say?
4,34,Pierre,"He said, (angrily) ""GREAT ART TAKES TIME!"" (normal voice) in Dutch."
4,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, watch it. (falls over) Ugh! Now watch the ailerons! (He falls into bucket again. He climbs out of the bucket. The bucket falls over and crashes onto the wind amplifier. It breaks, causing Doofenshmirtz to fly into the air carried by a huge amount of water. The water shoots into the clouds, and Doofenshmirtz falls back down to earth.

I needed to restrain you for this next part because it does get a little bit evil. Just to ensure there's no real competition, I built a little gadget called the Rustinator. At the push of a button, it will reduce every other car into red dust! Or rust. Wait, red dust, rust. I wonder if that's where that word came from. (exits) I'm gonna go look up its entomology.

4,4,Doofenshmirtz,"(Speaking very rapidly) Gotcha. And you don't even know it yet. That's the beauty part. Watch this prolonged series of unnecessary events. (Doofenshmirtz launches a kangaroo, causing a ball to roll down a flight of stairs, through a tube) W-w-w-watch this. (the ball causes a car to drive into a target, launching an anvil into a catcher's mitt, dropping a cage on Perry) Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yes! Ha! I win! I know it's a little over the top, but I was inspired by this board game I love when I was a kid. Well actually, it was Roger's board game. But I would sneak a peek of it, through the keyhole of his door. You know it looked like I would love it. But, I borderline backstory. (He takes a few short breathes) You see, I have so much evil energy from the soy venti latte extra-caf-and-a-half quadruple sugar, blood pressure bomberino. Love it! So I spent the whole morning building this complex, giant version of the game. Really I surprised you didn't see it flying in. Okay, beholding time! Behold my Luff-Flex-Dill-Pickle-inator! What does it do, you ask? (takes out a screen) Well it will launch all of my enemies into orbit, and keep them floating there so far into the atmosphere, that they won't bother me anymore. Cool, huh? Yeah I know the name's a little weird, but hey, I bought it off the internet, and my rights to it expire tomorrow, so I was kinda forced to use it today. I have so much energy from that one cup of coffee, I just keep rambling-- (Perry hops out of a hole in his cage) Ooh. you know that trap was always the lamest part of the game. I always though-- (Perry attacks Doofenshmirtz)"

4,4,Isabella,Whatcha doin'?
4,4,Phineas,Well our inspiration for today's activity manifested as we performed our morning ablutions.
4,4,Isabella,I love it when Phineas uses unnecessarily long words for common things like brushing your teeth and washing up.
4,4,Baljeet,"Yes, it is gratifyingly erudite."
4,4,Isabella,It's not as cute when you do it.

4,4,Buford,"It's a little preach-y for my taste, but count me in too."
4,4,Isabella,I'll help with the super structure.
4,4,Baljeet,Ooh! I will spray on the enamel coating.
4,4,Irving,And I'll sell ballooths. (Isabella and Baljeet stare at Irving) Balloons in the shape of a tooth.
4,4,Baljeet,"Oh, you mean toothalloons."
4,4,Isabella,Ballooths? Where'd you get ballooths from?
4,4,Buford,"Yeah, that's toothalloons. And I'll lock it all down, and make sure it doesn't move."

4,4,Candace,"(Looking out of her window) Let's see how the rookie's doing on his assignment. (Quirky Worky Song in the background) Hmm, not bad. I kinda like his style."
4,4,Irving,Toothalloons! Get your toothalloons here!
4,4,Phineas,"Alright everybody, all aboard the tooth-buggies. Ferb even installed dental floss-themed seat belts."
4,4,Isabella,"Mmm, minty."
4,4,Phineas and Isabella,Wa-hoo!
4,4,Candace,"Not so fast! I knew too! You're giving up, and just going on the ride for fun."
4,4,Buford,"Not hardly. I swiped this bad-boy (His rivet gun) from the orthodontist's section, to cut off stuff sticking out of the ride that could snag a passing plane as they go along."
4,4,Candace,"Listen, this thing ain't snag on a plane is just the tip of the bicuspid. It could shrink down to the size of a real tooth, and get lost in the grass. Or turn to ice, and melt into nothingness. For all you know it could turn into a giant Ducky Momo, and fly away. Are you prepared for all that?"

4,4,Phineas and Isabella,Yeah! Woo-hoo!
4,4,Baljeet,"(To Ferb) You know this is tame compared to other roller coasters, but when you compare it to other dental themed rides, it is a rush!"
4,4,Doofenshmirtz,"(Weaving from behind a giant pink kangaroo) Now you see me. Now you don't. Now you see me. Now you don't. Hehe. (Perry punches him, and Doofenshmirtz falls down the stairs, and slides across the ramp of the trap) Hey, where'd ya' go? (Perry bounces up to the catches mitt holding the anvil) I've got you now Perry the Platypus. (Doofenshmirtz bounces up to get him, but smashes into the anvil, which then falls on him.) Ow!"

(Buford throws assorted objects in the path of a green rays) Oh, man, I've run out of conveniently placed objects. Bingo. (Buford runs, and grabs Irving's helium balloon) Coming through!"
4,4,Irving,My toothalloons!
4,4,Buford,"Yeah, they weren't selling anyway. Not on my watch. (Another beam hits the helium tank, and it floats away) Ah! The helium tank! Actually it's kinda ironic when you think about it. (Buford sees another beam heading towards him, and in slow motions blocks the beam with his body) Not on my watch! (He begins floating upward) Yes! The human shield tactic never failed. (He notices his shoe laces are caught on the tooth) man, I knew I should have hung onto that laser."

That's what I was planning to do. Perry the Platypus, looks like this is the end for you. (Doofenshmirtz lines up his -inator to hit Perry. However Perry throws Doofenshmirtz's shoe at him, causing the -inator to fire at Doofenshmirtz's building, and Doofenshmirtz to flip over the edge of the building, having him hang their by only his knees) Just not nice!

(Perry just looks at him unimpressed.) I know what you're thinking. And, no, I did not invent a spray bottle, Perry the Platypus. Just stay with me through my backstory, alright? You see, I was reading The Danville City Charter...again, when I learned an interesting fact."
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Back in 1805, Danville actually elected a warthog as mayor. The public was fed up with the previous administration and thought, ""Hey, what's the worst that could happen?"" Nepotism, that's what. He filled the cabinet with his uncles and brothers and distant cousins and all of City Hall was full of swine. Except for one chair that they kept empty, so y'know it wouldn't be..."
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"...so conspicuous. So it was decided never to allow another warthog to be in a position of authority. Pe-Perry the Platypus, are you texting while I'm monologuing?! (He is. Doofenshmirtz takes the cell phone away. Perry simply shrugs.) Y'know, I'm just gonna hold onto this until I'm done, (puts phone in his pocket) 'cause I can get your full attention. Anyway, I'm thinking, ""Nepotism. City Hall. My brother, Roger."" And suddenly, I know what to do! Turn my brother into a warthog!"
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) So, through the use of pseudo-technology, I created this elixir, that, when sprayed on an individual, actually transforms them into a warthog."
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"What? I said, ""pseudo."" Anyway, once I collected enough elixir, I put it in this: my Warthog-Sprayer-inator! See? There's a method to my lameness. I'm gonna find out when Roger's on stage and then I'm gonna turn him into a warthog in front of everybody! That will remove him from power because of the aforementioned Warthog Nepotism Act.

4,37,Isabella,Look! It's one of Klimpaloon's threads and it's trying to find its way back to him.
4,37,Candace,Follow that thread!
4,37,Baljeet,We cannot follow a thread.
4,37,Buford,Again with the negativity.
4,37,Phineas,Maybe we can use it as a homing device. Ferb?
4,37,Phineas,Let's go!
4,37,Baljeet,Is no one going to talk about where we got the snowboards?
4,37,Candace,There's no time for that now! Come on! Come on! Come on!
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, man, Roger's not on 'til the end of the show? Can't you get him back sooner?"
4,37,Stagehand,No. Who do you think you are?
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,I'm his brother.
4,37,Stagehand,Nepotism will get you nowhere with me.
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, maybe not yet, but wait 'til Roger's a warthog! (he leaves)"
4,37,Stagehand,I do not know what that means.
4,37,Phineas,That must be Mr. Random's fortress! Follow me!
4,37,Candace,Now what?
4,37,Phineas,"Okay. (gets into the snow and maps out a diagram) I'll just create a diversion here so that Buford and Baljeet can flank them from the left. Ferb can then use his intimidating shout to scatter them so that Isabella can come in from behind. That should work unless they have reinforcements. What do you think, Baljeet? Can you give me a number crunch real quick?"
4,37,Baljeet,"Uh, gimme a sec. I am coming up with a 32.3% chance of success."
4,37,Phineas,"Well, we've seen worse."
4,37,Buford,"Alright, guys, let's do this! BUFORD VAN STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!!!!!!"
4,37,Phineas,He just ran in!
4,37,Candace,(going after him) Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
4,37,Isabella,"(also going after him) Dangit, Buford!"
4,37,Phineas,"(also going after him, angrily) Stick to the plan, man! Stick to the plan!"
4,37,Baljeet,What the?!
4,37,Buford,What? I used gamer strategy.
4,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, now I just have to set the spritzer, and the timer, and whoomp!, there he is! My brother, the warthog, mayor no more! (maniacal laughter)  Yeah. (sighs) Y'know, it's not the same without Perry the Platypus. I can't believe he ditched me. One lousy award and he goes all diva! Pfft!"
4,37,Candace,What the heck is all this?
4,37,Isabella,That's just...so wrong. They're...they're just horrible!
4,37,Mr. Random,You'll have to excuse me if this device seems incredibly threatening. It's only because...it is incredibly threatening!
4,37,All,(gasp)
4,37,Phineas,Klimpaloon!
4,37,Klimpaloon,(sadly) Nang...nang...nang... (etc.)
4,37,Mr. Random,"As you clearly saw, my previous attempts to create the future of swimwear without Klimpaloon just were not working!"
4,37,Phineas,(angrily) You fiend!
4,37,Mr. Random,"Look, I'm givin' Old-Timey here a new twist! Flashback to fashion forward! It's a little high-concept, but take a look!"
4,37,(Song,"""Flashing Back To Fashion Forward"")"
4,37,Mr. Random,♪ We're flashing back to fashion forward ♪
4,37,Buford,"If by ""catchy"", you mean ""sucks the life outta the room and makes me wanna puke""...then yeah."
4,37,Mr. Random,"Anyhoo, now that I have the original, I can figure out what makes him tick. Which brings us back, obviously, to the incredibly threatening machine. So, it's time to extract Klimpaloon's life force, and, uh, then, of course, infuse it into my latest swimwear line."
4,37,Phineas,We have to do something!
4,37,Ferb,How about this? (pulls the plug)
4,37,Mr. Random,"Aw, come on! Did we blow the breaker again, Fred? Fred? Frederick, is that— (Crashes into something) That stings."
4,37,Phineas,"C'mon, guys! Now's our chance to free Klimpaloon and—"
4,37,Buford,BUFORD VAN STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
4,37,Baljeet,"Oh, no, not again!"
4,37,Buford,So I did it again. (At least he got chicken!)
4,37,Candace,So what do we do?
4,37,Phineas,"Save Klimpaloon, of course!"
4,37,Klimpaloon,Nang nang nang... (etc.)
4,37,Phineas,There he is! Follow his voice!
4,37,Buford,Got 'im!
4,37,Baljeet,Ow! That is me!
4,37,Buford,Whoops. My bad. That wedgie was unintentional.
4,37,Candace,I got him! (the lights turn back on) Let's go!
4,37,Mr. Random,"Guards, don't let him escape!"
4,37,Klimpaloon,Nang nang nang nang... (etc.)
4,37,Baljeet,"Oh, they are too fast! We are never gonna make it!"
4,37,Candace,"Okay, we've gotta split up. Ferb, hide Klimpaloon under your jacket to keep him quiet and I'll lure the guards the other way with my ""Nang nang nang""! Just get him to the awards show!"
4,37,Phineas,"But, Candace, you'll miss your big chance to—"
4,37,Candace,Saving Klimpaloon is more important! Now go! (they split up) Nang nang nang nang nang nang... (etc.)
4,37,Mr. Random,"Alright, hold on. (stops his dancers as he hears Candace nanging) That way! Follow that vintage swimwear!"
4,37,Buford,Good thing they left the door open!
4,37,Dancers,"Ooh! Cold, cold, cold, cold, etc."
4,37,Mr. Random,Great. Now I'm reduced to yak transport.
4,37,Stagehand,"(to a security guard) Got it boss, it's go time!"
4,37,Max Modem,...and that's how we met.
4,37,Stagehand,"Okay, folks, on stage in five!"
4,37,Max Modem,Righty-ho!
4,37,Sherman,"Wow, what a great story."
4,37,Danny,"(offscreen) Bobbi, come on!"
4,37,Bobbi,"Huh? What? Wait up, guys!"
4,37,Roger,"And now, to present our final award for the evening, which, of course, was supposed to be our first award, but you remember that whole ""does Klimpaloon exist"" hullabaloo... Anyway, welcome again, Lindana and Max Modem."
4,37,(Song,"""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun""/""Alien Heart"" (instrumental))"
4,37,Lindana,"Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence, it appears that Love Händel has been disqualified. So, without further ado, the winner of the award for Best Fact-Based Song is—"
4,37,Phineas,Wait! We have the evidence!
4,37,Lindana,"I'm sorry, kids. The journal isn't good enough. You need actual, physical proof."
4,37,Phineas,But we do have physical proof! Ferb?
4,37,Klimpaloon,Nang nang nang nang... (etc.)
4,37,Drummer,I thought you said you'd stop at nothing to keep them from finding Klimpaloon.
4,37,Slamm,That's right. I did nothing and stopped.
4,37,Max Modem,How did you find him?
4,37,Lindana,And why are you all in parkas?
4,37,Candace,There's no time for that now! Mr. Random is a ruthless venture capitalist who captured all of us in his Himalayan fortress where he performed inhuman experiments on bathing suits and tried to destroy Klimpaloon in pursuit of a revolutionary swimsuit sales gimmick.
4,37,Lindana,"(thinking Candace is in busting mode again) Oh, Candace, not here. Not now."
4,37,Phineas,"No, Mom, really! Candace is telling the truth!"
4,37,Mr. Random,"Phuh! What an active imagination these kids have. We don't really have time for that now, we need to present an award."
4,37,Phineas and the gang,(gasp)
4,37,Mr. Random,"No, no, let's get the award done. Tick tick tick. Time's a-wastin'. Shall we?"
4,37,Max Modem,"Well, obviously, Klimpaloon is real. So it gives me great pleasure to present the award for Best Fact-Based Song to..."
4,37,Lindana,"Love Händel for ""The Ballad of Klimpaloon""! (applause)"

I'll unravel his secret, even if I have to rip him apart, stitch by stitch and then, the moronic people of the world will beat a path to my door, and beg for my cheap Klimpaloon knockoff line, 'cause consumers are just like lemmings, brainless little animals that I can manipulate right off the fiscal cliff like the puppet master that I am!

4,37,Phineas,I guess he's on his way back to the Himalayas.

4,37,Phineas,See you later!Be cool!
4,37,Isabella,See ya!
4,37,Buford,"See you, Klimpy!"
4,37,Baljeet,Safe travels!
4,37,Buford,I don't want him to go. I want him to stay with us.
4,37,Ferb,Klimpaloon doesn't belong to us. He belongs to the ages.
4,37,Buford,I said that back in the Himalayas! Does no one listen to me?!
4,37,Baljeet,"Uh, how are we getting home?"
4,37,Mr. Random,♪ We're flashing back to fashion forward ♪
4,23,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, doing a little light summer reading, I see."
4,23,Candace,"This is for the book club Jeremy and I joined. We all read the same book, and then we get together, and discuss over tea."
4,23,Phineas,Sounds sophisticated.
4,23,Candace,"Yeah, the tea was my idea. This week we're reading, The Iliad."
4,23,Phineas,That's a great book! It's all about the Trojan War.
4,23,Candace,You read this?
4,23,Buford,We all did. You're not the only one with a book club you know.
4,23,Phineas,"I like your idea about the tea though. Ferb, make a note of that."
4,23,Isabella,The war started because Paris fell in love with Helen of Troy. It's so romantic.
4,23,Buford,"Yeah, and Helen could launch a thousand ships with her face! My favorite character was Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior of all time. He had this big fight with Hector. He was all, Wham! Bam! Stab! Stab! Stab!"
4,23,Baljeet,Cut it out!
4,23,Candace,Isn't there something with a wooden horse?
4,23,Phineas,"Yeah, the Greek army build a huge wooden horse, and left it outside the gates of Troy. The Trojans thought that the Greeks had given up, and that the horse was some sort of tribute to them. So they wheeled it inside the gates."
4,23,Buford,Hey! How'd they get that big horse in that tiny door?
4,23,Baljeet,"Buford, just try imagining a larger door."
4,23,Buford,"Oh, okay. Hang on. (Buford pauses to imagine a larger door) Oh, yeah, that's better."
4,23,Isabella,"Then late at night, the Greeks climbed out of the horse, opened the gate--"
4,23,Buford,Then it was all; Wham! Zam! Stab! Stab! Stab! (Buford stabs Baljeet again)
4,23,Baljeet,Cut it out!
4,23,Candace,"Wow, it really sounds exciting. I'd better get started. Book club is in three hours. Bye."
4,23,Phineas,"Wow, she must be a fast reader."
4,23,Buford,"What gets me, is why did the Trojan War take so long? If I were Achilles, I could've taken the city of Troy, like, in one afternoon."
4,23,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna finally recreate the Trojan War. I'll be Paris because my name starts with a P."
4,23,Isabella,"And I'll be Helen because- (Realizing she wrapped her arm around Phineas's) Ah, my... name... starts... with... I which is right after H. (smiles awkwardly)"
4,23,Buford,And I'll be the great Achilles. And I'll be all; Wham! Zam! Stab! Stab! Stab! (He stabs Baljeet again)
4,23,Baljeet,Ahhh! Cut it out!
4,23,Buford,"(To Baljeet) And you can be Hector, now get over there. I'm taking Ferb."
4,23,Irving,"(From behind the fence) Hey, everyone! Can I play?"
4,23,Buford,No!
4,23,Irving,I've got baklava.
4,23,Buford,Welcome to the Greek army.
4,23,Phineas,You know who loves history and historical reenactment?
4,23,Buford,"Hey, where's your dad?"
4,23,Lawrence,"(while tying his tie) So it goes over, under, around and through. Ooh, lovely. Time to open the shop."
4,23,Major Monogram,"Hello Agent P. I see you used the rabbit hole entrance. Heh, freaks the heck out of intruders. Anyway, no news on what Doof is up to yet we're still awaiting a surveillance report, from our special C.R. unit. Hey Carl! Any news from team Cockroach?"
4,23,Carl,"Nothing yet, sir. We think they may have been scattered."
4,23,Monogram,"Quite frankly, we fear the worst, which isn't that bad, they're just a bunch of roaches after all. So, we're gonna need you to get over to Doof, and see what mischief he's up to today. Good luck, Agent P."
4,23,Buford,(Looking at the Troy Castle) And they say Rome wasn't built in a day.
4,23,Irving,"Uh, technically, that's not Rome, that's supposed to be Troy."
4,23,Buford,If I wanted nerd facts I would've kept Baljeet.
4,23,Baljeet,"(From the Castle) In case you are wondering, the word you are looking for is, ""impenetrable"""
4,23,Buford,Actually the word I was looking for is decimate!
4,23,Baljeet,Fair enough.
4,23,Buford,"Yeah, we're gonna need a bigger army. Irving break out my recruitment fustanella."
4,23,Irving,You mean the little Greek skirt--?
4,23,Buford,It's a fustanella.
4,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Coming, hold on. Just hold your horses. Wait. Hello? (He opens the door, and Perry flies in on his jetpack.) Ha! you missed me, Perry the Platypus. (Perry gets caught in a rope net trap) I got you. You see, I was just doing a little inventory and reorganization of all the stuff that I've collected over the last forty years. Yeah, I know it's gotten a little... out of hand. I kinda let it go, and Norm's been in Maui for like, a month, so I made a Declutter-inator. I was actually gonna shoot myself with it, which would make me want to un-clutter everything, and then I lost it, 'cause, you know, it's, it's really cluttered in here. So then I hired a nice young lady named Doreen, to help me get organized, and well, I think she may have gotten lost, too. I haven't see her in days. (Yelling into the clutter) Doreen? Are you out there?"
4,23,Doreen,So thirsty...
4,23,Doofenshmirtz,I never approved overtime!
4,23,Doreen,Food...
4,23,Doofenshmirtz,"So if you'll excuse me I have to get back to my search for Doreen. Maybe I'll get lucky and find the Declutter-inator, too. (Yelling back into the clutter) Hey Doreen? Marco!"
4,23,Doreen,Water!
4,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, she really stinks at this."
4,23,Buford,"Okay, Next! Name?"
4,23,Balthazar,"Balthazar Horowitz, but you can call me ""The Ballpit Kid."""
4,23,Buford,Any medical problems.
4,23,Balthazar,"Well, I have a perforated A-"
4,23,Buford,"Yeah, yeah yeah, you're in. Get a shield. Come back with it, or on it. Next! Name?"
4,23,Boy,Dimitri Popaunicolas.
4,23,Buford,Any experience being Greek?
4,23,Dimitri,Actually I am Greek. I was born on the Island--
4,23,Buford,"I don't want your life story. Grab a shield, come back with it, or on it. Irving, go get some more baklava, come back with it, or on it."
4,23,Irving,I'm on it.
4,23,Buford,Yeah? Well get with it.

4,23,Candace,"Are you by any chance reenacting the Trojan War, like in my book?"
4,23,Phineas,That's the plan.
4,23,Candace,"Okay, I'll just watch you guys, and take notes for my book club. Buford, continue."
4,23,Buford,"Hey, uh, Hector? Why don't you come down here, I got something for ya'."
4,23,Baljeet,"Oh, sweet. I am going down there. (He comes down from the castle) Okay, here I am. What have you got for me?"
4,23,Buford,Get him!

4,23,Irving,"(Now in the T-rex) Seriously, if you were just gonna crush the Trojan Platypus, why did I--"
4,23,Buford,"Leave me my simple pleasures. Now Ferb, destroy Troy! This is why I got Ferb on my team."
4,23,Phineas,"Uh-oh, looks like Ferb's going off book. Everyone to the chariots. (Everybody loads into the charriots, and they take off to do battle with the T-Rex) Hang on. (Phineas fires laser's out of his chariot, which just bounce off) Whoa, laser proof! Nice touch Ferb."

4,23,Candace,"Ooh, me! In general I thought the Greek's decoy platypus was a brilliant idea until it got smashed by the T-Rex. It's use of lasers to destroy the city of Troy really seemed unbeatable, until Paris flew down in his laser chariot. The flying chariots were all; Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Phew! Gak! Gak! Gak! And Eew!"

4,44,Charlene-2,"(narrating) Like all terrible things, it started with small-minded people who became great. Victory was near. But small things can also be good, and can work against evil, like how a tiny cat hair can ruin an evil sandwich. The great empire fell and fell some more. And what was once evil melted away and was replaced by the love of a choo-choo. Soon all discovered that there was more to life than vigilance. All but one."
4,44,Candace-2,"(voiceover) War journal entry number... Uh, I mean, Dear Diary, It's been two months since the fall of Doofenshmirtz, but every morning I think I'm gonna wake up back in the underground. I feel restless. I need a challenge. I need a mission. I can feel myself getting softer. Doofenshmirtz is in jail and everyone is trying to embrace their new freedom. I alone know better. I can feel evil still out there, getting stronger while I sit in my room, waiting for the other shoe to drop."
4,44,Buford-2,"Hey, guys! I think I stepped on a slug."
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,"A slug, really?"
4,44,Buford-2,Wait a sec. What do you call those things that eat nuts and live in trees?
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,A squirrel?
4,44,Buford-2,Yeah. It was definitely a slug.
4,44,Phineas-2,Where's your other shoe?
4,44,Buford-2,I dunno. I must've dropped it.
4,44,Candace-2,"(from her bedroom window) Hey, what's all this about the other shoe dropping?"
4,44,Phineas-2,Buford stepped on a slug.
4,44,Candace-2,"Okay, but be careful down there. Call me if there's any trouble. (She backs away from her window slowly, then quickly peers back out.)"
4,44,Phineas-2,"So how's the ""summer fun"" coming along, Dr. Baljeet?"
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,"Well, since the Phineas and Ferb from the first dimension suggested we make the most of our summer, Buford and I have been experimenting with fun, and so far..."
4,44,Buford-2,"So far, I'd rather be breakin' rocks for the state. But, in all fairness, I do love breakin' stuff."
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,(to Phineas-2) What about you? How have you embraced your freedom?
4,44,Phineas-2,"Fortunately, we've had a little help, thanks to the coolest pet ever."
4,44,Phineas-2,"Here, boy! Fetch!"
4,44,Phineas-2,Cool!
4,44,Ferb-2,Any pet can fetch a stick.
4,44,Phineas-2,What was that noise?
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,It is some kind of metal door.
4,44,Phineas-2,"(to Perry-2) Here, boy, pull the chain."
4,44,Phineas-2,Whoa!
4,44,Lawrence-2,"Oh, hello, boys. I see you found my secret stash."
4,44,Phineas-2,"What is it, Dad?"
4,44,Lawrence-2,"Well, that's what's known as ""sporting goods""."
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,What do you do with them?
4,44,Lawrence-2,"Back in the old days, before Youknowwho, people used to use this stuff to play sports."
4,44,Phineas-2,Could we play sports?
4,44,Lawrence-2,"Well, I don't suppose there's any reason to hide this stuff anymore. So, yes! As they used to say, ""Have a ball!"""
4,44,Phineas-2,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna use these goods and play a game of sports!"
4,44,Candace-2,(grunts) 999...
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Good, you're home."
4,44,Candace-2,Monogram? Is there trouble? Do you need me?
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Hoo-hoo, stand down there. We captured Doofenshmirtz. Nothing left to resist. And it would look foolish to just stand there, resisting nothing... Well, unless you're a mime. Then it would look totally cool."
4,44,Candace-2,"If there's no trouble, why are you calling?"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Oh, right! Ahem. As you know, after our agents were all captured and OWCA fell, your resistance partly operated out of our old headquarters."
4,44,Candace-2,"Yeah, so?"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Yeah, well, um, now that we're trying to rebuild our spy network, I was wondering, um, where did you put the keys?"
4,44,Candace-2,They're under the ceramic frog.
4,44,Carl-2,"(appearing on the right side of the vanity) Oh, I love your three-monitor vanity!"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,Carl will be helping me locate our animal agents so that we can—
4,44,Carl-2,"(spinning around) Hey, I got my own monitor! Wee-hee!"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Carl, do you mind?"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Now, let's see. Where was I? Oh, yeah. (During this, Carl-2 appears on different sides of the vanity and mocks Monogram-2) So, yeah, if-if you get a chance, tell Agent P he can return to work anytime, and, uh, and if you see any other small animals, you can tell them to... Carl, why don't you go over and check the ceramic frog?"
4,44,Carl-2,"Yes, sir."
4,44,Candace-2,"Major Monogram, do you want me to come over there and help you guys?"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"No, no. Doofenshmirtz is in jail. Everything's fine. Go-Go to your picnic and relax. Dress festive, be young! Ha. You've earned it."
4,44,Candace-2,"But, Major, I'm trained to—"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Leave the responsibility to us, young lady."
4,44,Carl-2,"(offscreen) Look, Major Monogram, I found it!"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Carl, no! That's a real frog!"
4,44,Carl-2,(offscreen) Oh.
4,44,Frog,Ribbit.
4,44,Carl-2,(offscreen) Ew!
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Yeah, I gotta run. You go have fun."
4,44,Candace-2,"(sighs and gets her red shirt from a coat hanger) Well, I guess it's time to dress festive."

4,44,Candace-2,Right.
4,44,Isabella-2,"Candace, I thought you were going to take it easy. Whatever happened to that whole Jeremy Johnson thing?"

4,44,Candace-2,Ow! Ow!
4,44,Isabella-2,"Candace, you have to eat the ice cream slowly. What is that?!"
4,44,Candace-2,"Giant mechanical ants! My brothers are in trouble! On your feet, kid, it's go time!"

4,44,Candace-2,I got it! (She fires a grappling hook at it.) Whoa!
4,44,Isabella-2,(skating past Candace-2) On your right!
4,44,Phineas-2,Oh no! They got Perry!
4,44,Candace-2,Are you guys all right?
4,44,Phineas-2,"We're fine, but cyborg animals have captured Perry."
4,44,Candace-2,"The robot ants must have been a diversion. (turns on her cell phone) Monogram, we just got ambushed at the picnic. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it."
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"(on screen) Well, that's impossible. He's right here in our detention facility. I-I-I just played checkers with him. (He cheats, by the way.)"
4,44,Candace-2,These giant ants didn't send themselves!
4,44,Phineas-2,Ask him about the cyborg animal agents!
4,44,Major Monogram-2,The what?! Was one of them a panda and the other one of those shaky rat dogs?
4,44,Phineas-2,"Yeah, yeah, where'd they come from?"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Ah, well, I didn't want to say anything before, but we kind of lost track of some of the agents when Doof took over."
4,44,Candace-2,How many did you lose?

4,44,Carl-2,"26, sir."
4,44,Major Monogram-2,26!
4,44,Phineas-2,"Ferb, if we can access Perry's location chip, maybe we can ambush those cyborgs and rescue Perry."
4,44,Candace-2,"Yeah, no way! You guys are staying here where it's safe."
4,44,Phineas-2,"Candace, we can handle this. Who was it that got past the security grid to free you from Doof's tower?"
4,44,Candace-2,"Okay, but take the Firestorm Girls. It could get hairy. And while you do that, I'll go find out who's behind all this."
4,44,Phineas-2,"Come on, Ferb!"
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Ah, Choo-Choo, look! We have company!"
4,44,Candace-2,"All right, Doofenshmirtz, what do you know about robotic picnic ants and a fist-full of cyborgs?"
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Ants at a picnic? So it's a...it's a rhetorical question, is it?"
4,44,Candace-2,"Don't play smart with me, villain. You're behind the attack at the park. Now, spill it!"
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"What? You're blaming me? I-I-I've been locked up in here with Choo-Choo. Isn't that right, Choo-Choo? Yes. Yes, it is. See? H-He'll provide an alibi."
4,44,Candace-2,Don't lie to me! There's Doof-tech scattered all over that park.
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Well, it wasn't me. There is, however, another Doofenshmirtz."
4,44,Candace-2,Vanessa! I knew it!
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"No, no, not Vanessa. She's just in high school. And she doesn't show any aptitude for evil. As a parent, I'm really disappointed. No, I'm-I'm talking about the other other Doofenshmirtz. Charlene! (whip pan to a photo of Charlene-2) ♪ Bum bum bum! ♪"
4,44,Candace-2,And who is that?
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,Charlene Doofenshmirtz. She's my ex-wife. I-I guess you guys have never met. That kinda takes away the drama of the reveal. But it's her.
4,44,Perry-2,(Chatters angrily)
4,44,Isabella-2,Pinky! You're alive!
4,44,Isabella-2,Don't you remember me?
4,44,Isabella-2,Apparently not.
4,44,Phineas-2,"We're gonna get you outta here, Perry!"
4,44,Phineas-2,We got Perry! Everybody fall back!
4,44,Buford-2,Now this is as much fun as bustin' rocks for the state!
4,44,Major Monogram-2,We've had Doofenshmirtz moved to this interrogation room so Candace Flynn can question him thoroughly.
4,44,Carl-2,Are you sure he can't see you?
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"It's a one-way mirror. Here, watch this. (He makes a face at Doof-2.)"
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"You know, I can see you!"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Oh, maybe it's just that he can't hear us."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"I can hear you, too!"
4,44,Major Monogram-2,Huh. Maybe I just don't know how this one-way mirror thing works.
4,44,Mover,Comin' through.
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Oh, okay. Now I'm embarrassed."
4,44,Candace-2,"Alright, knock it off, glamour boy."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,I just haven't seen a mirror for two months. Did my hair always look like this?
4,44,Candace-2,Just park your caboose in that chair.
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,Choo-Choo is not a caboose. It's an engine.
4,44,Candace-2,"Clam it, wise guy! You know why I'm here and you better cooperate, because there are worse things than sittin' in a cold, dank prison cell with your little choo-choo train."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,Like what?
4,44,Candace-2,"Like sitting in a cold, dank prison cell without your little choo-choo train."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,You wouldn't!
4,44,Candace-2,Try me.
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Alright, I'll talk."
4,44,Candace-2,"Tell me about your ex-wife, Charlene."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,What do you wanna know?
4,44,Candace-2,(slams her Bo staff on the table) Where's her hideout?
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Sheesh! She's got a penthouse uptown. You can't miss it. It has ""Charlene"" written in bright lights across the top of it."
4,44,Candace-2,How do I get in?
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,You would have to pass through the identification scrutinizer. Only a Doofenshmirtz can get through.
4,44,Candace-2,"Lucky for us, we got one of those."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Yeah. Oh! You mean me, right?"
4,44,Phineas-2,"Dr. Baljeet, we're back and we have Perry!"
4,44,Dr. Baljeet,That is great. And I think I figured out how to get this giant ant going again.
4,44,Phineas-2,Great! So everything's going to plan?
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"(offscreen) Hey, kids! (cut to reveal Doof-2 on a dolly cuffed and facemasked) Where do you keep the silverware?"
4,44,"Isabella-2, Holly-2 and Adyson-2",(gasp)
4,44,Isabella-2,What's he doing here?!
4,44,Candace-2,At ease. He's still a prisoner. I'm just using him to get into Charlene's penthouse.
4,44,Phineas-2,"Wow, cool restraints."
4,44,Candace-2,"Actually, he asked for this stuff."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"The mask makes me sound all creepy. Here, check this out. Fava beans... Fava..."
4,44,Candace-2,"Okay, that's enough. Hey, where's Ferb?"
4,44,Phineas-2,"Oh, well, I'm sure he'd just—"
4,44,Candace-2,"Ugh! We don't have time to wait for him. We gotta get over to Charlene's. Phineas, Perry, you're with me."

4,44,Candace-2,"(to Doof-2) Now, you, do what you have to do to get us in."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Okay. Okay. (He puts his hand on the scanner, then his eye in the retina scanner.) Aaahhh... (A machine scans his tongue and ear.)"
4,44,Candace-2,"Wow, the identity scrutinizer is really thorough."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"You have no idea. (Ding! The doors open) Come along, people."
4,44,Vanessa-2,"Uh, Mom, Tony Marzulo asked me out to the movies. Can I go?"
4,44,Charlene-2,(getting her nails filed by a rat-borg) Didn't your father banish him?
4,44,Vanessa-2,"Yeah, but Dad banished every boy that asked me to the movies. Besides, Dad's no longer in power."
4,44,Charlene-2,"The day isn't over yet, dear."

4,44,Vanessa-2,"Uh, thanks?"
4,44,Candace-2,"Okay, fellas. There she is. Let's get her attention. (She swipes some plates off the shelf behind her with her Bo staff and the plates shatter into pieces.)"

4,44,Candace-2,But why?
4,44,Phineas-2,"Ferb figured that if Doof and Charlene thought that they had the leader of the Resistance and the Platyborg under lock and key, they would devote all their attention to the frontal attack. That way, we could come up from behind and—"

4,44,Charlene-2,"End of the line, kid! What a shame! I'll make ya an offer. I could get rid of you right now or you could join me. You could be the leader of my cyborg army."
4,44,Candace-2,"(smiling) Actually, it looks like your cyborg army may have changed their minds."
4,44,Charlene-2,"Wait, what are you talking about? (Agent R-2 breaks off one of Charlene-2's fingernails.) My manicure!! (she trips over a piece of equipment) Whoa!"
4,44,Candace-2,"It's all over, Charlene. (The reformed animal agents surround her.) Now surrender."
4,44,Charlene-2,Ha! (presses a remote causing another capsule to come out of the floor) A Doofenshmirtz never surrenders! We fight until the last man!
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Hey, wait a minute! I'm the last man! D-Don't I get a say in this?"
4,44,Charlene-2,"Oh, come on, honey. It'll be fun."
4,44,Vanessa-2,"Alright, hold it! Everybody just stop! (opening the animal agents like a door) Excuse me. (to Candace-2) Can I talk to my parents? Listen, Mom, Dad, come here. You guys, I'm only gonna say this once. (breathes) RUN!!!"
4,44,Vanessa-2,"Mom, Dad, this is Tony Marzulo."
4,44,Tony,"Hey, Mr. and Mrs. D."
4,44,Doofenshmirtz-2,"Hey, didn't I banish you?"
4,44,Charlene-2,"Yeah, honey, you did, but nobody saw it."
4,44,Candace-2,"Academy graduates, Doofenshmirtz is still out there and no doubt he's planning a comeback. But so are we. We now have you, the animal agents of OWCA, who will, without a doubt, prevail. So as I step down from my position as head of the Resistance, (Monogram-2 and Carl-2 react to this in fear) I congratulate you all and wish you luck."
4,44,Major Monogram-2,"Whoa, wait! You're stepping down?"
4,44,Candace-2,"It's okay, Major. You've got your animal agents back. I think you can handle it."
4,44,Major Monogram-2,But...
4,44,Candace-2,"Don't worry. (She gives Monogram-2 her Bo staff.) If you ever get in a pinch, you know where to find me. Now if you'll excuse me, there's something I've been putting off that I need to take care of."
4,44,Major Monogram-2,Where is she going?
4,44,Isabella-2,"Unless I miss my guess, I'd say she's making room in her life for other things."
4,44,Jeremy-2,15...16...17... (Candace-2 joins him) 18... Hey!
4,44,Candace-2,"Hey, yourself."

4,45,Becky,"Hey, Vanessa! How was your summer?"
4,45,Vanessa,"Oh, the basic. Pretty cool when I was at my mom's and okay when I was at my dad's. Did you know in July, he actually removed all the blue from all the paintings at the museum? All the blue!"
4,45,Lacie,"Omigosh, I totally saw that! Picasso's whole Blue Period is just beige now."
4,45,Vanessa,Yep. That was my dad.
4,45,Johnny,Sigh.
4,45,Vanessa,"Hi, Johnny."
4,45,Lacie,It looks like he didn't take your breaking up very well.
4,45,Johnny,(offscreen) Sigh.
4,45,Vanessa,"It wasn't like we were going out that long, Johnny!"
4,45,Johnny,"Just take the dissection tray and use its wax foundation to cradle my broken heart, Vanessa!"
4,45,Male Student 1,"Let it go, bro."
4,45,Vanessa,And to think I wanted to come back to school for a sense of normalcy.
4,45,Principal Lang,"Good morning, people. As you know, there have been some staff changes. If you'll sit down, I will introduce you to your new science teacher..."

4,45,Principal Lang,Dr. Doofenshmirtz is here on a trial basis.
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, no, we already had the trial. The judge gave me a choice of doing hard time or community service. So, here I am, ready to impart upon these young, sponge-like minds all my vast knowledge of evil sci—I-I mean science. That's right. Regular old science. No evil at all. In fact, I've crossed out the word ""Evil"" whenever it appears in my old textbooks. So, this should be a piece of cake. (to Vanessa) Hi, sweetie-kins! (Vanessa slams her head on her desk.) Thank you, Principal Lang. I can take it from here."
4,45,Principal Lang,"Just so you know, Heinz, I've got my eye on you. I miss nothing."
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"And nice to see you, too! (to the class) Y'know, we knew each other long ago, but that's a story for another time. I'm Dr. Doofenshmirtz. (writing on the blackboard) D-O-O-F-E..."
4,45,Vanessa,"Dad, come here. (she grabs him out of the classroom)"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,Uh... (pops back into the frame) ...enshmirtz!
4,45,Vanessa,"Dad, what are you doing here?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,Isn't this great? More father-daughter time!
4,45,Vanessa,"No, not at my school! Really?"
4,45,Johnny,So you're Vanessa's dad? I'm Johnny.
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,Didn't she dump you?
4,45,Vanessa,We were hardly going out!
4,45,Johnny,"(whining) Yes, we were!"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, girls don't like guys who are whiny. You're whiny. I get it. I get it."
4,45,Becky,"Mr. Doofenshmirtz, if you're Vanessa's dad, is she gonna get, like, special treatment? I've taken extra booster classes in science to ensure my early acceptance—"
4,45,Vanessa,"No! No special treatment, because this is not happening!"
4,45,Lacie,(beat) What's goin' on?
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Everybody, back in class."
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,"Principal Lang, are you brooding again?"
4,45,Principal Lang,"Why does everyone always think I'm brooding? It's my brow, isn't it?"
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,Well...
4,45,Principal Lang,"Yes, I'm brooding! It's that Heinz Doofenshmirtz! We went to community college together."
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,Oh.
4,45,Principal Lang,"He wound up marrying Charlene, the girl that I was in love with!"
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,Aren't they divorced now?
4,45,Principal Lang,That's not the point!
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,"Oh, I'm sorry."
4,45,Principal Lang,How could she have preferred him to me?
4,45,Mrs. Pierpoint,"Well, maybe it's time to give up your grudge."
4,45,Principal Lang,Give up a grudge? Never! What do you think this brow is for?
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Let's start with genetics, the building blocks of life. Your genes determine what you will be. A...A turtle or a bird or... For instance... (plucks a hair off of Johnny)"
4,45,Johnny,Ow! Hey!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, don't be a baby. You've got plenty. At least for the next ten years. Let's see genetics at work, shall we? (He puts the hair in a petrie dish, and puts the dish under a microscope.) Now, all of the information that makes this young man who and what he is is stored in these DNA strands in every cell of his body. The-The genetic code is very delicate. See, now, if we move this base pair over to here, he would have been a gorilla, or you know, maybe a lizard. Y'see, there's this whole world of things going on, too small for us to even notice."
4,45,Yellow insect,"So, what are we doing here again, Napoleon?"
4,45,Napoleon,"(the purple insect) Well, Wendell, we're going to make contact with these magnificent giants!"
4,45,Wendell,We will?
4,45,Napoleon,"Yes, we will."
4,45,Wendell,Wait. Why will we?
4,45,Napoleon,"To be the first ones to communicate with a alien race. Just think, Wendell, you and I and Floyd are going to go where no bug has gone be— Okay, where's Floyd? Floyd!"
4,45,Floyd,"Sorry, sir. Ran into a spider web. Lost my wings."
4,45,Napoleon,"They're behind you, Floyd."
4,45,Floyd,"I found 'em, sir."
4,45,Napoleon,So as I was saying—
4,45,Floyd,They were behind me.
4,45,Napoleon,"Yes, we've established that. Continuing, we are going to make contact with the giants! But first, we must scale the Cliffs of Mahogany! (referring to the desk) This may take a few tries, but—"
4,45,Wendell,"Sir, let me throw it! I'm the muscle!"
4,45,Napoleon,You're the muscle?
4,45,Wendell,"Yes! You're the brains, I'm the muscle, and Floyd is..."
4,45,Napoleon,Floyd is the ballast?
4,45,Wendell,Yes! Floyd is the ballast!
4,45,Floyd,"Ooh, that sounds important."
4,45,Napoleon,"Anyway, Wendell, if you're feeling muscular, be my guest."
4,45,Wendell,"Stand back! (He swings the grappling hook, which is actually a string with a bent paper clip on it. The clip latches onto a beaker. The beaker tips off the desk and traps the bugs.)"
4,45,Napoleon,"Hmm. Well, we have a limited air supply. Floyd, stop breathing."
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that's unfortunate. (takes the dish off) Uh, hopefully, the DNA in the petrie dish won't combine with... (Johnny starts growing a lizard tail) Oh! Oh! No, see, it's... It's happening already."
4,45,Johnny,(looks behind him) Uh... (begins transforming and howls like a gorilla. His right arm becomes a gorilla arm.)
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, so everyone pay attention to this. This is what I was talking about. The DNA of a human is only a few base pairs from that of a monkey. (Johnny's left arm becomes a lizard's arm.) Or... or a reptile for that matter."
4,45,Johnny,(growls and runs away)
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,See? I told you. A whiner.
4,45,Johnny,What is happening?!
4,45,Carl,"Uh, sir? I think you should take a look at this."
4,45,Major Monogram,Great googly moogly! I was afraid it might come to this.
4,45,Perry,(chatters tiredly)
4,45,Major Monogram,"Agent P, pick up! (turns over sleepily and scratches his rear) Agent P, please pick up! (Perry finally picks up) Ah! So sorry, Agent P, I... I know that this is your time to enjoy some well-deserved rest, but something's gone wrong in Doof's class, and, well, the OWCA work-release program doesn't need this kind of scandal. Whadaya say, P?"
4,45,Becky,"Guys, Johnny's running wild out there!"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,Aha!
4,45,Vanessa,"Dad, what are you doing?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"It's one of Johnny's hairs. It's loaded with his DNA. With this, I can mix up an antidote to..."
4,45,Gideon,(offscreen) He shapeshifted again!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"No no no. This isn't Johnny. It's, uh... (whispering) Perry the Platypus, I'm glad you're here. Could you go find Johnny and bring him back to the classroom? He's got greasy hair and he's wearing a trench coat. Mmm, and he's also part-gorilla, part-lizard. You can't miss him. (out loud) Class, Mr. Platypus is the...occasional assistant teacher."
4,45,Male Student 2,Is that a real platypus?
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"No! It's a.... it's a man. It's a deformed, tiny...turquoise man. Vanessa, take some of your friends here, uh, uh, Ponytails, Spikey Head, Tweedle-Tie and go get Johnny."
4,45,Vanessa,"Hi, ""Mr. Platypus""."
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, and the rest of you, Muscles, Ropey Face, Slap-Happy, Buzzy-Pants, stay here and help me with the antidote."
4,45,Ropey-Face,"Wait, why am I Ropey-Face?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,Take my advice: Own it.
4,45,Vanessa,"Johnny? Er, ""Creature formerly known as Johnny""?"
4,45,Johnny,(hiding under the bleachers) Go away!
4,45,Vanessa,"Johnny, you've gotta come out! My dad can help you!"
4,45,Johnny,You hate me!
4,45,Vanessa,I don't hate you. We can be friends.
4,45,Johnny,(sees Perry) Huh? Whoa! What is that thing?!
4,45,Vanessa,He's just a tiny turqouise m— AAAAH!! (Johnny carries Vanessa off like Fay Wray.)
4,45,Johnny,Vanessa!
4,45,Vanessa,Perry!!
4,45,Napoleon,"Expedition journal, entry three. We have bivouacked on a landing halfway up the cliffs."
4,45,Wendell,I don't remember bivouacking.
4,45,Floyd,I went before we left.
4,45,Napoleon,"Oy. Bivouac. It's a makeshift camp. That—Look, it's not important. What I'm worried about is, what are we going to tell the giants about ourselves?"
4,45,Wendell,Floyd throws up on his food.
4,45,Floyd,It's true. I do.
4,45,Napoleon,Let's not lead with that.
4,45,Floyd,I can also smell through my hair.
4,45,Napoleon,But what do we say to an alien species to make them understand our entire culture? Our very place in this vast cosmos?
4,45,Napoleon,What is happening?!
4,45,Floyd,I think I just bivouacked again.
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Careful. Careful. Everything depends on getting the mixture precise. (Becky drops the liquid into the beaker. Doof stirs it with a straw and drinks it.) Mmm. Excellent. Now that's how you make a Shirley Temple. Hey, Muscles, how's the antidote coming?"
4,45,Muscles,(wearing a hazmat suit and carrying a radioactive stick) Al...most... done. (drops it into the graduated cylinder and it explodes a bit. He pours it into the petri dish and Doof gets some of it with a needle.)
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, we're all set. Now, where's whiny reptile boy?"
4,45,Vanessa,(offscreen) Somebody help me!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,(offscreen) He has Vanessa! (to the rest of the class) Who's up for a field trip?
4,45,Johnny,Sanctuary!
4,45,Vanessa,"Oh, you're such a drama queen. See, this... This is why we broke up!"
4,45,Ropey-Face,"Wait, where's he going?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, now, how're we gonna... Nobody has a crossbow, do they?"
4,45,Becky,"I do! (beat) What? Why, is that weird?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great! Thanks! (climbs in) Hey, you got new cup holders."
4,45,Ropey-Face,Whoa! Mr. Platypus has a cool ride!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Hang on, sweetie! (to Perry) Well, I guess it's just like the old saying, ""You turn a guy into a gorilla-lizard, and he carries your daughter up a bell tower."" It never really made sense to me before, but now I guess I... (Johnny pushes a bell off and it lands on Perry with a long DONG!)"
4,45,Principal Lang,It is not one o'clock!
4,45,Sally,"Hey, guys! How's it coming? Recess is almost over!"
4,45,Phineas,Almost done!
4,45,Phineas,"(pointing) Ferb, look!"
4,45,Vanessa,"Johnny, put me down!"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, would you just stand still?! I can't get a clear shot!"
4,45,Phineas,Aw man! I can't wait 'til we get to high school! It looks like so much fun!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, hold still! I'll get it—"
4,45,Vanessa,"Dad, do something!"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, yes, yes! Hold on a second! (He attempts to fire the crossbow, but he and the bell topple off of the hovercar.)"
4,45,Vanessa,Dad!!
4,45,Johnny,"Vanessa, you saved my life!"
4,45,Vanessa,"Oh, please don't read anything into this."
4,45,Johnny,There's still hope!!!
4,45,Vanessa,What did I just say?!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, everyone, back to class. Nothing to see here. Just a giant bell."
4,45,Principal Lang,What in the bell?
4,45,Napoleon,"We've done it! We've reached the summit! Unfurl the banner, boys, and follow me! This is it! My entire existence has been leading to this moment, so that I can say... ""Weclom Ginats!"" (realizes what the banner says) Wait, what? ""Weclom Ginats?!"""
4,45,Wendell,What does that mean?
4,45,Napoleon,"Exactly my point. What does our ""Welcome Giants"" banner actually say?"
4,45,Wendell,"Oh, yeah, sorry, we spelled it phonetically."
4,45,Napoleon,"NO YOU DIDN'T!!!! Phonetically, it spells, ""Weclom Ginats!"" Come on, guys! This is our only chance to make a good first imp—"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"And that, class, is DNA in action."
4,45,Principal Lang,(bursting through the door) Aha!
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,That's it for today. Class dismissed.
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Bye-bye, now."
4,45,Vanessa,"(walking up to her father) Dad? (sighs) So, you're my teacher now."
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,I'm your teacher now.
4,45,Vanessa,"But, we're not gonna do...all of...""this""...every day, right?"
4,45,Doofenshmirtz,"I'll try. But you know, (to the tune of the Theme song) ♪ there's 261 days 'til next summer vacation ♪, and, you know, a lot can happen. Just saying."
4,45,Napoleon,Ugh. I do believe I've fractured my exoskeleton.

Your last chance to bust the (steps on a rollerskate) boooo- (steps on a skateboard and rolls down the stairs) -ooooooo – ugh!

4,47,Candace,(unenthusiastically) Uh-huh. (pauses) And so begins the last day of summer. (wagon is stopped by Perry's dish)
4,47,Linda,(getting up with her purse) Which means back to school errands for me and making the most of the day for you. (looking at her watch) Ooh! I better get a move on. Those errands aren't gonna run themselves. (chuckles) They never do! (unenthusiastically) They never do. (leaves)

4,47,Baljeet and Isabella,Oooooh!
4,47,Buford,"Eh, could use a little somethin' more. (more blueprint rolls out above the first one) Dere it is, but where's Perry?"
4,47,Major Monogram,"Oh, good, Agent P, you're here! You're probably wondering about all these pulley things here. (eyes directing to tassel-like pulleys on his left and right) It's just that, with Carl heading to school soon, I'm (pauses) gonna have to learn to run this place all by myself. (grips the pulleys) Anyway, (pulls his left one to make a crudely drawn picture of fall leaves roll down in front of him on the screen) with the seasons about to change, I suspect Doofenshmirtz (a crudely drawn picture of Doofenshmirtz rolls down) will be trying to close out the summer (a crudely drawn picture of a ""bang"" rolls down) with a bang. (all the pictures, with his right pulley, fall to the floor) Great googly moogly! Carl! (his left pulley, still being gripped by Monogram, comes detached and dangles from his left hand.)

4,47,Phineas,"Anyway, we've gotta make sure we've outdone ourselves on this one."
4,47,Buford,And there's only one way to do it.
4,47,Phineas,"You're right, Buford. Let's ride it! (everyone but Buford starts running towards the invention)"
4,47,Buford,"Actually I was gonna say focus group testing, (starts running to catch up to the others) but ""ride it"" works too."
4,47,(Song,"""There's No One I'd Rather Go Nowhere With"")"
4,47,Candace,"(walking outside) Aha! The boys did it again! Big, dangerous, bustable: prime for megabust! (lifting cell phone and dialing a number) I'm calling Mom right now!"
4,47,Phineas,"Say ""Hi"" for us!"
4,47,Linda,"I know, I know. I'm on my way."
4,47,Candace,"(on the cell phone) I'll meet you up front! (hangs up, then calls again) Hehehehehehehe."
4,47,Phineas,"So, whadya say, guys? Best ride ever?"
4,47,Baljeet,"(looking at papers in his hands) Well, empirically speaking, the test results show almost unanimous approval ratings!"
4,47,Buford,(coming down beside Baljeet) I have notes.
4,47,Baljeet,Like I said: almost.
4,47,Phineas,"(smiling) Well, you heard him, Ferb. Back to the drawing board!"
4,47,Baljeet,"(staring at their invention, now a drawing board) Wow, that was impressive, and quite literal."
4,47,Candace,Tada!
4,47,Phineas,"(waving to them while standing next to Ferb, who's drawing on the drawing board) Hi, Mom! Hi, Candace!"
4,47,Candace,"But, but but!"
4,47,Linda,"(taking Candace to the side) Look Candace, most days I would humor you, but not today. I'm way too busy. Don't you have stuff of your own to do before school starts?"
4,47,Candace,"Yeah, bust the boys!"
4,47,Linda,Candace?
4,47,Candace,De-de ge-de de-de-de-de daaahhhh... (sulkily) I guess I can return Vanessa's DVDs.
4,47,Linda,"(walking away) There ya go, Hon. They're not gonna return themselves."
4,47,Candace,They never do.
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(approaching the drum set while looking at Perry) Ah, Perry the Platypus: snared in my trap. (Norm plays a rim shot on the drum set) Ha! Drum pun! (starts walking away from the drum set onto the balcony) I realized that all this time I was planning to become ruler of the Tri-State Area, never took into account the fact there is no actual position. I should have spent my time creating one. And, if I create it, no one will know about it. (hops up to sit on the rim of the balcony) I will run unoppo (falls off the balcony) whoooa! (catches himself with his hands and lifts his face back over the side) That was close. Then I'll easily win, and (lifts up his left hand into a fist) take over the Tri-State Area. With that in mind, (lets go with both hands) be- (holds them up in the air and starts falling) hooooooooo... (Perry is shocked, teeth clenched, eyes wide open. Then the elevator dings and Doofenshmirtz comes back in and approaches his Inator with his arms up again.) Behold: The Tri-Governor-inator! (a drum roll sounds, Perry rolls over Doofenshmirtz with the bass drum, and a cymbal crash sounds) Wow, an actual drum roll. (Perry hits the banister, one drum head and hoop falls off, and Perry leaps out.) Ay-ah! (the doorbell sounds as Perry leaps on Doofenshmirtz and starts fighting him)"
4,47,Vanessa,"(walking past them) Please, so over it. (she opens the door to let Candace in, smiling)"
4,47,Candace,"(waving while holding DVDs) Hey, Vanessa! Just came by here to return (realizing it's Candace, Perry lets Doofenshmirtz out of a headlock and hides) your DVDs. Sorry I had them so long, can't say I understand French cinema. I mean, why does that mime keep letting go of balloons?"
4,47,Vanessa,I think it's (Perry finds a hiding spot) symbolic.
4,47,Candace,"(handing Vanessa the DVDs) Well, anyway, how's it goin'?"
4,47,Vanessa,(starts feeling uninterested and stops smiling) I've been better.
4,47,Candace,"(still smiling and gesturing) Me too! You wouldn't believe (stops smiling, but still has her eyes wide open) the day I'm having so far! I mean really. Like I could go on. Like I could tell you all about it. I mean there's a lot that happened and there's—"
4,47,Vanessa,Yooou wanna (starts smiling again) come in?
4,47,Candace,"(starts smiling again and comes in while Vanessa closes the door behind her) Oh wow, ya, that'd be great!"
4,47,Vanessa,I could use some downloading too. I'll go make us some tea. (starts walking away) B-R-B.
4,47,Candace,"Awesome! (starts walking towards Doofenshmirtz, who is now standing and is brushing himself off) Oh, hi, Vanessa's dad! How's it goin'?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(turning around to talk to her) Have you seen my nemesis? He was just here a second ago. He's about (holds his hand at an approximate height of Perry) yay high and—ha. You know what? No matter. When the guy who's punching you suddenly loses interest mid-punch, it's time to take serious stock of your life. (turns around) H-ugh."
4,47,Candace,I can totally relate! (Doofenshmirtz starts walking away) Like from the beginning of today it was pretty bad. Like I'm all off.
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,(trying to find Perry) Uh-huh.
4,47,Candace,"And you know every day this summer I've been trying to bust my brothers, and it's just not happening."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Uh-huh.
4,47,Candace,Do you know how frustrating it is to have a single unrealized focus in your life?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Well that's just crazy. Gotta be some kind of teenage thing. (starts walking back over to her after giving up on finding Perry)
4,47,Candace,"Same old, same ol' yadda yadda ya bledolbledolbledolbledolbledolbledol. That's been my day so far. (starts lowering herself onto an Inator)"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(runs to her and frantically waving Candace off the machine) Don't sit on that, a-and stop fussing with all of my Inators!"
4,47,Candace,Inators? Why? What does this (points at the machine she almost sat on) one do?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, that is my Do-Over-Inator."
4,47,Candace,What's a Do-Over-Inator?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Really? It says ""do over"" right in the name. I-it does the day over again, but I haven't worked out all the kinks yet. Matter of fact, I gotta work out the kinks in a lot o' these."
4,47,Candace,"(looking at the machine) A Do-Over-inator? (presses the purple button second farthest to the left, causing the Inator to make loud mechanical noises and surround her and Doofenshmirtz with a large, glowing blue-purple bubble, then emit a blue flash)"
4,47,"(After we see a forever looping spiral clock, cut to Candace in her bed. Her alarm goes off going back and forth between saying, ""BUSTIN' TIME!"" and ""6","00"".)"
4,47,Candace's alarm,"(Phineas' voice, while beeping) I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're—"
4,47,Phineas,(offscreen) I know what we're gonna do today!
4,47,Candace,"(growls, gets out of bed, and shouts out the window) And I know what I'm gonna do today! Bust you guys once and for all! Do your worst or your— you know, just make it (starts feeling the familiarity of the conversation) big and... bustable, so I can show... Mom."
4,47,Phineas,(outside offscreen) Wow! That was awfully supportive.
4,47,Candace,"(walks away from the window) Talk about déjà v— (runs back to the window to talk to Phineas) You there, boy! What day is it?"
4,47,Phineas,"Why, the last day of summer, of course!"
4,47,Candace,"(enthusiastically) Aaah! Yes! Vanessa's dad's machine! It worked! Which means that yesterday is today! Another chance(steps on a rollerskate) to bust the boooo- (steps on a skateboard and rolls down the stairs) -ooys! I didn't think there would be this part!– ugh! (falls off the skateboard and loses the skate, lands in a wagon, and starts rolling around the house) Har... (pauses as she rolls behind a wall) dee har har."
4,47,Linda,"(reading the newspaper at the kitchen table) Oooh! Looks like the zoo's got a new tiger habitat. (Lawrence playfully roars at Linda and Candace rolls into the kitchen.) Good morning, Candace."
4,47,Candace,"(smiling) Mm-hmm! (pauses) And so begins the last day of summer! (wagon is stopped by Perry's dish and she pauses, then points at Perry) Again!"
4,47,Linda and Candace,(Linda getting up with her purse) Which means back to school errands for me and making the most of the day for you.
4,47,Linda,(angrily) Hey!
4,47,Candace,(happily getting up out of the wagon and approaching Linda) Hey! This is amazing! (approaching and holding onto a chair) Today is exactly the same as yesterday! It's repeating! (leans her elbows on the chair back)
4,47,Lawrence,"Very existential, darling. You're getting philosophical as you get older."
4,47,Candace,(walking away and pointing at Lawrence) And BUSTosophical!
4,47,Linda,(looking at Candace with lowered eyelids and speaking in a sing-song voice) That's not even a wo-ord!
4,47,Candace,(coming back) It is now! (walks around Linda and speaks in a sing-song voice) I made it u-up!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Ah! Taah... Didn't I disintegrate you? (to the light)
4,47,Norm,"(walking towards Doofenshmirtz's bed with a slice of chocolate cake) Wakey wakey, chocolate cakey! (takes a fork of it and points it at Doofenshmirtz)"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,(annoyed) Really? Didn't I tell you cake isn't for breakfast (knocks the cake out of Norm's hands and up and over the bed) yesterday? (realizes something) Hmm. (gets out of bed and runs out of his bedroom and Vanessa approaches him)
4,47,Vanessa,Hey Dad? (Doofenshmirtz turns around to see her)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(thinking) Hmm, repeating."
4,47,Vanessa,You have a minute?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,M-hmm.
4,47,Vanessa,We really
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,M-hmm.
4,47,Vanessa,need to
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,M-hmm. (Vanessa growls and starts frowning) Yeah!
4,47,Vanessa,Dad!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah! Everything is repeating! Th-that bang on my head, that-that thing with Norm and the stupid cake, a-and you! (starts walking to his Do-Over-Inator) I-it works! My Do-Over-Inator must work! Ah-your little friend must have (Vanessa catches up to him) activated it yesterday! A-and by ""yesterday"" I mean ""today"". Later today, your-uh little friend will activa– and the days will probably keep repeating until I shut it off!"
4,47,Vanessa,"(angrily) This is what I'm talking about. You're not even listening! (starts walking towards the door, without Doofenshmirtz noticing) I'm moving out, Dad. I'm going to live at Mom's... (walks out the door) full time. (slams the door)"
4,47,Norm,"(walking up to the door, still smiling) Door slams mean sadness."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,(running over to Norm) Wait! What did she say?
4,47,Norm's speaker,(Vanessa's voice) I'm going to live at Mom's... full time. (door slamming noise)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Aaah! I can't believe it! (inhales sharply) You surreptitiously record us? And even more importantly, I'm losing my little girl!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Why would Vanessa want to move out?
4,47,Norm,Let's see if we can solve that little mystery! (presses his top button)
4,47,Norm's speaker,"(Doofenshmirtz's voice) Hey, Vanessa, hand me that cadaver."
4,47,Norm,or (presses his button again)
4,47,Norm's speaker,"(Doofenshmirtz's voice) Honeybun, if you go into the living room and see a pile of skin flakes, just ignore it."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Okay.
4,47,Norm,or (presses his button again)
4,47,Norm's speaker,"(Doofenshmirtz's voice) I know you said the time machine in the bathroom was a bad idea, but if you need to go, you should do it last week."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Okay! Okay! I get it. I get it. My daughter's moving out because she thinks I'm a loser.
4,47,Norm,I like pancakes!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Buuuut, ya know who isn't a loser? The Tri-Governor! I just need to win that office and Vanessa will want to (starts walking towards his Do-Over-Inator) stay with me! And this (pets the Inator) little baby's gonna help me get it right."

4,47,Candace,"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. Perfect! You guys built your sky-high mega-ride thingy. I just wanted to double-check, and this time, I'm not gonna call Mom. I'm gonna (starts walking backwards away from them) go get her. Ciao!"
4,47,Phineas,"(holding his hand up) Bye, Candace! (turns back towards his friends) Sky-high, huh? I think you're right, Buford. We can make this better, and Candace has just given me a great idea how to do it!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(looking at his watch) Perry the Platypus should be coming in about three, two, one.

And, (Perry rolls towards Doofenshmirtz  in the drum and he hops out of the way) drum roll! (Perry rolls past him) Missed me! (Perry hits the staircase, flips over, then pops out of one of the drum's head and hoops.) And, skull! (a giant skull falls over Perry and traps him, then Doofenshmirtz walks over to him) It worked! It worked, and finally I get some use out of these old Halloween decorations. I'm the master of ti- (Perry opens the skull's mouth and clamps it down on Doofenshmirtz's body) ow! Oh, this really bites. (Perry breaks out of the top of the skull) Oh no, wait! Not my Inator! (Perry pushes the ""X DESTRUCT"" button on the Tri-Governor-inator and it blows up) That's okay, Perry the Platypus. I'll be the master of time tomorrow."

4,47,Candace,"Well, no one can say I didn't try, twice. (walks to the house)"

4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(rolling up to Perry while in a hamster ball) Ah-hu, hah! I can see by the confused and somewhat annoyed look on your face that your little mammal brain is working overtime trying to figure out how I anticipated your every move, not to mention the purpose of this... hamster ball.

Oh well, I'll have to... ignore that in my payroll, because (shows Perry still fighting through the series of traps) now that I've gotten a full thirty steps ahead of Perry the Platypus, I'm free to take over the Tri-State Ar— Vanessa, where are you going?

I know it seems like I'm putting you second, but it's only so I can put you first eventually!"
4,47,Vanessa,"Whatever, Dad. (walks away)"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Vaness— ugh. Well, you'll see. This is going to be my moment to take over the Tri-State Area and then that will prove to you I'm not as big a loser as you think I am. (walks towards his Tri-Governor-inator on the balcony) Okay, no pressure. Tri-State governor's mansion, here I come! (pulls a lever on the Inator that activates it and makes it shoot out a purple beam that creates a mansion on top of City Hall) Sa-weet! Now I've just gotta get someone to vote for me— anyone, actually, 'cause I'm running unopposed.

4,47,Roger,"(on the screen) Apparently, for the first time in Tri-State history, a Tri-Governor has been elected, and the voters have chosen, (looks down at his paper in shock) my brother, Heinz Doofenshmirtz?!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes! See, Vanessa? I'm not a loser anymore. Now you'll want to live with me at the Tri-Governor's mansion, right? Right?"
4,47,Vanessa,Dad! It's not that—
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, wait, wait, ho-hold that thought, sweetie-peeps. A-as long as my Do-Over-Inator is on, this day could start all over again. I could lose it all. So, so, you know. (holds her hands) Go 'head and start packing your stuff. I'm just gonna run over and turn off my Inator. We're, we're movin' on up, Kiddo! (runs over to his Inator just as it is getting sucked into another blue portal as he grabs at it) Hey! Well, uh, I didn't see that coming, but it's gone, so I guess that's the end of the looping! And now, (flips to Doofenshmirtz on the balcony of the Tri-Governor's mansion with his left arm around an unimpressed and slightly annoyed Vanessa) everything's gonna be hunky-dory, 'cause I'm in charge, baby!"
4,47,Candace,"Guys! Guys! I really need your help! There's this really weird thing that's happening! Days keep repeating because of a machine thingy that Vanessa's dad made, and there was this wagon, and now things are disappearing, like tigers, and spoons, and—"
4,47,Phineas,"What's a... ""spoon""?"
4,47,Ferb,"What's a ""tiger""?"
4,47,Candace,"See? That's my point! Stuff's disappearing! and once it goes, nobody remembers it— (Phineas and Ferb get sucked up into another portal) e-ever existed... (inhales sharply) Moooooo- (runs inside to Linda, who is vacuuming the living room) -om! It took them! (hangs on Linda) Like the spoons! (inhales) Mom, Phineas and Ferb are gone!"
4,47,Linda,"I'm sure it's going to be all right, dear, but, who are ""Phineas"" and ""Ferb""?"
4,47,Candace,How can you not know who Phineas and Ferb are?!
4,47,Linda,Lemme guess. They're your new favorite boy band?
4,47,Candace,"No, Mom. Y'see, later on today, which is kinda like last month to me, Vanessa's dad invents this thing which he says doesn't work but it actually does, because, well, here I am.  But it also doesn't work because they're not here, so even though every day repeats, not everyone or everything repeats, because you don't even know what Capri pants are!!"
4,47,Linda,"""Capri Pants""? Is that a boy band?"
4,47,Candace,They're— (slaps herself) Gah!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Check out your First Daughter suite! Not too keen to move out now, are ya?"
4,47,Vanessa,"Yeah. Very, very nice, Dad. But, listen, I have something I—"
4,47,Melanie,"Pardon me, sir, I hate to interrupt, but your schedule is jam packed today. (She takes Doof's hand and leads him out.)"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Sorry, sweetie, but apparently, there's a lot of stuff I have to attend to. Look on the bright side, you can brag about your dad to your friends until I get back."
4,47,Phineas,"This is so weird. It's Danville...but it's not. Oh my gosh, Ferb! Spoons! Now I totally remember how we forgot about them when they disappeared! Which means we must have disappeared."
4,47,Phineas,Orange you glad we have somethin' to eat? (no response) You're right. You're right. We gotta figure out a way outta here. (A tiger roars offscreen.) Hope whatever that is likes oranges.
4,47,Ferb,Or at least orange-related puns.
4,47,Buford,"(offscreen) But I'm tellin' ya, the sun's rays'll make ya crazy."
4,47,Isabella,"I'm not gonna buy your hat, Buford."
4,47,Candace,"Great! You're all together! Look, I need you guys to help me find my brothers!"
4,47,Buford,And you are?
4,47,Isabella,She's my neighbor from across the street. But I thought you were an only child.
4,47,Candace,"No, no, I have two little brothers and all of you are best friends! But then Vanessa's dad built this machine, and now the days are repeating and things like spoons and little boys like my brothers are starting to disappear. And the worst thing is nobody remembers them!"
4,47,Buford,You should stay out of the sun!
4,47,(Cut to,)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, Doofy-boy, time to govern-inate! (Perry enters the room on his jetpack.) Right on time, Perry the Platypus! (reading a piece of paper) This concerns you. I have just made it illegal to thwart the Tri-Governor of the Tri-State Area, which, ipso facto, is me. (Gives Perry the paper.) Go ahead, read it. It's all perfectly legal. Looks like your thwarting days are over, Perry the Platypus. (sighs) Y'know, I-I-I really miss our good old thwarting days already. I-In fact, your presence here is making me far too sad and nostalgic. So maybe you better go. (Perry leaves dragging his jetpack across the rug.) Just leave the way you came in. I'll bill ya for the carpet."
4,47,Perry,(chatters sadly)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, don't give me the puppy dog eyes. You're gonna make me cry. Sheesh. (Perry jumps out the window.)"
4,47,Melanie,"(on speaker) Pardon me, Mr. Tri-Governor, the Mayor's on the line."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Put 'im through. Helloooooooooo, Roger!"
4,47,Roger,"(on speaker) Heinz, did you steal my secretary?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Yes. Yes I did.
4,47,Roger,(on speaker) What makes you think you can do a thing like that?!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it's easy! (opens the floor revealing Roger at his desk looking up) Because I'm the boss of you! Nyah! (Closes the floor.) Ahh, this has already been a very productive day. (Melanie walks in with a huge stack of papers.) H-Hey, what's all this?"
4,47,Melanie,"More legislation that requires your signature, sir. (she leaves)"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"But I hate homework! I'd rather just play with this snowglobe. (Another anomaly appears and sucks the snowglobe out of his hand.) Oooh, oh! Oh, man, this is serious! I thought for sure my machine would've turned itself off when it disappeared, but it's still creating rifts in the space-time continuum! (pushes intercom) Melanie, bring me another snowglobe."
4,47,Melanie,"(on speaker) Um, what's a snowglobe?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,(gasps dramatically)
4,47,Phineas,"Wow, this stuff is pretty random. I hope no one at home is planning to baste a turkey while wearing suspenders and Capri pants. (no response) You're right. Mr. Keene is having a very bad day!"
4,47,Phineas,And so are we!
4,47,Phineas,"Run, Ferb! It's raining snowglobes! A-And the tigers, they are also a reason to run!"
4,47,Candace,"No, I really do have two brothers and you guys are really best friends. I can't believe you don't remember!"
4,47,Isabella,"That's impossible! Right, Baljeet?"
4,47,Baljeet,"Huh? Oh, sorry. I am too preoccupied with today's wild fluctuations in the space-time continuum. With pressure readings like this, I could potentially get sucked into a rift. And then none of you would remember I ever existed!"
4,47,Candace,Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
4,47,Major Monogram,"(on watch) Sorry, Agent P, I've received confirmation that Doof's anti-thwarting legislation is completely legal and official. So I guess we're the bad guys now. And I guess this means you're on hiatus at least until his term is over. Monogram out."
4,47,Perry,(chatters and sighs)
4,47,Vanessa,"(on another windowsill) Perry? What are you doing here? (Perry joins her) Problems with my dad, too? Welcome to the club. (sighs) I've been trying all day to tell him that I've been accepted by OWCA's internship program, but that I can't join if I'm living with OWCA's public enemy number one. (Perry holds up three fingers.) Okay. Number three. Well, I'm just gonna have to tell him and try to convince him to see things my way. Thanks for the chat, Perry. Wish me luck! (She goes inside and Perry waves at her.)"
4,47,Baljeet,"...and at the destabilization point, the vortex collapses in on itself, and it becomes an actual ""hole"" in space-time, sucking the nearest person or object into it and they are lost in the void."
4,47,Buford,"OH, PLEASE STOP TALKING!!!"
4,47,Phineas,"Okay, tigers aren't much more than big house cats, right? So what have we got that will distract cats?"
4,47,Phineas,"We don't have a ball of yarn, but we do have a big bouncy ball of Capri pants!"
4,47,Phineas,"That'll hold 'em for a while. Come on, Ferb! We gotta figure out a way back home."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Sweetie pie, I'm back! Sorry it took me so long. Who would've thought being Tri-Governor would be so involved?"
4,47,Vanessa,"Dad, I got an internship at OWCA, so I have to move out."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,What?! But that's the opposite of what I— They're the good guys! I thought for sure now that when I was Tri-State Governor that we'd be okay!
4,47,Vanessa,"Dad, you're totally missing the point. You spend all of your time working on your ridiculous inators and I can't—"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, first of all, they're not ridiculous. Convoluted and ultimately pointless, maybe."
4,47,Vanessa,"Oh, come on, Dad, you build them just to exact petty revenge trying to prove you're evil."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,What? I'm evil. I-I am evil!
4,47,Vanessa,"No, Dad. You're basically a nice guy who's pretending to be evil. And, you know, it seems like it's all out of obligation to your backstories, not something that truly comes from your heart."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow. So, it, it's... It's really not about all the success-loser thing?"
4,47,Vanessa,"Dad, look, this OWCA internship is something I really wanna do. And I don't think this lifestyle choice is making you happy either. Is it?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Wow again.
4,47,Vanessa,"Look, all I'm saying is try something different."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Like a...Like a new inator?
4,47,Vanessa,"No, like try to be a good guy."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"A good guy? Me? I can be... Well, I guess I could. I-I could be a do-gooder, doing good, just for the sake of... doing good, or, er, what exactly do good guys do?"
4,47,Vanessa,"Well, they—"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Eh, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I get it. I understand now.  There's just one thing I gotta do before the whole thing starts over ag—"
4,47,Candace's alarm,—know what we're gonna—
4,47,Candace,"Ah. (gets up) Oh, man! I gotta start all over again!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, man! I looped too soon, and I didn't have time to be good! (He disintegrates his lamp again.)"
4,47,Norm,Wakey wakey!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm, stuff your cake!"
4,47,Norm,"Stuffing it, sir! (He puts the cake on his face.)"
4,47,Vanessa,"Hey, Dad, do you have a minute?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Vanessa! Yes, yes, I know, you, you'd like to move in with your mother and you want to intern at OWCA and my being evil creates a conflict."
4,47,Vanessa,"Um, yeah. How did you know—"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Let's just leave it at I know and I vow to be good from now on so your worries are over.
4,47,Vanessa,"Wow, you're kind of freaking me out."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, yes, I'd be obnoxious if I wasn't so charming. Anyway, I have one more inator to complete and I've got to do it fast, so I could really use your help."
4,47,Vanessa,What's the inator?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,The Time-Straighten-Out-inator! It straightens out time and keeps it from looping.
4,47,Vanessa,I think I'm looping.
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Exactly!
4,47,Baljeet,I am coming!
4,47,Candace,"Morning, Baljeet. Got to get an early start today. You kids chat, I'll get the thingy."
4,47,Baljeet,"Um, who is that girl in the bathrobe?"
4,47,Buford,I was so asleep.
4,47,Isabella,She made us come over here.
4,47,Baljeet,"Yes, but who is she?"
4,47,Candace,"Got it! (to Baljeet) Here, Dr. Genius Boy! Take this and check out the space-time continuum."
4,47,Baljeet,"(takes the device) I do not know what that will prove. The space-time continuum is remarkably stable, and—Oh, my goodness!"
4,47,Candace,"Blah blah blah blah blah, you could disappear forever and so could every memory of your existence. So here's the part you need to pay attention to! Are you listening?"
4,47,Baljeet,I am totally listening!
4,47,Buford,I am so not listenin'.
4,47,Isabella,Me neither.
4,47,Candace,"I have two brothers and you guys are all best friends. But now they're gone and nobody remembers them because of the space-time continuum thingy. Now, this is the part of the conversation where you tell me how you're gonna get my brothers back."
4,47,Baljeet,"Well, they must have disappeared through a temporal rift. If we could calculate the location of the next rift, we could just throw in a rope with a life preserver tied to the end of it and pull it out."
4,47,Candace,"Oh, really? A little donut-shaped pool toy is gonna save the universe?"
4,47,Buford,"(eating a donut) Ya had me at ""donuts"", lost me with everything else."
4,47,Vanessa,So what you're saying is the days are repeating and you're the only one that notices.
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, maybe that little friend of yours, too, 'cause she was inside the bubble."
4,47,Vanessa,What?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Not important. Check it out. Perry the Platypus should be coming in three, two, one."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus! (Perry unbuckles himself) That's right, take it in, Perry the Platypus. No traps. And, no, telling you that there are no traps is not part of a trap. Though that would have been genius. Oh, I missed that one. I'm actually not doing any evil today! Seriously. I promise. (Perry looks at him with his arms crossed.) So, whadaya say, how 'bout lending an old nemesis a hand, huh, Perry the Platypus? (Perry just looks at Doof and holds out his arms.) Your eyes say, ""No!"" but your hands say, ""Yes!"""
4,47,Baljeet,"Isabella, what is the resonance reading on the top meter?"
4,47,Isabella,Forty-two point one six!
4,47,Baljeet,"Candace, what is the cosine of eighty-one point seven?"
4,47,Candace,(using a calculator) Lessee. Seventeen.
4,47,Baljeet,"Buford, did the light just change from green to red?"
4,47,Buford,Why should I tell you?
4,47,Baljeet,"Okay. (Baljeet makes some calculations.) Right... (pointing on a map) There! In fifteen seconds, that is the point of maximum disturbance! So it should be appearing right over...there! (A groundhog gets sucked into the rift.)"
4,47,Candace,"Wow. Crazy how it sucked up that groundhog, huh?"
4,47,Buford,The what?
4,47,Phineas,"If things from Danville pass into this dimension when a rift opens, maybe the door swings both ways. If we can calculate the rift openings, then we can get back to our Danville. Heads up, Ferb! Incoming!"
4,47,Phineas,Huh. Groundhogs.
4,47,Ferb,"I hope that doesn't mean six more weeks of ""Nullville""."
4,47,Phineas,Ahhhhh!
4,47,Candace,"Talk to me, Baljeet!"
4,47,Baljeet,"By my new calculations, the next rift should appear right over...there!"
4,47,Isabella,Quick! Throw the life preserver!
4,47,Candace,"Phineas! Ferb! If you can hear me, grab the life preserver and we'll pull you back!"
4,47,Buford,"What's a ""life preserver""?"
4,47,Isabella,I have no idea.
4,47,Candace,You guys are just gonna have to trust me on this!
4,47,All,Whoooooooa!!!!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Who'd have though we'd be such a good team? My daughter, my nemesis, and my hot beverage. (Takes a sip.) Hmm. Counter-clockwise on that jib bolt, Perry the Platypus. Okay, stop. Perfect, it's done. The days won't loop anymore and I'll have my daughter back! My life will be on a new path and the world will be saved thanks to brand new good guy, Heinz Doofen—"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, shmirtz! I was so close! (He tears the lamp from the ceiling.)"
4,47,Norm,Wakey wakey!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(throws the lamp at Norm and it lands on Norm's head) Eat it yourself, Norm, I gotta get Vanessa, we gotta do everything faster!"
4,47,Phineas,"Hi, guys! So good to see you!"
4,47,Isabella,(gasps)
4,47,(Flashback Montage,"Scenes of Phinabella from Flop Starz, The Chronicles of Meap, Hide and Seek, One Good Scare Ought to Do It!, That Sinking Feeling, Happy New Year!, Phineas and Ferb Summer Belongs to You!, What A Croc!, Minor Monogram, That Sinking Feeling again, Bee Day, Troy Story, It's No Picnic, The Klimpaloon Ultimatum, SBTY again, and SBTY a third time.)"
4,47,Isabella,"(lovelorn) Phineas! (normally) Hey, Phineas."
4,47,Baljeet,(gasps) Spoon!
4,47,(Flashback Montage,Various scenes of Baljeet using a spoon.)
4,47,Baljeet,"Oh, how I have missed spoons!"
4,47,Buford,Orange! (dramatic music; suddenly winds down) Eh...not really gettin' a big rush of emotions over this.
4,47,Candace,And here are the Capri pants.
4,47,Isabella,How can you tell they're Capri pants? Maybe they're just regular pants for someone with shorter legs.
4,47,Candace,(throws the pants away) The important thing is—
4,47,Buford,(offscreen) Hey!
4,47,Candace,—my brothers are here and they're safe! (She runs up to them and hugs them.) I'm so glad you guys are all right!
4,47,Phineas,"Thanks, Candace! It's great to see you, too!"
4,47,Candace,"Wow, I guess now that we're gone, too, Mom and Dad don't even remember having children. Their lives must be so empty."
4,47,(Song,Platypus Walk)
4,47,Isabella,Everything here is so gray and lifeless.
4,47,Baljeet,"This place must exist outside the flow of time. Candace, you were the only one of us outside the loop. Were the looping intervals decreasing in chronological amplitude?"
4,47,Candace,"No, they were, um... Wait, what does that mean exactly?"
4,47,Baljeet,Were the days getting shorter?
4,47,Candace,"Yes, the days kept getting shorter and shorter."
4,47,Baljeet,(shudders) The time pocket is dissolving!
4,47,Buford,"And where does that rate on the... ""good-bad"" scale?"
4,47,Baljeet,"Buford, when the time pocket ceases to exist, so will we!"
4,47,Isabella,See what I mean? One woman's Capri pants is another's... What'd I miss?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Vanessa!
4,47,Vanessa,"Dad, I have to talk to you—"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Help me build my inator! Hurry! Quick!
4,47,Vanessa,What're we doing?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Building a Time-Straighten-Out-inator.
4,47,Vanessa,"(sighs) Dad, we really need to talk!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"There you are! Perry the Platypus, grab a screwdriver and help us!"
4,47,Baljeet,"Okay, this paper towel represents the space-time continuum. Normally, it moves in a straight line, (he puts the paper towel on a hook) but something has disrupted the flow. Now time cannot move forward and it puts enormous strain on the fabric of time (tears the paper towel) and tears the fabric! So now there is a little less space-time fabric to work with. The days are getting shorter. Now, you take this shortened piece of space-time (puts the paper towel on the hook and tears it again) and loop it again. Do this enough times (crumples the paper towel and puts it in his pocket) and pretty soon you do not have anything left. What I cannot seem to figure out is what could have possibly caused the space-time disruption in the first place? And an even bigger conundrum is how Candace is standing outside of the space-time interruption and somehow knew about its effects."
4,47,Candace,"(nervous chuckle as she pulls on her shirt collar) Yeah, that's a puzzler. But you know that old saying: ""Never question the source of a...temporal time...space...loop thingy.""  Heh heh. Eh."
4,47,Phineas,Really?
4,47,Buford,"Yeah, I've heard that."
4,47,Baljeet,"Well, we have to build something to close the hole and stop the looping.  But it will require einsteinium, tungsten wire, and micro-crystal plasma resistors."
4,47,Phineas,"Well, stuff keeps getting sucked into this place. Maybe we can find a hi-tech machine or some lab equipment that uses all of that stuff."
4,47,Buford,What about this machine right here?
4,47,Phineas,Wow. Strange that we didn't notice that.
4,47,Phineas,"Einsteinium, tungsten wire, plasma resistors! Wow, this is awesome!"
4,47,Candace,Don't touch that thing! (running to the inator) That's the machine that started all of...this...So...um...yeah...you gotta be careful with that thing.
4,47,Baljeet,And you know this how?
4,47,Candace,"(sighs) When I was at Vanessa's, I may have accidentally intentionally pushed the button."
4,47,All but Ferb,(gasp)
4,47,Candace,"Okay, I was having a rotten day. One crummy thing after another kept happening and when he told me that this thing can make the day start over again, I just couldn't help myself. And then the days just kept looping and I know I should've said something sooner, but I kept coming closer to busting you guys! And I swear I had no idea it would do any of this. I thought I'd get one do-over and that would be that, but then I saw it was creating problems and making things disappear and making people forget, but by the time I tried to stop it, it was too late, and I lost you guys! And I don't know how to fix it!"
4,47,Buford,"Well, if this thing's the problem, maybe we should press this big self-destruct button."
4,47,Baljeet,"NOOOOO! If time stops looping, there will be no big tears in the fabric of space-time and no way for us to get home. We must find a way to get ourselves and that machine through one of the rifts and back into Danville. Then we can push the button and blow up the machine."
4,47,Buford,I call pressing the button!
4,47,Phineas,"Come on, gang! We know what we have to do today!"
4,47,Buford,Yeah. RUUUUUUUNN!!! (The gang runs away.)
4,47,(Song,Gotta Get Back in Time)
4,47,Phineas,"Well, it's not pretty, but we did it."
4,47,Buford,"I dub thee ""The Buford van Stomm Time Catapult"". I won the naming rights fair and square."
4,47,Phineas,"C'mon, guys! No time to lose! How's it lookin', Baljeet?"
4,47,Baljeet,"It looks like the next anomaly will appear any second now. I am working on the exact coordinates, but there is significant interference. It looks like there may be multiple rifts coming."
4,47,Phineas,"As long as we can hit one of 'em. Stand by your hand cranks, people!"
4,47,Baljeet,Here they come!
4,47,Phineas,"It's cars! Baljeet, what are those coordinates?!"
4,47,Baljeet,"Got them! 34 degrees, 10 minutes, 15 seconds north. 15 minutes, zero seconds west."
4,47,Phineas,Launch now!
4,47,Candace,Where is the tear?! Where is the tear?!
4,47,Baljeet,Any second!
4,47,The gang,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"How're ya doin' back there, Perry the Platypus?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Takes care of that. Let's plug this baby in and get her goin'!
4,47,Vanessa,Are you sure it'll work?
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, yeah, absolutely. There's a guaranteed 55% chance of success, so we're...we're good to go."
4,47,Vanessa,"Wait, so there's still a 45% chance that it won't do anything?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Of course not, it's not gonna do nothing. There's also a 45% chance it'll destroy everything in existence."
4,47,Vanessa,"What?! Dad, you have to tell us things like this!"
4,47,Phineas,Is everyone okay?
4,47,Buford,"Aw, my muffins got smashed."
4,47,Candace,Come on! No time to lose! Literally!
4,47,Phineas,"Okay, Baljeet, just to confirm, destroying the machine will put the space-time continuum back to normal."
4,47,Baljeet,Yes. And we need to do it quickly. The time loops are accelerating exponentially and—
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh. We're starting here now. Hey, it has been brought to my attention that I should tell you guys there's a 55% chance this will work, but a 45% chance that it'll destroy reality as we know it."
4,47,Vanessa,What?!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,Absolute worst-case scenario.
4,47,Vanessa,"Okay, what happens if we don't push it?"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"If we do nothing, there's a hundred percent chance that the time pocket will dissolve and it'll destroy every— Y'know, there's a whole illustration I can do with a paper towel and a hook, but I don't have time."
4,47,Vanessa,"Okay, we have to take a moment and think about the—"
4,47,Buford,"Oh, man! That was quick!"
4,47,Phineas,The days must be compressing to this exact point!
4,47,Candace,No time to lose! Move! Move! Move!
4,47,Phineas,"Hurry, guys!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, here's the odds. Save the day: 55%. Destroy the universe as we know it: 45%. But do nothing at all: a hundred percent chance of the end of time. So whadaya say?"
4,47,Vanessa,Whoa.
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Good answer! How 'bout you, Perry the Platypus? Come on, if you got something to say, now's the time."
4,47,Phineas,(offscreen) The time loop is getting too short!
4,47,Buford,(offscreen) What if I throw Baljeet?
4,47,Baljeet,(offscreen) You are just using this as an excuse!
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I gotta tell ya, there's a lot of risk involved, but we've discussed it over, like, three loops already, and I think this is our only option. Are you with me?"
4,47,Vanessa,"Yeah, I am."
4,47,Perry,(thumbs up and chatters approvingly)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I should have just about enough time to press this button if I'm not too overly dramatic about it."
4,47,Phineas,We can't reach it! There's just not enough time!
4,47,Baljeet,D-Did it work?
4,47,Phineas,(gasps)
4,47,Linda,"Okay, kids. Pie's almost ready. Anybody want some fresh orange juice in the meantime?"
4,47,Lawrence,I used a spoon to squeeze them.
4,47,Buford,Orange juice!
4,47,Isabella,Yay!
4,47,Buford,There's the emotional attachment to oranges I've been lackin'! (He gives Isabella a high eight.)
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, we're not destroyed, so that's a good sign."
4,47,Vanessa,"Uh, but did it work?"
4,47,Norm,"Muffin time, sir!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"We are back in business, baby girl! (hugs Vanessa)"
4,47,Vanessa,"Yes! Dad, I'm so proud of you! You did it!"
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, I'd do anything for you, pumpkin pants! After we dismantle this thing, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. I've got no experience being a good guy."
4,47,Vanessa,"Well, I'll stick around and help you figure it out. I hear OWCA is looking for a few good animals."
4,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I was raised by ocelots!"
4,47,Candace,"Now, that was an eventful day!"
4,47,Baljeet,That was an eventful summer.
4,47,Isabella,"What was your favorite part, Phineas?"
4,47,Phineas,Of the summer?
4,47,Isabella,Yeah! What was your favorite thing we built?
4,47,Phineas,Memories.
4,47,Buford,"Oh, come on!"
4,47,Baljeet,"Oh, really corny!"
4,47,Phineas,"No, I'm serious! We've done a lot of great stuff. How can I choose?"
4,47,Buford,Yeah! Remember the time we went into space??
4,47,Baljeet,Which time?
4,47,Buford,The time we made the ice cream! Duh!

4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh",Hopefully.
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"We get letters from kids all over the world asking us questions about the show, that we..."
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","No, that's not actually true. We don't get a lot of actual, physical ""written on paper"" letters..."
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"No, no. That's true... That's true"
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","...what we get is a lot of e-mails. Digital, electronic.."
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"Yeah. Actually, all of the e-mails we've ever received fit on this flash drive right here. (He holds up a flash drive) But that's not as impressive as this... (Dan motions to the large pile of mail sitting behind them)"
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","No, this stack of, of letters here is much more impressive. This is a prop, though made mostly of, uh, foam, fiberglass, that kind of thing."
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"Yeah. Not to say that we don't actually get letters from people. Physical letters. Ih-like, this one, for instance, from– from Becky. This is a question we get all the time. ""Are we ever going to see Perry the Platypus get a girlfriend?"""
4,46,Dan and Swampy,No!
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","No, not gonna happen."
4,46,Dan Povenmire,No.
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","Here's another one. This one is from, uh, Donny. Says: ""Are we ever going to see Phineas and Ferb as teenagers?"""
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"Yes. Yes, we are."

4,46,Dan Povenmire,"This episode is set ten years in the future. So don't let it confuse you. Actually, uh, to avoid confusion, let's, uh, let's just synchronize our calendars right...."
4,46,Dan and Swampy,Now!
4,46,Phineas,"Ugh! I'm running out of time, Ferb. I gotta choose a school. Do I stay local or go abroad? Trade school? Art school? Come on, Ferb. Help me make a decision."
4,46,Ferb,Get in the booth.
4,46,Phineas,"Oh, cool! All my college acceptance letters! I guess we're gonna let fate decide this one."
4,46,Phineas,"(He grabs one) Okay, Kjobstaad Academy. Uh, which one was that again?."
4,46,Ferb,"Mmm...great physics department, Norway."
4,46,Phineas,Hmm...Don't feel I'm ready for those cold winters.
4,46,Phineas,"Okay. Comedy Traffic School. Well, if it's fate..."
4,46,Phineas,"Yeah, things seemed a lot easier when we were young and waiting for our voices to drop."
4,46,Baljeet,"(in a deep voice) Hey, guys. (he coughs and returns to his normal voice) Oh! Something was caught in my throat. So, still trying to figure out where to go to school?"
4,46,Phineas,Workin' on it.
4,46,Baljeet,"I was just giving Buford some pointers on collegiate life. Since I've already graduated and have been accepted as a professor, I could pull some strings and get him into my school. Just think, Buford. You could be my student! I would be the boss of you!"
4,46,Buford,Don't get too excited. I'm goin' to film school. I'm concentratin' on tragedies. The story of a struggling orphan's transcendental search for meaning in a post-apocalyptic society.
4,46,Baljeet,It sounds pretentious.
4,46,Buford,Thank you. (he takes another bite out of his sandwich)
4,46,Baljeet,"So, Ferb, you're off to school in England?"
4,46,Phineas,"Yeah. He's going to Camford on Oxbury. Heh heh! ""Camford on Oxbury"". It sounds like a wizard school."
4,46,Ferb,"It's not a wizard school. Well, there is some wizarding."
4,46,Buford,"Phineas, why don't you just go there?"
4,46,Baljeet,Or why not go where Candace goes to school?
4,46,Phineas,Law school? I don't know.
4,46,Candace,And that concludes my dissertation on modern investigative techniques for establishing proof of guilt with or without physical evidence.
4,46,Male panelist,Spectacular! I've never had a student convince me of something so completely baseless before!
4,46,Female panelist,Now I feel like busting someone.
4,46,Phineas,"Yeah, I don't know if Candace's school is the place for me. Forget the booth. I'm gonna go with my gut. (takes two envelopes) It's between these two: Danville U and Tri-State State. Both really good schools. Looks like I have some thinkin' to do."
4,46,Buford,"Hey, the epic struggle of a triangle-headed boy to choose between two schools."
4,46,Baljeet,Pretentious alert.
4,46,Buford,"And again, thank you."
4,46,Irving,"(on the phone) Sir, it's the old Evil Scientist Alert System! It's showing -inator activity on a Doctor Dooferd–..."
4,46,Commander Carl,"Doofenshmirtz‽ Great googly moogly! I though he'd given up his evil ways when we placed him as a high school science teacher. Well, it's too bad Monogram isn't around to see this."
4,46,Irving,"Well, sir, he's gone to a better place."
4,46,Commander Carl,"Yeah... (beat) Oh, what the heck? I'm gonna call him! (Carl dials the phone. Monogram, now retired and older, with a beard and a Hawaiian shirt is lounging on a beach.)"
4,46,Monogram,Monogram.
4,46,Commander Carl,"How've ya been, sir?"
4,46,Monogram,"Carl! I'm great! Bora Bora really is a better place. How've ya been, man?"
4,46,Commander Carl,I've been well. Guess who's set off the -inator alert?
4,46,Monogram,Doofenshmirtz?
4,46,Commander Carl,Yeah.
4,46,Monogram,"Heh heh. Just like old times. Go tell him ""hi"" for me."
4,46,Commander Carl,Of course.
4,46,Commander Carl,"Agent P... (Agent P picks up his bowling bag.) No, it's not bowling night! It's Doofenshmirtz. He's activated the -inator alert system. We think he may have returned to evil."
4,46,Baljeet,So I hear Isabella is off to Tri-State State.
4,46,Phineas,"Oh, wow, really? Huh. Haven't seen much of her this summer."
4,46,Buford,"(looking in the fridge) Why do parents buy such weird food? Everything's 'lite', 'low', 'non', 'free', or 'diet'."
4,46,Phineas,So she's...leaving?
4,46,Baljeet,"Yes. Huh, I always thought the two of you would end up together."
4,46,Phineas,I wish. I am so in the friend zone there.
4,46,Baljeet,"You are kidding, right? You do know she had a giant crush on you for ages."
4,46,Phineas,Uh...no...
4,46,Buford,"Oh, come on! It was so obvious! She came over to your house every day for eleven years just to see what you were doin'!"
4,46,Baljeet,"When she looked at you, her pupils actually formed little hearts. Like, I do not know how that is physically possible. She changed her eyeballs!"
4,46,Phineas,"We— I don't believe it. Ferb? (Ferb nods.) Well, why didn't you guys ever tell me?"
4,46,Baljeet,We are guys. We do not talk about feelings. (Buford shrugs in agreement) ..Did you see the new car Irving got?
4,46,Buford,Could we eat yet? I'm starvin'.
4,46,Phineas,"Um, I'm sorry. I feel like my brain is broken. I-I gotta think. I'm gonna take a walk. (he leaves) See ya, guys."
4,46,Baljeet,"Hmm...maybe it is not too late. We should try to get them together. You know, before Isabella leaves for school."
4,46,Buford,"(after a beat) Yeah, all right."
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Eh, is it Thursday already? Hmm, well, let me go get my shoes and my ball and then... Wait, where's your stuff? (Perry points to the -inator behind Doofenshmirtz.) Huh? Oh, no that's not evil, so, so I don't think it counts. Oh, wait a minute. Did I set off the -inator alert? Oh, that is so funny. Probably scared the heck out of Commander Carl, huh? Oh, well I-I know it can look intimidating, but there's no reason to be afraid. It isn't evil. It isn't even the -inator. The -inator is this gold chain. Once it's charged, I'm going to put it around my neck, and it will activate the insecurity parts of my brain and trigger a full-blown mid-life crisis. Allow me to explain in song."
4,46,(Song,"""Mid-Life Crisis"")"
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,"♪ All my friends have spray-on tans, ♪"
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,"So just let me get this thing charged up and we'll be on our way. (Doof puts on some shades and covers Perry's eyes and pushes the button and gets the chain.) Ready? (He puts the chain around his neck and gets electrocuted. Perry walks offscreen to get a defibrillator, but Doof comes to when Perry arrives.) Wow, I feel pretty energized! I wanna do something exciting and fun and...and also incredibly stupid! Come on, Perry the Platypus, let's go have an adventure."
4,46,Holly,"Ginger, are you texting Baljeet again?"
4,46,Ginger,"Yeah, we're at odds deciding what movie to see later. He wants to go to the one about that planet and I want to see the one with that guy."
4,46,Adyson,"Well, don't fight about it. Manipulate the situation!"
4,46,Holly,Manip-the-wha-?
4,46,Adyson,"(sighs) Okay, ladies, listen up. Pretend you don't care about your movie, but then hint that it's playing at the theatre next to the fro-yo place he likes. The seed is planted, and he'll think it's his idea to go there."
4,46,Isabella,"Hi, guys! Food's up! Aw, just think, this may be the last time I'm stuffing your faces before I'm off to school. (the phone rings) I got it, Mom! (to the girls) Anyway, enjoy! Gotta treat my Fireside Girl alums right. (she leaves)"
4,46,Ginger,Hey hey! Baljeet says okay to my movie!
4,46,Adyson,Mm-hmm. Works every time.
4,46,Gretchen,Where is Baljeet anyway?
4,46,Ginger,"Oh, he's over at Phineas's."
4,46,Holly and Katie,"Oh, Phineas..."
4,46,Gretchen,It's too bad Isabella and Phineas never got together.
4,46,Holly,"Yeah, I always thought they were meant for each other."
4,46,Adyson,Look at her. Working so hard.
4,46,Isabella,"Do we have chopped liver? What do you think this place is? Chopped li— Oh, that doesn't really work."
4,46,Adyson,She doesn't have time to manipulate a situation where she and Phineas can get together.
4,46,Milly,But we do!
4,46,Adyson,"(to Ginger) Hey, Speedy-Thumbs, text Lover Boy and tell those guys we have a plan to get Isabella and Phineas together!"
4,46,Buford,Ginger texting you again?
4,46,Baljeet,Yes. The girls want to get Phineas and Isabella together.
4,46,Buford,Wasn't that our idea?
4,46,Baljeet,"Yes, but now I've got to write her back in a passive way that makes her think it's really her idea. She is trying to manipulate the situation. (He takes another bite of his sandwich) It is how we love."
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Woo hoo hoo hoo! How's the dye job holding up, Perry the Platypus?! Isn't this great?! If I had known it was this much fun— (Doofenshmirtz smashes into sailboat.) Hey, this is one of those fancy sailing yachts!"

(The boat sinks, and Doof's black hair dye evaporates. He gets back up.) Or maybe we could wrestle some alligators! No, wait, even better, sports car! (He swims to shore, with Perry following.)"
4,46,Phineas,"Here, let me get that for you, Nana Shapiro."
4,46,Nana Shapiro,"Phineas Flynn! Oh, look at you, so tall and handsome! You're going to college I hear! Oh, how time flies. Where're you going to school?"
4,46,Phineas,I haven't really decided.
4,46,Nana Shapiro,Isabella came over to say goodbye this morning. She's off to—
4,46,Phineas,This morning? But her school doesn't start for two more weeks!
4,46,Nana Shapiro,"Oh, honey, didn't you know? She's leaving today! As soon as she's done with work. Something about needing to—"
4,46,Phineas,Today‽ But—
4,46,Nana Shapiro,"Phineas, look at me. If you have anything you need to say to her, you'd better go over to the restaurant and say it. Her summer's almost over."
4,46,Phineas,(a pried pause) I— You're right. Thanks! (he runs off)
4,46,Nana Shapiro,The restaurant is that way! (She points in the diction opposite of where Phineas ran)
4,46,Phineas,Thanks again! (He runs off in the other direction)
4,46,Ginger,Isn't this fun? It's like when we were kids! Building stuff in Phineas and Ferb's backyard!
4,46,Baljeet,"We'll build the perfect dinner date for Isabella and Phineas. Their favorite food, music."
4,46,Adyson,"And when we get them to come back here and see it and each other, they're bound to fall madly in love like they were always meant to be!"
4,46,Ferb,"You know, you can't force these things."
4,46,Adyson,"Oh, come on, we're girls! It's what we do!"
4,46,Gretchen,"When they first walk in, we'll play the songs I put on this playlist. They're all about love, and it will trigger them to start thinking about love. Then we have these streamers and balloons in both of their favorite colors, which will stimulate the romantic centers of their brains making them think about love."
4,46,Katie,What if it doesn't?
4,46,Buford,"Well, then, we have this sign. (He holds up a sign saying: ""Think about love."")"
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,Sure you don't have anything else that's more ridiculous or irresponsible?
4,46,Salesman,Nope. This is as dumb as they come.
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,"All right! (he speeds off) Woohoo! Yeehaw! (Perry gets a worried look, as the car crashes and Doof returns with only the steering wheel.) So, what else ya got?"
4,46,Salesman,"We've got another one just like it, but in yellow."
4,46,Doofenshmirtz,(He gasps) Ya hear that?! It'll be like driving a really fast Ducky Momo!
4,46,Buford,"Oh, yeah, it's the perfect romantic setting out there! It'll be like love kicked 'em both in the face!"

4,46,Buford,No way! I'm not puttin' that stupid cupid costume on again!
4,46,Baljeet,But it worked so well for me and Mishti!
4,46,Ginger,"(jealously) Hoo, Mishti, Mishti, Mishti!"

Oh, it's okay, we're fine! But we do seem to have picked up a passenger! I'll shake it loose up here at the turn. (Doofenshmirtz and Perry turn, while the dumpster continues on.)"
4,46,Vivian,"Now drive safely, sweetheart. And call me when you get to school."

4,46,Phineas,You guys are the best!
4,46,Buford,(dressed as cupid again) So what did I miss?
4,46,Baljeet,It was as if love had kicked them both in the face!
4,46,Buford,Yeah? Called it!
4,46,Isabella,I'm going to miss you guys!
4,46,Isabella,See ya.
4,46,Phineas,In two weeks.
4,46,Isabella,"Eh, I've waited this long."
4,46,Ferb,"So, Tri-State State, huh? Good choice."
4,46,Vanessa,"Hey, Ferbs, you ready? (Ferb gets in the passenger seat and hugs and kisses Vanessa.) Hi, Phineas!"
4,46,Phineas,"Hi, Nessa! Where're you guys goin'?"
4,46,Vanessa,"Oh, Ferb's takin' me out for Ukrainian food."
4,46,Ferb,Can we drop you anywhere?
4,46,Phineas,Hmm... as a matter of fact...
4,46,Isabella,Phineas? (She gets out of the car) What are you doing?
4,46,Phineas,"This. (He kisses her, and she kisses back)"
4,46,Vanessa,I never knew she had a thing for him.
4,46,Ferb,Seriously?
4,46,Vanessa,"(chuckles) Naw, I'm just messin' with you! Everyone knew! (She drives away with Ferb, leaving Phineas and Isabella alone.)"
4,46,Isabella,"Well, that was worth the wait."
4,46,Phineas,Yes. Yes it was. (They kiss again.)
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh",(sobbing) I can't believe it! It seems like only yesterday we were drawing our first doodles of these kids on the place mats of that...
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"(consoling Swampy) Yeah, I, I know, it's a... It's a sweet episode."
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh","Now they're, they're growing up... and going to college..."
4,46,Dan Povenmire,But it's... It is really... It's just a cartoon.
4,46,"Jeff ""Swampy"" Marsh",Why?!
4,46,Dan Povenmire,"Um... Y'know, I gotta thing. I'm gonna... I'm just gonna... (He gets up out his chair and leaves Swampy alone.)"

4,42,Candace,"But, Mom, Stacy and I are this close to kicking leaderboard butt in Ducky Momo's Golden Quest!"
4,42,Linda,"Well, your chores better be done before I get back from running my errands."
4,42,Candace,"No problemo, Mom! You're lookin' at the queen of mul...ti...tas...king!"

4,42,Candace,'Kay! (back on laptop) Ooh! Ooh! Squirrel bandits!
4,42,Phineas,"Ha! You lose, bro! Eye shifts count! Ya moved!"
4,42,Baljeet,"Actually, you did, too. Since our planet's orbit of speed around the sun is 67,000 miles per hour and you are on its surface and speeding around the sun as well. (Buford spins the hat on Baljeet's head.) Quit it!"
4,42,Phineas,"Cool hat, Baljeet!"
4,42,Baljeet,Thank you! I got it at Astro Camp today. (Buford spins it again.) Quit turbocharging the little speed of my solar system!
4,42,Buford,What? I'm racin' 'em against each other. (Spins it again.)
4,42,Phineas,That's it! I know what we're gonna do today!
4,42,Buford,Smack Baljeet's head around?
4,42,Phineas,No! We're gonna build a solar system and race the planets!
4,42,Buford,Only if I can smack around Baljeet's hat!
4,42,Baljeet,"Hey, where is Perry?"
4,42,Major Monogram,"Only you can make the decision to succeed. You've got to dig down deep within yourself and grab ahold of your dream! (pause) Go ahead. Grab it. (beat) I'll wait. (Agent P drops in.) Oh, Agent P! Uh, I've been giving a motivational speech to the interns, and, uh, by ""interns"", I mean Carl."
4,42,Carl,"(offscreen) Very inspirational, sir."
4,42,Major Monogram,"Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has rented out a conference hall at the Danville Motel Inn and is giving some kind of motivational lecture. Who would want motivation from him is beyond me, but, well, that's beside the point. Pick up your credentials at the front desk. (Perry the Chimneypus salutes.) Good luck, Agent P! (Perry's chair lowers back and is launched from it by a spring.)"
4,42,Candace,"I'm all hooked up and ready to multitask. First on the list, wash dishes. (She dusts the table while walking. Sidenote: Don't try this at home.) Now where did we leave off?"
4,42,Stacy,(on laptop) I think we were headed into the forest with the Grizzly King. Are you sure you don't wanna wait until you finished your chores?
4,42,Candace,"Oh, please, Stacy, I've got everything under control. Let's tackle the mountain kings vicious!"
4,42,Isabella,"(offscreen) Hey, Phineas, whatcha doin'?"
4,42,Phineas,Ferb and I were just headin' up to our solar system speedway. We're gonna have a planet race.
4,42,Isabella,Cool!
4,42,Phineas,"The first one to complete 50 laps around the sun wins the Galaxy 5000! Technically, it should be ""The Galaxy 50"", but, y'know, ""The Galaxy 5000"" sounds so much cooler. (Cut to the top level, where Irving is seen at the control panel.) Ferb is racing Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. (Ferb puts on his helmet and gives a thumbs-up and gets sucked up a tube into his racing planet.) I'm racing Mars. I saved Venus for you."
4,42,Isabella,"Aw, because Venus is the goddess of love?"
4,42,Phineas,"(shrugs) Actually, I didn't even think of that. But sure. (Phineas and Isabella put on their helmets and get sucked up the tubes.)"
4,42,Irving,"Alright, racers, status check!"
4,42,Baljeet,"Saturn, check!"
4,42,Buford,"Oo-ran-ohs, check!"
4,42,Baljeet,"Buford, that is not how it is pronounced!"
4,42,Buford,It is on this channel!
4,42,Irving,Venus?

4,42,Irving,Jupiter?
4,42,Django,Check!
4,42,Albert,Pluto is go!
4,42,Irving,Albert?! What are you doing here?! Pluto isn't even a planet!
4,42,Albert,That is still in dispute.
4,42,Irving,"Racers, start your planets!"
4,42,Irving,"What a break! Earth is in the lead, with Jupiter and Neptune rushing up to the challenge, but they take each other out! The Fireside Girls maintain their lead!"

(to audience) You have to excuse me while I confer with my visual aid. (to Perry) I'm on stage, so I'm gonna have to forego the long backstory. Suffice it to say, there was a judge's ruling involved, okay? Anyway, just take a seat in the back and I'll cue you when you're on. (Perry exits) Perry the Platypus, ladies and gentlemen! You'll be seeing more of him later during the nemesis portion of the seminar."
4,42,Candace,"Oh, sweet! We made it to the golden key of Crumblebum Dwarfs!"
4,42,Stacy,"(on laptop) Candace, it's the gopher!"
4,42,Candace,"(not paying attention to how much detergent she's putting in) I'll put a stop to you, you gold key-swipin' gopher!"
4,42,Stacy,"(on laptop) Just get the key! Oh, man!"
4,42,Candace,"Aw, stupid gopher!"
4,42,Stacy,Now we're back to third place!
4,42,Candace,Ugh! I guess we'll just have to get him on the next level. (looks at detergent) Did I put the..? (shrugs) Hmm. (puts in the last of the detergent) Better clean than dirty. (Closes the lid and turns the washing machine on.) I'm one totally focused multitasking genius!
4,42,Irving,"It's a virtual dead-heat with the planetary trine between Mercury, Mars and Venus! Phineas is out in front by a pointed nose! But check out the cool inverted move from Ferb! Watch out, boys! Venus is risin' fast!"
4,42,Ferb,She went intra-Venus right between us.
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, so now that we got the basics covered, we can get to the fun part. Let's start with trapping your nemesis. (Cut to Perry with a nametag lanyard on taking notes. He gets trapped by the lanyard.) Nametag, you're it!"
4,42,Perry,(chatters angrily)
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"The keys to a good trap are the element of surprise and, also, if you can work in a good pun . That's always nice."
4,42,Billy,"Uh, what about constraint and effectiveness?"
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, yeah, th-that'll be covered in the thwarting portion of our seminar. Don't...Don't get ahead of yourself. Okay, step four is the big reveal! (Takes tarp off his inator.) Behold: the Motivate-inator! (The screen behind him says ""Music Sting"", which plays.) The music sting. That totally ups the drama. So what does it do? I'm glad you asked! You, come on up here, I'll sh-I'll show ya. Let's give him a big hand for being such a sport, shall we? (The dude that asked the question in the audience comes up to applause.) Alright, what's your name?"
4,42,Billy,Billy.
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"(shakes Billy's hand) Great to meet ya, Billy! Tell me, (motions toward the back of the room) whadaya see over there in the back of the room?"
4,42,Billy,"Uh...I dunno, a table full of stuff?"
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Did everyone take note of his reply? (walks behind the inator) Totally lackluster. But that's all gonna change. Okay, Billy, now hold still. (Fires the inator on Billy) Now whadaya see, Billy?"
4,42,Billy,"(excitedly gasps) Inator Method merchandise! (runs up to the counter and purchases practically everything) Tapes, DVDs, books, audiobooks, now! Now! T-shirts, hats, that is so cool! I gotta have 'em!"
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,Now look at him! All full of pep! He's completely motivated!
4,42,Man #1,(speaking in a female voice) Wait a second! He's just motivated to buy your junk! This is nothin' but a money-makin' scam!
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Exactly, what better motivation is there? (zaps the entire audience and they storm the merchandise counter)"
4,42,Candace,"Nice work, Stace! That last mega-wallow in the Razzleberry Swamp puts us back in second place. (lets go of the vacuum, which attempts to suck the rug right up)"

4,42,Baljeet,Victory!
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, hold still so I can throw the book at ya! (Perry throws one at him) Ow! (The book hits the inator, which, as always, zaps out the window and hits an unsuspecting driver, who stops outside the backyard and sees the solar system.)"

4,42,Linda,"Hi, kids. Well, at least the backyard isn't a mess."
4,42,Candace,What?!
4,42,Linda,"Come on, Candace, (walks back inside) you have a lot of cleaning up to do."
4,42,Candace,But...but but but...
4,42,Phineas,"Well, that was a lot of interplanetary fun!"
4,42,Buford,"Plus, we made five bucks!"
4,42,Baljeet,We should put that in the bank.
4,42,Buford,At 1% interest?! Are you kiddin'?!
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Noooooo!!!! Ah, man! Now I'm gonna have to use the money I made for repairs and medical bills."
4,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, now, now, wai-wait! (He walks out the building and looks both directions. He then runs and screams as the planetary race track goes by.) AAAaaah!!! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!!!"

4,43,Phineas,"So, how awesome would it be to actually be a rubber ball?"
4,43,Buford,I'm in! Can we shoot Perry with it and bounce him around the backyard like a plat-a-ball?

4,43,Major Monogram,"Anyhoo, today's the unveiling of Danville's new water tower. Mayor Doofenshmirtz is going to be dedicating it tonight at his press conference. We're fairly certain that Doof'll attempt to disrupt the event in some way. Not only is it high profile, but, since it's right next door to Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, it's also extremely convenient. So get out there and stop him from doing whatever it is he is gonna...

4,43,Isabella,"You're right! I should tell Phineas how I feel! Later, girls! Gotta bounce! (jumps out the window and bounces back up) Literally!"
4,43,Vanessa,So I thought we could watch this foreign art film I found. Le Coeur Noir De Douleur et de la Tristesse Douce.
4,43,Dana,Is that the one that's the neo-realistic portrayal of women's angst?
4,43,Heather,"No, that's the other one. This one is about ennui."
4,43,Candace,Don't know if I've seen that one. Is it animated?
4,43,Lacie,"So, Janice..."
4,43,Candace,Candace.
4,43,Lacie,Nice black nail polish. And only on one finger? Rad.
4,43,Candace,"Oh, it's actually a bruise. (chuckles) I slammed it in a drawer. Yeah, I think it's probably gonna fall off soon."
4,43,Birgitte,Did you download the new Young Apparatus album?
4,43,Lacie,"No way. They're sellouts. I'm only listening to Coffin Shadows now. They're so independent, they pay you to download their songs."
4,43,Candace,Hmm. Coffin Shadows? I've never heard of them.
4,43,Lacie,New skirt?
4,43,Birgitte,"Yeah, I turned it inside out, ripped it in half and then sewed it back together."
4,43,Lacie,Get your brother to drive over it a few times. It really weathers it.
4,43,Candace,(chuckles) Wow! You guys know everything.
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello, ladies! I'm here with homemade doonkelberry pie!"
4,43,Vanessa,"Dad, I thought you were going to stay upstairs! I've got the snacks covered."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"But, pookie, I thought you loved the doonkel-boonkel."
4,43,Vanessa,"(takes the pie) Yes, I do love it and thank you, but (closes the door on him) please, Dad."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,A-Are you watchin' foreign films?
4,43,Vanessa,Dad!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,Maybe-Maybe I could join you guys for a lively discussion.
4,43,Vanessa,"Goodbye, Dad."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Y'know, I-I-I-I can't stay anyway. As we speak, my nemesis is upstairs trying to work free from a trap that... So even if...if you wanted me to stay, I, uh... (she shuts the door on him) Bye."
4,43,Candace,"Stacy, this is amazing! I'm at an actual party with cool older girls! They know everything! They're so AHHHH! They're awesome! You've gotta get over here."
4,43,Stacy,"Candace, I am so proud of myself! I think I totally hooked this thing up! It's incredible! It has picture-in-picture-in-picture! I'll be able to watch a show and then another show inside that show and then the first show again inside that one! And I managed to get it down to one clicker! I'm about to give it a whirl! (She points and clicks, but it turns off and on the TV of a neighbor's house behind her.) Hmm. (The neighbor behind her gets up and sees his TV turn on and off again in frustration.) Okay. Maybe there's still a bug or two to fix."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, party's over, Perry the Platy—"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow! Oh! Ah, man! Ah! Uh, not to be high-maintenance or anything, but d-do you mind we could fight a little quieter? Uh, the girls are watching a movie and I don't wanna dis— I didn't mean you to walk away. (Perry comes back with pillows.) I mean we could continue to fight. It's just they're so— (Perry whacks him with a pillow) A pillow fight! Perfect! It's violent and quiet! It is on!"
4,43,(Music,The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss)
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, come on! Do I get to land one or not? (Perry hits him in the face with a pillow.) I take that as a no? (Perry flings Doof and he hits a wall. Doof spits out some feathers.) Talk about ""down in the mouth"". Get it? It's, uh... Ah, whatever. Meet my friends, (holds up couch cushions) Poly and Ester! (He throws ""Poly"" over at Perry.)"
4,43,(Music,Flight of the Bumblebee by Rimsky-Korsakov)
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,(offscreen) Uh-oh! I think it's overheating!
4,43,Roger,The dedication—
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,Run! It's gonna blow!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha! Trapped ya! You'll fall for anything, Perry the Platypus! (mockingly) ""It's gonna blow!"" (normal voice) As if, as if I would know ahead of time when something's going to—"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"That was purely coincidental. But, hey! I hit Roger! Oh, he's gonna be repulsive now!"
4,43,Doof zombie (Roger),(groans)
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,(angrily) I get it. Repulsive. I see. That's just the universe making a joke at my expense!
4,43,Busty Woman,(gasps) What happened to Mayor Doofenshmirtz?!
4,43,Doof zombie (Roger),Lots of me...
4,43,Doof zombie (Melanie),Lots of me...
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me...
4,43,Man 1,No no no! Aaaaah!
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me....
4,43,Phineas,Woohoo!
4,43,Isabella,"Phineas! Hey, Phineas, I need to talk to you!"
4,43,Phineas,Okay.
4,43,Isabella,"No, (stops him from bouncing) I really need to talk to you and I'm just gonna jump right to it! The thing about that Emotional Bravery Patch is that I need to tell you..."
4,43,Mrs. Feyersied,(offscreen) No! No! No! Get away! Aaah!
4,43,Isabella,"Mrs. Feyersied? (to Phineas) One second please. (Isabella runs over, lifts up her belt and instantly changes into her Fireside Girl uniform.) Good evening, ma'am. Fireside Girl Isabella Garcia-Shapiro Troop 46231. What's the emergency?"
4,43,Mrs. Feyersied,Pharmacists! Pharmacists!!!
4,43,Isabella,What does that even mean?
4,43,Phineas,What's everybody running from?
4,43,Baljeet,"Uh, perhaps that?"
4,43,Phineas,(offscreen) Irving?
4,43,Irving,"Hi, guys!"
4,43,Baljeet,"(offscreen) No, that! Over there!"
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me... Lots of me...
4,43,Buford,"Well, that sure wiggles my biscuits."
4,43,"Phineas, Buford and Baljeet",Run!!!
4,43,Buford,What was that?!
4,43,Phineas,"It's...some kind of pharmacist! And if he touches you, you turn into a pharmacist, too!"
4,43,Buford,I can't be a pharmacist! I know nothing about pharmaceuticals!
4,43,Baljeet,Then we gotta make sure those things never touch us!
4,43,Doof zombie,(touches Baljeet) Lots of me...
4,43,Buford,Stay back! You're infected!
4,43,Phineas,"Buford, put me down!"
4,43,Baljeet,I...I am okay! Really!
4,43,Buford,(puts Phineas down) Why are you okay?
4,43,Baljeet,I do not know!
4,43,Ferb,Perhaps our rubberized skin might be acting as an insulator.
4,43,Phineas,Of course! The contagion must be transmitted by electrostatic charge!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,"Let's bounce, guys! (They bounce away. Phineas comes back down.) Literally. (He bounces back up.)"
4,43,Baljeet,How long is the rubberization effect supposed to last?
4,43,Phineas,Not much longer!
4,43,Buford,I wanna recharge!
4,43,Phineas,Good idea! Let's get back to the backyard and re-rubberize!
4,43,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"Good evening, I'm Gordon Gutsofanemu with a special report. The Tri-State Area is in chaos tonight as thousands of repulsive mindless pharmacists run rampant all over Danville!"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, there they go with the whole ""pharmacist"" thing again! I-I should become one, that-that would show 'em! I should become a pharmacist!"
4,43,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"We now go live on the scene with our own Action News reporter, Don Adaded. Don?"
4,43,Don Adaded,"Thanks, Gordon. I'm standing here in downtown Danville. It's an unbelievable scene. Pharmacists touching people who turn into pharmacists. Ah, here's one of them now. Mr. Mindless Repulsive Pharmacist, care to comment?"
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me... (touches Don)
4,43,Don Adaded,"And there you have it, folks. I'm..."
4,43,Doof zombie (Don Adaded),Lots of me...
4,43,Gordon Gutsofanemu,(clearly frightened) Thanks...Don. L-Let's go to the weather.
4,43,Doof zombie (Weatherman),Lots of me...let's go to traffic...
4,43,Doof zombie (pilot),Lots of me...
4,43,Doof zombie (co-pilot),"Back to you, Gordon..."
4,43,Doof zombie (Gordon Gutsofanemu),Lots of me...
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't believe it! An entire army of mes! Heh heh! (runs to the elevator) Oh! For once, I'll actually be able to take over the Tri-State Area 'cause I'll have, you know, the volume. Ciao, baby!"

4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Phineas,Hurry! We're losing our bounce!
4,43,Baljeet,Oh no! The pharmacists trashed the machine! Can we rebuild it?
4,43,Phineas,"We can try, but we should do it inside. There's too many pharmacists out here. Our rubberization is fading fast."
4,43,Buford,(attempts to bounce but falls) I DIDN'T BOUNCE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
4,43,Phineas,(closing the sliding door) Okay. We gotta get started on another rubberization ray.
4,43,Buford,(runs and screams)
4,43,Phineas,Right after we calm down Buford.
4,43,Stacy,"Yes! Next, popcorn."
4,43,Doof zombie,"Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Stacy,"And so begins The Grievance movie marathon. Special edition box set. Oh, yeah. ""Hey, Stacy, didja hook up that whole system by yourself?"" ""Yeah, no biggie. Do it all the time."" Heh heh. I rule."
4,43,Candace,So this is a French film subtitled in Spanish. Why is that lady wearing a goat head?
4,43,Birgitte,Art isn't art unless it's difficult.
4,43,Candace,Mmm-hmm.
4,43,Doof zombie,(growls)
4,43,Lacie,"Hey, Vanessa? Your dad's at the door."
4,43,Vanessa,"Ugh! It's okay, don't pause it. (She opens the door to reveal three Doof zombies behind it.)"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Vanessa,"Okay. (closes door) Something's weird here, because I know I only have one of those. Lemme call him and see what's up. Hmm. Voicemail. Odd. Dad, your weird clone-thingies are down here. Could you please just—"
4,43,Vanessa,Aaaaaahh!!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me... Lots of me... Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Punk girls,Aaaaaaahhh!!! (they run away)
4,43,Vanessa,"Come on, Candace! Come on, come on! Get in! (they run into her bedroom and close the door) Okay, that's really wrong. Even by my dad's standards."
4,43,Dana,"Check it out! (looks at her phone) It's all over the web! This isn't just going on in this building. They're all over town and according to this, if one touches you, you become one of them!"
4,43,Punk Girls,Ewwww!
4,43,Lacie,We're doomed!
4,43,Candace,What's the big deal? I see weird stuff like this all the time.
4,43,Birgitte,I want my mommy!
4,43,Lacie,Life's gonna end and I'm wearing a fake tattoo!
4,43,Heather,"Someone's gotta help us! I mean, we're in danger!"
4,43,Candace,"(through the side of her mouth) What a bunch of babies. (gasps) Wait a minute! Weird situation plus danger equals Phineas and Ferb! Okay, calm down. I'm on it! (dials her phone) Mom? Mom, I want you to check and see if the boys are creating zombies!"
4,43,Linda,"Oh, I love it when teenagers get together and do party pranks! Do you win the game if I actually do what you say?"
4,43,Baljeet,This has taken considerably longer than I have ever imagined!
4,43,Phineas,"Buford, chill out! You're fine!"
4,43,Buford,"Whadaya mean, ""fine""? I've got no bounce left! I'm totally unprotected!"
4,43,Phineas,We'll build another rubberization ray.
4,43,Baljeet,"Yes. It is not as if society has crumbled, Buford. The phone networks are still up."
4,43,Phineas,We still have electric power.
4,43,Baljeet,And water is still flowing out the tap.
4,43,(Correction,Water was still flowing out the tap. Ferb's phone's power gets cut off and the lights all turn out.)
4,43,Buford,(offscreen) Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!
4,43,Candace,"Mom? Mom, are you there? Something weird is going on! Not the usual weird! A different, not-normal weird!"
4,43,Vanessa,This is not my dad's everyday weird either.
4,43,Candace,Something tells me I shoulda just hung out at Stacy's.
4,43,Stacy,(to the TV) Look out! She's right behind you! (the power shuts off) Ugh! You gotta be kiddin' me! Talk about Grievance interruptus. (gets off the couch)
4,43,Linda,I just love blackouts. They're kind of exciting in a way.
4,43,Lawrence,"Yeah, oh, yes. And it's one of the few times you get to meet your neighbors."
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me...
4,43,Lawrence,Like this fellow here. Hello. Pleased to meet you. I'm Lawrence.
4,43,"Doof zombie, Doof zombie (Linda) and Doof zombie (Lawrence)",Lots of me...
4,43,Phineas,"Oh no! They got Mom and Dad! And without power, there's no way to repair the circuits!"
4,43,Buford,"Game over, man! We're doomed!"
4,43,Baljeet,"No! There is always a way! Isabella teaches the emergency preparedness class for the Fireside Girls. She could build a generator in her sleep. Is that not right, Isabella? (who is not here)"
4,43,Phineas,Isabella? I...I thought she was... Didn't anyone... Who saw her last? (He freaks out just like Buford.)
4,43,Buford,"""Buford, chill out. You're fine."" I'm vindicated."
4,43,Man 3,There's no Internet!
4,43,Man 4,I've got to know what's going on!
4,43,Martin the News Vendor,"Yeah! Print is back, baby!"

4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Lots of me... Naw, I'm just kidding! It's...It's me! But those guys are annoying, aren't they? Anyway, welcome to my Startle Space. I wanted a panic room, but it was just prohibitively expensive. I just had to get to a place where I could clear my head, man. Those other mes, they're really workin' my last nerve. ""Lots of me... Lots of me..."" One of me is fine, but, ih, I can really be annoying en masse. I'll admit it. So, uh, are you hungry? I got plenty of food. (Perry takes down a can of almond brittle.) Or maybe you wanna play a game. I got some old Drusselstein board games here, like, ooh, ""Kleptocracy""! Vanessa used to love this game when she was a— (gasps) Vanessa! Oh no! She's still in the building! We need to stop those mes before they get to her or, or she could turn into me! That's every child's worst nightmare! Well, (Stammers) not me, specifically, other children are afraid of turning into me. It's just that I'm saying turning into your parent. That's what's scary. (gasps) Vanessa! Vanessa! (He runs out the door.)"
4,43,Doof zombie,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,(offscreen) I can't believe we left her!
4,43,Phineas,(pacing) I hope she's okay. She's just gotta be! I'm gonna check the periscope again. Maybe she's back by now.
4,43,Baljeet,I will do it.
4,43,Phineas,"Thanks, Baljeet."
4,43,Baljeet,Oh. Nothing but pharmacists as far as the periscope can see.
4,43,Phineas,"Man, I hope she's okay. (sighs) If she's been turned into a pharmacist, I'll never forgive myself."
4,43,Baljeet,"Do not worry, Phineas. With all of her training, she will be fine. Just last week, she earned her Judo, Hapkido, and Jujitsu Patches."
4,43,Phineas,"Judo? Hapkido? But those are all grappling techniques! And if she touches one of them, then... ih... Wait, wait. I bet she's at Fireside Girl Headquarters! We've got to go there!"
4,43,Baljeet,But that is all the way across town!
4,43,Buford,We can't go out there unprotected! We're sittin' ducks!
4,43,Phineas,"Since our rubberization machine is toast, we're gonna need some sort of insulating armor. Hey, Ferb, do we have any rubber lying around?"
4,43,Phineas,"Two steps ahead as always. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do tonight!"
4,43,Stacy,"(scoffs) Figures. The power goes out right in the middle of the movie. Good thing I got the power generator package option. Okay, let's see. (reading manual) ""For your safety, please make sure to wear included protective gear when operating the generator."""
4,43,Stacy,"Great! Here we go! (A Doof zombie attempts to stalk behind her, but she pulls the chord and unintentionally punches the zombie unconscious.) Nice! Hooked up a video system and a generator! I am good!"
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me...
4,43,Shaun,"Don't touch me! I don't want to be a pharmac—! Wait a second... That doesn't even make sense. You get touched by a pharmacist, you become a pharmacist? I mean, you can't just grow a lab coat."
4,43,Ed,"I don't know, perhaps the disease infects your clothin' as well."
4,43,Shaun,Infects my c— Are you insinuating that my clothes are alive? That's scarier than these pharmacist saying... (gets touched and transforms)
4,43,Doof zombie (Shaun),Lots of me...
4,43,Ed,"Oh, I s'pose I didn't really think that through. (gets touched and transforms)"
4,43,Doof zombie (Ed),Lots of me...

4,43,Major Monogram,"Agent P! (static) Agent P! Do not come— (static) —headquarters! It is— (static) —life-or-Doof situation! (static) O.W.C.A. has fallen! I repeat, O.W.C.A. has— (Crash!) (static) Agent P, we need you to find the source of the contagion and protect those who haven't been infected. You're our last hope."
4,43,Carl,You're the Omega Platypus! But no pressure! Oh!
4,43,Major Monogram,"(transforming) Good luck, Agent P. Good—"
4,43,Doof zombie (Major Monogram),Lots of me... Lots of me...
4,43,Doof zombie (Carl),Lots of me... I used to be Carl...
4,43,Phineas,"Okay, guys. Fireside Girls Headquarters is only a couple of blocks away."
4,43,Phineas,"Whoa! Look alive, boys!"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Buford,"Oh, hey, it's a dog. Here boy! (whistles)"
4,43,Doof zombie (Agent G),Baaa...

4,43,Phineas,What the?
4,43,Doof zombie (Agent M),(screeches)
4,43,Phineas,Oh no! The contagion must have a different effect on animals!
4,43,Phineas,They're following us!
4,43,Buford,"Hold on! I'll try to lose 'em! Feet up, Ferb!"
4,43,Phineas,Looks like we lost 'em!
4,43,Buford,Yes and no! Aaaaaaahhhh!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Vanessa! Vanessa! Alright, alright, party's over! I've had it up to here with you mes! Y'know, I'm really getting sick of the sound of my own voice. Now I understand where Charlene was coming from."
4,43,Doof zombies,"(crowding Doof) Lots of me... Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
4,43,Doof zombies,Less of me... Less of me... Less of me...
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, typical. Typical. Yeah, turn on your creator. You guys are all cliché, I'm just letting you know!"
4,43,Candace,That should hold 'em.
4,43,Vanessa,"Okay, guys, we gotta figure out a plan."
4,43,Birgitte,We should totally split up!
4,43,Lacie,I'm gonna go hide in the bathroom where it's safe.
4,43,Dana,I know. I'll run off to check an obscure noise in the kitchen!
4,43,Heather,I'm gonna slowly walk backwards into a dimly lit room.
4,43,Candace,"Really? See, if they watch more domestic horror films, they'd know..."
4,43,Lacie,(groans offscreen)
4,43,Vanessa,Lacie? Are you okay? (walks up to the bathroom door)
4,43,Lacie,Oh. Yeah.
4,43,Vanessa,Feeling safer in there?
4,43,Lacie,(stoic) L-Lots.
4,43,Vanessa,Cool.
4,43,Candace,Wait a minute.

4,43,Candace and Vanessa,Run!

4,43,Doof zombie,(touching them) Lots of me...
4,43,Punk girls,(gasping)
4,43,Dana,Aaiiiiieeee!
4,43,Doof zombies (Punk girls),Lots of me...
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Giant Floating Doofy Zombie Head (Giant Floating Baby Head),Lots of me...
4,43,Gretchen,"Katie, bar the door. (Katie does so) Is she back yet?"
4,43,Holly,No sign of her yet. We've searched everywhere.
4,43,Milly,Where could she be?
4,43,Gretchen,She's probably still with Phineas and Ferb. She'll make it.
4,43,Adyson,Perimeter alert! We have incoming.
4,43,Gretchen,"Stations, everyone! (to Ginger) Put out that light. (Ginger does so) Katie?"
4,43,Katie,Yup. (turns to the door) Friend or pharmacist?
4,43,Phineas,"(behind door) It's us, let us in! (Katie opens the door; Phineas, Ferb, Baljeet and Buford enter)"
4,43,Adyson,It's Phineas and Ferb!
4,43,Ginger,And Baljeet.
4,43,Phineas,"Isabella, are you here?"
4,43,Gretchen,(gasps) We thought she was with you.
4,43,Adyson,Isabella's still out there?
4,43,Buford,"I toldja, man! She's probably wearin' a lab coat by now!"
4,43,Phineas,It can't be!
4,43,Baljeet,"I am afraid Buford is right, Phineas."
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me... (chatters teeth like Perry)
4,43,Baljeet,The odds of anyone surviving out there for this long—
4,43,Phineas,"If anyone can do it, Isabella can!"
4,43,Buford,"It doesn't matter anyway! Sooner or later, they're gonna figure out we're in here and then they're gonna come in here! They're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in here and they're gonna come in here and they're gonna—"
4,43,Gretchen,"(slaps Buford) Lock it down, solider! No one is gonna get in here, ya hear me?!"
4,43,Buford,I am so in love with her right now.
4,43,Phineas,"Okay, I'm running out of ideas. I don't know where she could be."
4,43,Isabella,I'm right here.
4,43,Phineas,Isabella! I'm so sorry we lost track of you.
4,43,Isabella,There's no time! We have a job to do!
4,43,"Adyson, Ginger and Gretchen",(infatuated) OooooOOOooooh!
4,43,Isabella,"We may be the only non-pharmacists left in Danville. I think I figured out where this started. And if we could get there, we might be able to figure out how it started and reverse it."
4,43,Phineas,Wait. How did you find out where it started?
4,43,Isabella,"(uncapping a marker) Well, I'm glad you asked."

4,43,Phineas,"Huh, that building looks familiar."
4,43,Phineas,"Oh. I guess that's why. Y'know, it might be a good idea to board that window."
4,43,Katie,Oh! So that's why there was so much wood left over.
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me... Lots of me...
4,43,Katie,And I definitely should have closed the window! (gets grabbed by the other Fireside Girls) Eeee!
4,43,Phineas,Now what?
4,43,Isabella,We've gotta make our way to that building! I'm sure we'll find our answers there!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Gretchen,Where're they going?
4,43,Isabella,Doesn't matter. They're distracted. Let's move!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Doof Zombie (Pinky the Chihuahua),(growls)
4,43,Candace,In here!
4,43,Vanessa,Ugh!
4,43,Candace,Phew!
4,43,Candace,What's going on with your dad?
4,43,Vanessa,I don't know. His schemes aren't normally this successful.
4,43,Candace,Wait! Phineas and Ferb!
4,43,Vanessa,I'm pretty sure this was not them.
4,43,Candace,"No, I know. But they'll know what to do about it. (banging on the door) Come on! Come on! Let's move!"
4,43,Vanessa,I'm right behind ya!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Isabella,We made it!
4,43,Buford,"Not a pharmacist in sight. Now's as good a time as any to rush in blindly, don't you think?"
4,43,Phineas,"Okay, guys. Let's go...quietly."
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me...,etc."
4,43,Isabella,Here they come!
4,43,Baljeet,They are all over the place!
4,43,Phineas,Come on! Let's go!
4,43,Baljeet,(screams)
4,43,Buford,Sanctuary!
4,43,Isabella,(gasps)
4,43,Doof zombie (Gretchen),Lots of me...
4,43,Isabella,No! No!
4,43,Isabella,I'm going back for them!
4,43,Phineas,You can't help them now!
4,43,Phineas and Isabella,(scream)
4,43,Phineas,Quick! Find something to block this door!
4,43,Buford,It ain't gonna be easy without ruinin' the feng shui of the lobby.
4,43,Phineas,Hurry! (A zombie rips his sleeve.) I'm exposed!
4,43,Isabella,"Phineas, use this! (Tosses the Emotional Bravery Patch to him.)"
4,43,Phineas,(catches the patch) Thanks! (He covers the rip with the patch.)
4,43,Phineas,"Nice work, bro! Thanks, Isabella! Are you all right?"
4,43,Isabella,I'm all right.
4,43,Phineas,"Buford, you okay?"
4,43,Buford,I'm okay? (to Baljeet) You okay?
4,43,Baljeet,I am fine.
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me...
4,43,Baljeet,(gasps and screams as he transforms)
4,43,Buford,BALJEET!!!!
4,43,Baljeet,Lots of...
4,43,Doof zombie (Baljeet),...me...
4,43,Buford,(takes off his clown mask) That's it!
4,43,Phineas,"Buford, what are you doing?"
4,43,Buford,"Look, I just lost my nerd! I'm not gonna lose the rest of my friends, too! (takes off his rubber duckies)"
4,43,Phineas,"But, Buford, that's—"
4,43,Buford,"(stripping down to his underdrawers) Come on, you freaks! Fresh meat! (screams) Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks! Yippee-ki—"
4,43,Buford,(offscreen) Lots of...
4,43,Doof zombie (Buford),...me...
4,43,Phineas,"Y'know, he really could've been bait without taking his clothes off."
4,43,Isabella,"Uh, yeah."

4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, need a ride? (a rope ladder drops down from the chopper) Oh, oh, oh, wait, I should've said, ""Need a lift?"" That's what— I totally missed it."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"It's much safer up here, huh? You might still wanna buckle up, though. It's my first time flying a helicopter."
4,43,Phineas,That'll hold for now. But we gotta move before—
4,43,Phineas,"Really?! Come on, guys! Head for the stairs!"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,(attempts to open the stairway door) It's locked!
4,43,Isabella,Now what?!
4,43,Phineas,Any ideas?
4,43,Isabella,I got nothin'!
4,43,Phineas,Ferb?
4,43,Ferb,I'm petrified beyond all capacity for rational thought.
4,43,Phineas,Candace?

4,43,Candace,Phineas!
4,43,Isabella,Enough! We have to get upstairs!
4,43,Candace,No way! The whole upstairs is crawling with ph—
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Candace,Stairwell it is! What's with the rubber?
4,43,Phineas,It insulates against the infection.
4,43,Candace,I don't even wanna know how you figured that one out.
4,43,Stacy,"No! Don't walk into the kitchen, Grievance lady! Ohhh! Gosh! How could she be so oblivious?"
4,43,Phineas,Just...keep...climbing...
4,43,Candace,(panting) This is enough cardi...cardio...to last me a lifetime.
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Man, I've had off days before, but this is a lulu, even for me. I-I never thought I could get so sick of myself. Oh, well. You know, at least with a disaster of this proportion, things can't get any worse."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, Perry the Platypus, when you get a minute, grab the controls, would you, please?"
4,43,Vanessa,"This is it, my dad's floor."
4,43,Candace,Thank goodness.
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Vanessa,"Whoa, this place is crawling with them."
4,43,Isabella,(pointing to the destroyed inator) There it is! That must be where the ray came from!
4,43,Candace,Ugh! If only there was a way to get rid of all those zombies.
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of...
4,43,Vanessa,Strange and unusual.
4,43,Candace,Same old same old. Come on!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"(coughs) Oh, I sure hope the poor slob who lives here has insurance. That would be... (He looks around to see he is ""the poor slob who lives here"".) Oh, crud. Vanessa!"
4,43,Vanessa,"Dad! (runs up to him for a hug) It's you! Okay, so what did you do?"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it was just a simple Repulse-inator, y'know to, to make Roger ugly, but then, there was some sort of power surge and this happened!"
4,43,Phineas,"(tinkering with the inator) Well, that explains the electromagnetic charge that's changing everybody. But we need some kind of conductor that neutralizes it."
4,43,Isabella,"Well, water neutralizes static."
4,43,Phineas,Yes! Water should change everyone back!
4,43,Vanessa,"Um, isn't that a bit of a leap?"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"No, I'm a scientist. I'm gonna go with 'im on that. I might have a water pistol lying around. I-I can go get it."
4,43,Phineas,"Yeah, but we've gotta find a way to get everyone in Danville wet at once. Otherwise, the contagion could start again."
4,43,Isabella,We can wait till it rains.
4,43,Candace,Oh! We don't have time! And when does it ever rain here?
4,43,Phineas,"Unfortunately, the water went out with the power. So we need to find a large supplier of water. Preferably elevated so that gravity can work in our favor."
4,43,Phineas,"Yeah, I know. We just need to build a pulley system to get us over there and some sort of giant sprinkler to spray the whole city."
4,43,Vanessa,There's always lots of spare parts laying around here.
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,I like to tinker.
4,43,Phineas,Let's get to work!
4,43,(Montage,"The gang all begin working on the pulley system and everything else. At one point, Doof suggests a self-destruct button, but Phineas refuses it.)"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, fellas, I think you might wanna hurry up."
4,43,Phineas,You guys hold 'em off! And don't forget to rubber up!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,(doing a karate yell and wearing rubber gloves on his arms and head)
4,43,Vanessa,"Dad, why are you wearing that? Aren't you immune?"
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, everyone else was dressing up."
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,"That's it! Everything's built! Let's go over the plan. (They take out scale models.) One: Ferb shoots the grappling hook, which attaches to the service platform of the water tower. Two: We send the vortex sprayer up the line. Three: We all ride up in the basket lift. Four: Once we reach the tower, I'll climb into the top of the tank..."
4,43,Candace,Talk faster!
4,43,Phineas,"...and open the hatch. Five: Isabella will attach the connecting claw to the open hatch, which will move the vortex sprayer into place."
4,43,Vanessa,"(offscreen) Phineas, we can't hold them much longer!"
4,43,Phineas,"Whoever makes it to the vortex sprayer first presses that button to activate it! (Breathes) Alright, any questions?"
4,43,Candace,"Yeah, was it worth the time it took to build a scale model?"
4,43,Phineas,"Totally. Anyone else? Yeah, you in the back?"
4,43,Doof zombie,Lots of me...
4,43,Vanessa,"Hurry up, guys!"
4,43,Vanessa,"Great shot, Ferb!"
4,43,Candace,"Vanessa, behind you! (gets touched and transforms) Oh, crud. Lots of..."
4,43,Doof zombie (Candace),...me...
4,43,Phineas,Candace!
4,43,Doof zombie (Candace),Lots of me...
4,43,Phineas,NOOOOOOOO!!!!
4,43,Isabella,"Come on, guys! We gotta go!"
4,43,Phineas,Hurry!
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, man, what I wouldn't give for that single-minded focus. Hey, what's that over there?"
4,43,Doof zombie (Perry),(chatters) Lots of me...
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,No! Not Perry the Platypus!!
4,43,Vanessa,There's too many of them! Dad?! (gets touched and transforms)
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,No! Not Vanessa!!!
4,43,Doof zombie (Vanessa),Lots of me?
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! (takes off his gloves) That's it! That's it! That's it! (takes off his lab coat and shirt) I've had enough of you mes! (Doof is now in his underdrawers.) Alright, you freaks! Fresh meat! Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks! Yippee-ki-yay!"
4,43,Phineas,Again with the clothes.
4,43,Isabella,I know. What's that all about?
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,(offscreen) This is yet another callback to something I didn't hear!
4,43,Isabella,Wow! Look at that! We may be the only ones left.
4,43,Isabella,Oh no! The line's breaking! We're not gonna make it!
4,43,Phineas,"We have to! If we don't make it, Danville falls!"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,Is everyone all right?
4,43,Isabella,I'm good!
4,43,Phineas,"And there's the vortex sprayer! C'mon, let's go!"
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Phineas,We're not gonna make it!
4,43,Ferb,No. You and Isabella will make it. (He charges into the zombies.)
4,43,Phineas,Ferb! No!
4,43,Ferb,(grunts)
4,43,Phineas and Isabella,Ferb!
4,43,Doof zombie (Ferb),Lots of me...
4,43,Isabella,Phineas! No! Don't touch him!
4,43,Phineas,Ferb! I can't just...
4,43,Isabella,I know! But the only way to save him is to keep going! Come on!
4,43,Doof zombies,"Lots of me..., etc."
4,43,Isabella,Phineas! Aaah!
4,43,Phineas,"Hang in there, Isabella! We're almost there!"
4,43,Isabella,"It's just...If this is the end, there's something I have to tell you!"
4,43,Phineas,"Okay, shoot."
4,43,Isabella,For the longest time...
4,43,Phineas,C'mon! There it is!
4,43,Isabella,"But, Phineas, Phineas... I LIKE YOU!!"
4,43,Phineas,"I like you, too, Isabella!"
4,43,Isabella,No! I mean I like-you like you!
4,43,Phineas,"Wow. I mean, gosh. I...I...I've always felt..."
4,43,Isabella,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
4,43,Phineas,Get away from her!
4,43,Isabella,Phineas! No! Ah! No!
4,43,Phineas,(Grunting)(transforming and giving her a clamp) Go! LLLLL....
4,43,Doof zombie (Phineas),Lots of me...
4,43,Isabella,"Oh, Phineas! (sniffles) Get it together, Fireside Girl! It's up to you to save Phineas! (climbs up the tower) It's up to you to save Danville! It's up to you... (Realizes what she is doing) to stop talking to yourself!"
4,43,Isabella,Aaah! (grunting) Got...to...Go! (She presses the button successfully but still transforms and grunts) Lots of...

4,43,Roger,Is the ceremony over?
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of...
4,43,Major Monogram,"Carl, why are we holding our arms like this?"
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me...
4,43,Buford,I dunno what happened here and I'm pretty sure I don't want to.
4,43,Doof zombies,Lots of me...
4,43,Shaun,I still say this makes no sense at all.
4,43,Ed,"I know, right?"
4,43,Vanessa,"Oh, hey there, Candace. You okay?"
4,43,Candace,"Oh, yeah, totes. Just hangin' out, rockin' the wet lo— Oh, who'm I kidding? Look at me."
4,43,Vanessa,"Well, you're pretty cool under pressure."
4,43,Candace,You weren't so bad yourself.
4,43,Vanessa,Thanks. It was good hanging with you. We should do it again sometime. Preferably without the threat of a zombie apocalypse.
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,I'm not makin' any promises.
4,43,Candace,"Well, see you around. (she leaves)"
4,43,Vanessa,"Definitely. Come on, Dad. Let's go play a game of Kleptocracy."
4,43,Doofenshmirtz,That's my girl.
4,43,Phineas,Isabella. Are you okay?
4,43,Isabella,Yeah. Just a little foggy.
4,43,Phineas,What happened?
4,43,Isabella,"I remember building the vortex sprayer, but after that, I've got no clue."
4,43,Phineas,"Me neither. But whatever happened, it worked!"
4,43,Ferb,Yes. Everyone seems to be noticeably lab coat free.
4,43,Phineas,At least everyone within the walled city of Danville.
4,43,Isabella,"(offscreen) Yeah, too bad about the rest of civilization."

4,41,Phineas,And how do they get the red and blue toothpaste to swirl?
4,41,Phineas,"Whoa. Hmm. Apparently, it just fell out of the sky."
4,41,Phineas,"Well, I guess it's the only one. Let's open it up and see what's inside."
4,41,Phineas,"Wow. It's a day full of questions. First the toothpaste, and now this."
4,41,Ferb,"And of course, ""where's Perry?"""
4,41,Phineas,Yeah! See what I mean? We're up to our armpits in enigmas!
4,41,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Glad you're here. Doofenshmirtz has been incommunicado for far too long. Either he's up to something big or he's met with some sort of foul play. (Perry leaves his seat) Man, that was rather abrupt. You know, sometimes, I feel like he just comes here to get his assignments."
4,41,Phineas,"Aw, crud. It's the third battle ax I've broken on this thing. Sorry about that, Dumpy."
4,41,Dumpamir,The name is Dumpamir!
4,41,Baljeet,Wow! The fact that we cannot open it makes discovering the contents that much more tantalizing!
4,41,Phineas,"I know, right? Luckily, Ferb has been working on a special z-ray machine that can see through any substance on the periodic table. It's highly experimental so you might want to encase yourself in this lead body armor."
4,41,Ferb,"Well, we can't see into the capsule, but your second molar has a cavity. And it looks like Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro is making kreplach tortillas."
4,41,(cut to,)
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,(A shadowy figure grabs him and he screams)
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,Hey! That's my lunch!
4,41,Phineas,I think I'm actually running out of ideas here.
4,41,Isabella,And pianos.
4,41,Baljeet,Should I go get a pipe organ?
4,41,Buford,I know the secret of how to open that hatch!
4,41,Phineas,You do?
4,41,Buford,"I do! You see, for generations and generations, the Van Stomm family has been the guardian of the secret knowledge and protectors of the mystery capsule. We made the thirteenth-century Templars look like a bunch of wusses. And throughout the ages, our family has pledged our lives to conceal it from the unenlightened. And in doing so, we were entrusted with the only key that can unlock the capsule secrets."
4,41,Baljeet,Really?
4,41,Buford,"Nah, just messin' with ya. I found it on the other side of the fence. I saw it fall out of the lock when the capsule dropped from the sky."
4,41,Phineas,It's worth a try.
4,41,Major Monogram,"Nice work, Agent P. Carl's analyzing the footprint sample you pulled from Doof's living room as we speak."
4,41,Carl,We've analyzed the mud and there seems to be a large number of caffeine molecules in there. Along with some rain water.
4,41,Major Monogram,So our only leads are coffee and the rainy climate. That could be anywhere!
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, hello! Anyone there? Marco! Y-you're supposed to say Polo! There better be a satisfying explanation for this when it's over or I'm gonna be merciless on my blog!"
4,41,Phineas,"Yeah, baby!"
4,41,Baljeet,What mysteries does it contain? (gasps) Perhaps dozens of stray Schrödinger's cats!
4,41,Buford,But I ain't cleaning that litter box.
4,41,Baljeet,Why is it smoking like that?
4,41,Buford,And why are we all tilted?
4,41,Irving,"Whoops, sorry!"
4,41,Crazy Old Man,You understand what you've done?
4,41,Phineas,Who are you?
4,41,Crazy Old Man,I'm you! From the future!
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasps) Peter the Panda? Oh, that was a good shot of me. Oh, and that one. That one, too. And that one, that one was terrible, my nose looked all crooked, eh, it needed scribbling on it."

4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello, inky shape hovering in the darkness, what gives?"
4,41,Shadowy Figure,"It is I, Professor Mystery."
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,Okay.
4,41,Professor Mystery,Peter the Panda never mentioned me?
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"No, but he doesn't actually, you know, talk. So, you gonna tell me why you kidnapped me? (no response) Um, hello! I know you're still out there. I can see your eyeballs. What's with all the silence? It's very off putting."
4,41,Professor Mystery,Mystery...is my allure.
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,Oh. This is gonna be a fun conversation.
4,41,Phineas,Wait a minute. You're me from the future? What happened to my nose?
4,41,Crazy Old Man,"Never mind about our nose...es. Listen to that. If that hamster stops running, the black hole will break containment, reality will collapse, and now you've exposed my hamster to atmosphere! It's only a matter of time before he weakens!"
4,41,Baljeet,"Wait, you have a hamster that's allergic to air?"
4,41,Crazy Old Man,You must believe me!
4,41,Baljeet,Why?
4,41,Crazy Old Man,Because I'm you from the future!
4,41,Baljeet,"Wait, I am not Indian in the future?"
4,41,Crazy Old Man,'Kay! (to Isabella) I'm you from the future.
4,41,Isabella,That doesn't even make sense.
4,41,Old Woman,Stop telling people you're them from the future!
4,41,Phineas,Who's that?
4,41,Crazy Old Man,That's just Denise. Ignore her. She's no one from the future.
4,41,Denise,"I heard that! Hi, kids. Sorry for the intrusion."
4,41,Crazy Old Man,There's no time to lose!
4,41,Denise,"Settle down, Bernie! Remember your blood pressure!"
4,41,Bernie,What did I tell you? It's happening. He's slowing down!
4,41,Denise,"Oh, let him! I'm so tired of that hamster runnin' our lives!"
4,41,Phineas,What's that flashing?
4,41,Baljeet,That cannot be good.
4,41,Buford,"Well, you did hit it with a lot of pianos."
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously though, what's with the kidnapping? And why do you have an obsessive shrine to Peter the Panda?"
4,41,Professor Mystery,Because I am Peter the Panda's nemesis.
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,(gasps)
4,41,Professor Mystery,You're surprised?
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Well yeah, of course. But come on, if I knew he had a nemesis. I would never want to be the other evil scientist. (sees Professor Mystery's -inator) Ooh! An inator! So what does it do?"
4,41,Professor Mystery,I can't divulge that because mystery...
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"...is your allure. Yeah, yeah, I know. So do you tell Peter the Panda your plans before or after you trap him? It's just...I'm always interested in process."
4,41,Professor Mystery,I don't tell him at all. It would ruin the mystery...which is my—
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,"But he's your nemesis! He's gotta know what he's thwarting! I mean, it's just common courtesy! What, you expect him to infer it from your complicated backstories? (Mystery simply walks away.) Wait, don't—Oh, no. Don't tell me that you've never even given him a backstory! Well, there's your problem! There's your problem right there!"
4,41,Professor Mystery,What?
4,41,Doofenshmirtz,Lack of communication. Gimme a beat. (A beat is somehow given and chorus girls appear out of nowhere.)

4,41,Buford,"Yeah, you're welcome, people."
4,41,Professor Mystery,"So, my own parents accidentally created a black hole and became obsessed with containing it, eventually firing themselves into orbit for fear that they would jeopardize the planet, but they abandoned me in the process. That is what motivated me to become evil in the first place and, eventually, build my unexist-inator, which you destroyed tonight! Wow, it really feels great to tell someone all this!"

4,41,Bernie,What? I was just wondering.

4,41,Polar bear (with Lawrence's voice),"Oh, jolly good, boys. I am a bit peckish."

I thought maybe you had a little extra lying around— (Bumps into a couple of Stormtroopers) Okay, uh, good talk."
4,40,C-3PO,"(offscreen) Please, Master Luke took off your restraining bolt, now quit complaining. (Cut to inside.) Now I'm taking another oil bath. And I don't want to be disturbed. (goes down an elevator platform) Ahhh."
4,40,Phineas,"Wow, that bantha took a while longer to clean than I thought it would. Well, we better get home."
4,40,Phineas,Whoa!
4,40,R2-D2,(beeps)
4,40,Phineas,"Whoa, little fella. Sorry about that. Say, what's a droid like you doing out here in the Jundland Wastes?"
4,40,R2-D2,(beeps)
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, cool! A movie."
4,40,Leia hologram,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope."
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, she must mean Ben Kenobi. Hey, we were just there! We have Jedi lessons with him every Tuesday. He lives right up at the edge of the Dune Sea. Do you want a ride?"
4,40,R2-D2,(beeps no)
4,40,Phineas,"Okay, suit yourself. (R2 leaves) And remember, sand people hide single file to hide their numbers. (to Ferb) Oh, he probably already knows."
4,40,Tusken Raider,(growls)
4,40,Tusken Raiders,(cheer)
4,40,Major Hologram,"Ah, Agent P, our sources tell us that the R2 unit is safely in the possession of Obi-Wan Kenobi. You always come through for us. (Perry smiles nervously knowing that this isn't the case.) Great work! Now to take a well-deserved rest. (Hologram disappears. Agent P smiles and takes out a hanky to dry his sweat when his communicator activates again.) Agent P, I've got your next mission. You need to get to the Death Star immediately. Darthenshmirtz is working on a new inator. We need you to stop him before he can finish building it. Good luck."
4,40,Phineas,"Okay, Mom! See ya later!"
4,40,Linda,(offscreen) Don't forget your two-sun sunscreen.
4,40,Phineas,"Way ahead of ya, Mom! Hey, what's this? ""Death Star plans""? Wait, I bet it belongs to that R2 unit that we sent to Ben Kenobi's house. I wonder if he's still there."
4,40,Ferb,No. He is on his way to Mos Eisley.
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, wow! Can you sense that with the Force?"
4,40,Ferb,"No, I can see them. They're right over there."
4,40,Phineas,"(offscreen) You're right, Ferb. And Luke's with them! Inside a—"
4,40,Tusken Raider,(growls)
4,40,Phineas,"Whoa! (cut to reveal it's only Ferb playing with a puppet) Oh, you got me!"
4,40,Ferb,(speaks Tusken and plays with the puppet)
4,40,Blatto,Phineas and Ferb! My best customers!
4,40,Phineas,"Hey, Blatto, we're trying to find an R2 unit and give him back this data disc. (Blatto takes the disc.) Hey!"
4,40,Blatto,Let's take a look at it. (He puts it into an R2 unit's head and it shows a hologram of the Death Star.)
4,40,Phineas,"Wow! It's an Imperial battle station the size of a moon! And according to these schematics, it seems to be designed specifically to destroy entire planets! Whoa, I-I never imagined the Empire would go that far! (Ferb points) Huh, you're right, Ferb. One proton torpedo in that small exhaust port and the whole thing goes blammo!"
4,40,Blatto,"Uh, it's like it's got a self-destruct button. What kind of idiot would design that?"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Oh, why can't I master this?"
4,40,Phineas,"Wait, if the Rebels have this information, they might stand a chance against this thing. A small one-man fighter could penetrate the outer defense, fly along that trench, and get to the exhaust port."
4,40,Blatto,"Hey, spoiler alert!!"
4,40,Phineas,That droid must be part of the Rebel Alliance! We've gotta get this disc back to him!
4,40,Baljeet,"Candace, did you get the socks?"
4,40,Candace,Mission accomplished.
4,40,Buford,I gotta hoagie!
4,40,Baljeet,Are those the stolen Death Star plans we are not supposed to be looking for?
4,40,Candace,"I don't believe it! (to Phineas and Ferb) Hey, you with the Death Star plans, you guys are so busted!"
4,40,Phineas,Uh-oh! Let's get outta here!
4,40,Buford,And they're lost in the crowd.
4,40,Candace,Not on my watch! Let's go!
4,40,Phineas,"Hey, look! There's the droid!"
4,40,Candace,"You two, stop right there! (Buford fires his blaster again) Buford!"
4,40,Buford,"Sorry, my bad!"
4,40,Random Guy,(offscreen) My watermelon!
4,40,Phineas,There's the droid! Let's get over there!
4,40,Stormtrooper 5,Stop that ship! Blast 'im!
4,40,Han,"Chewie, get us outta here!"
4,40,Chewbacca,(roars)
4,40,Phineas,Maybe we came at a bad time.
4,40,Stormtrooper 6,"Oh, crud, this is going to mean nothing but paperwork."
4,40,Phineas,"If we don't get these plans to that R2 droid, entire planets could be destroyed. C'mon, we gotta find a pilot and follow that ship."
4,40,Cantina MC,"(offscreen) Alright, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes! (Cut to inside the cantina where the band is leaving) Not a bad set, guys. Only one death and one dismemberment. Not bad for a Wednesday."
4,40,Ponda Baba,(speaks Aqualish)
4,40,Cornelius Evazan,I don't like him either.
4,40,Cantina MC,"(offscreen) Alright, let's give 'er a big cantina welcome, folks, Vanessa the Twi'lek."
4,40,Phineas,"(to the bartender) Um, we're looking for a pilot."
4,40,Bartender,Over there.
4,40,Nurse,"Someone said he shot first, but I coulda sworn it was the other guy."
4,40,Bartender,Nope. There.

4,40,Phineas,"I'm Phineas and this is my brother, Ferb. We understand you're a pretty good pilot."
4,40,Isabella,For a price.
4,40,Phineas,"Well, we have a very important disc we need to get to someone who just blasted out of Docking Bay 94."
4,40,Isabella,I know whose ship that is.
4,40,Phineas,Whose?
4,40,Isabella,Han Solo.
4,40,Vanessa,♪ So low... ♪
4,40,Isabella,"Solo's been a thorn in my side for years. My ship, the Centennial Chihuahua, was on pace to finish the Kessel Run in eleven parsecs, and that nerf-herder cut me off!"
4,40,Vanessa,♪ I'm feelin' so low ♪
4,40,Isabella,"Everybody loves Solo! Twelve parsecs! If I ever hear his name again, I'll just—"
4,40,Vanessa,"♪ So low, so low, so low, so low... ♪"
4,40,Isabella,"Would you two excuse me? (Isabella fires her blaster and we hear Vanessa groan.) Yeah, we should probably get going."
4,40,Vanessa,Well!
4,40,Isabella,"Here's my ship, the Centennial Chihuahua."
4,40,Phineas,Why'd you call it the Chihuahua?
4,40,Isabella,It's personal.
4,40,Phineas,Seems weird you'd call it something you didn't wanna be asked about.
4,40,Isabella,You're right. It was a call for attention.
4,40,Candace,There they are! (She blasts at them and hits a light.)
4,40,Phineas,"Whoa! Well, looks like we got it!"
4,40,Isabella,(pulls the two brothers onto the ship) Move it! We gotta get outta here!
4,40,Candace,Fire the cannon!
4,40,Baljeet,I think the barrel end slides in here.
4,40,Buford,But then the scope is on the bottom! That's not right!
4,40,Isabella,"Hold on, this is gonna be rough!"
4,40,Candace,Give me that! (She flips the cannon around and aims.) You're goin' down! (She fires but the cannon explodes.)
4,40,Phineas,Uh-oh!
4,40,Isabella,I see it!
4,40,Buford,(to Baljeet) And you thought we were gonna die in space.
4,40,Candace,Move move move!
4,40,Phineas,"Gosh, Ferb. Our planet looks so small from here."
4,40,Isabella,First time in space?
4,40,Phineas,"Well, yeah, now that you mentioned it."
4,40,Isabella,"(rubs off the ""planet"" to reveal it's just dirt) Yeah, your planet's over here."
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, that makes much more sense. Mom and Dad always did want us to see the galaxy, but I don't think that this is what they had in mind."
4,40,Isabella,You might want to buckle up. I'm makin' the jump to hyperspace!
4,40,Phineas,A little more warning would be nice.
4,40,C.O.,"Ahem. I grow tired of asking this but, please, tell me you have the socks."
4,40,Candace,"Yes! Buford? (Buford gives it to her.) With my compliments, sir."
4,40,C.O.,"Excellent, now report to the Death Star for re-assignment. I'll deliver these to Lord Vader myself."
4,40,Candace,Finally! Now we're gonna see some action!
4,40,C.O.,"Whoa whoa whoa! You're not riding in here! Uh, this shuttle's full. You can ride back to the Death Star on that bus pod."
4,40,Buford,What a piece of junk!
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Wait, that's it! I solved my Force problem! I can extract it from Vader's garbage. It...It says right here, see? You can find anything on the Internet. Hey, check it out, Norm-3PO. According to this real estate website, my time share on Alderaan is worth, like, 10 times more than I paid for it six years ago! Oh, I knew the value would go up! It's just, it's such a peaceful place to.. (Alderaan gets destroyed by the Death Star in the background.) Wait, what? What's this? The value is totally dropping!! Zero?!?!"
4,40,Isabella,"(angrily) Hey, whatcha doin'?!"
4,40,Phineas,"Isabella, did you know that you have T-27 thermal couplings up here?"
4,40,Isabella,Get down from there!
4,40,Phineas,Ferb and I can reroute their current to double up your power supply.
4,40,Isabella,"Just keep your paws off my ship! (beat, takes out a notepad) Reroute thermal couplings."
4,40,Phineas,"I wonder what our family and friends are doing back on Tatooine. It feels a little strange to be so far from them. But at least we're making new friends. Like you, Isabella."
4,40,Isabella,"This is not a friendship, it's a spaceship! So don't invade mine! (something beeps) We're coming out of hyperspace! Buckle up, ladies!"
4,40,Phineas,"Whadaya think, Ferb? A girl like her and a guy like me?"
4,40,Ferb,Sure. Why not?
4,40,Isabella,"As promised, the Millennium Falcon. I should be able to catch him before he gets to that small moon."
4,40,Phineas,"That's no moon. It's the Death Star! Isabella, turn the ship around!"
4,40,Isabella,What have you guys gotten me into?! We're caught in a tractor beam! My engines can't pull us free! (puts on goggles) Looks like we're gonna have to shoot our way out! I'm powering up the turrets!
4,40,Phineas,There are alternatives to fighting.

4,40,Jim Cummings,Oh Man...
4,40,Dan Povenmire,What is up with that guy?
4,40,Isabella,I should've known getting this close to Solo was a bad idea! Hurry it up back there!
4,40,Phineas,We've modified the deflector shield with a cloaking mechanism. Give it a try.
4,40,Isabella,"Well, this had better work or you two are floating home!"
4,40,Phineas,"I don't think we can float all the way home. I mean, we wouldn't survive 15 seconds in the cold vacuum of spa—"
4,40,Isabella,It's a figure of speech!
4,40,Phineas,"(offscreen) It worked! It even smells like donuts in here! Nice touch, Ferb."
4,40,Isabella,"Okay, let's see if it fools them. (speaks in a ""New Jersey"" accent) Uh, Dockin' Bay control, ya got us cott in a track-ta beam heeyuh! Ya guys want donuts or not?"
4,40,Imperial Officer Jeff,"Oh, shoot! Disengaging tractor beam. (he shuts it off) Deliveries are in Docking Bay 427. You're clear to land. (to Dan) So, donuts?"
4,40,Imperial Officer Dan,Does Darth Vader wear a funny hat?
4,40,Imperial Officer Jeff,Dude!
4,40,Imperial Officer Dan,"Oh, relax, he can't hear us all the way down— (Gets Force Choked)"
4,40,Imperial Officer Jeff,"Oh, no! I didn't!"
4,40,Imperial Officer Dan,Ha ha! Gotcha!
4,40,Imperial Officer Jeff,(grunts)
4,40,Candace,Can you believe this? Making us ride the bus pod? (Buford is looking in the bag when he realizes something.) They better give us a Rebel-fighting job this time and not just running some more errands.
4,40,Baljeet,Uh-oh!
4,40,Candace,"I mean, how hard is it to deliver socks?"
4,40,Baljeet,"Uh, Candace?"
4,40,Candace,Yes?
4,40,Baljeet,I believe Buford requires your attention.
4,40,Candace,"Oh, what is it, Buford? (Buford takes out some black socks from the bag to answer Candace's question.) Huh. Uh, Buford, I'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to think very hard before you answer."
4,40,Buford,Thinking is always hard.
4,40,Candace,"I know. Here's the thing. If we have Darth Vader's socks, what exactly did we give the commander?"
4,40,Buford,Uhhhhh....
4,40,Vader,I find your lack of socks disturbing.
4,40,Stormtrooper 6,Hello? Are you open yet?
4,40,Stormtrooper 7,Hope they have the old-fashioned. Those are my favorites.
4,40,Isabella,I can't believe that worked!
4,40,Phineas,"I feel guilty, though. Maybe we should get them some donuts."
4,40,Isabella,WOULD YOU STAY FOCUSED?!
4,40,Phineas,Huh. Sorry.
4,40,Isabella,"Okay, let's find Solo's ship and the droid, and then I'm outta here!"
4,40,Phineas,"Well, they've landed in Docking Bay 327, and we're in Docking Bay 427. (looks at the map) That's not so bad. (Sees Ferb with his eyes closed and his hand out) What is it, Ferb? What's with the hand?"
4,40,Ferb,I feel something. A presence I have not felt since...
4,40,Phineas,"Perry! (Perry runs into his arms for a hug) Hey, old buddy!"
4,40,Isabella,Who is this?
4,40,Phineas,"This is Perry the Platypus. He used to be our pet until we found out he was secretly an agent for the Rebellion. We felt a little betrayed and hurt at first, but bygones be bygones. Now we're good, right?"
4,40,Perry,(Chatters and thumbs up)
4,40,Phineas,"So you're probably on a mission right now, huh? (Perry thumbs up) Hey, so are we! (fist bumps Perry) Heh. Oh, uh, this is our pilot, Isabella."
4,40,Isabella,(points and clicks tongue in a bored manner)
4,40,Phineas,"So, uh, good luck. (shakes Perry's hand)"
4,40,Phineas,He looks good.
4,40,Isabella,Ugh! Let's get this over with!
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"There ought to be enough residual Force in Vader's garbage here to power it up for, y'know at least one shot."
4,40,Norm-3PO,One man's trash is another man's bad idea.
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Just put the garbage in the chute, Mr. Wisendroider! (door beeps) Well, well, well, it's Perry the Rebelpus! (The door does not open all the way. Perry shrugs.) Oh, sorry about the door. I...I put in a work order, but the guy's not gonna get down here 'til, like, Thursday. So, y'know. Ah, ah, look, Norm, you see? You put a big red ""X"" on the floor, people will stand there! (A trap door opens under Perry and he drops down and gets frozen in carbonite.) Human nature! Or, in this case, platypus nature."
4,40,Phineas,"What's wrong, Ferb? (Once again, Ferb has his eyes closed and hand out.) You got your hand up again."
4,40,Ferb,(Opens his eyes and puts his hand down) Perry is in trouble.
4,40,Phineas,Oh no! We must go help him.
4,40,Ferb,No. You must go get that disc to the Rebels. We cannot risk our mission.
4,40,Phineas,Split up? Really?
4,40,Isabella,Just do what you need to do fast and meet us at the Falcon!
4,40,Phineas,May the Force be with you and all that stuff.
4,40,Phineas,Come on! We gotta find that droid!
4,40,Norm-3PO,(hanging up the trapped platypus) There. It's just like art!
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Yeah, nothin' like a frozen platypus to tie a room together! Now, allow me to tell you why I created my latest inator."

4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Alright, stay close to your comlinks, ladies, and, if all goes well, I'll have a victory number in the fourth act. (to Perry) So, like I said, I'm going to make myself super-evil with my Sith-inator here, but first, I'm gonna shoot you just to make sure it's safe and, uh, y'know, I don't...die or fry myself and have to wear one of those masks like Vader, 'cuz that would not be a good look for me."
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"(offscreen) Eh, y'know, plus, if it works, you can join me on the Dark Side. We can be Sith buddies! Whadaya think? Huh? (activates the inator)"
4,40,Ferb,(yells in pain)
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait...what...who let a kid in here?! Hey, buddy, you okay? (to Perry) Yeah, he's gonna have a headache, but with any luck, he's gonna be so evil when he gets on his feet. Oh, great, I-I-I used up all the Force on this guy. Hey, Norm, grab the trash can. We gotta go refuel. Wait right here, Perry the Rebelpus. We'll be right back to turn you to the Dark Side, too, and then you, me, and...this kid in the cloak, I guess, can be the Three Sith-keteers!"
4,40,Norm-3PO,"Who can I be, sir?"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"You can be the horse. C'mon, let's go. We gotta get some more of that super-Force-y-Vader trash. I know just where to look."

Now we're talkin'! And what's this? This looks like a perfectly good bantha-cheese hoagie. Well, it's not good anymore. It's been underwater. Wow! According to this, it's reeking with Dark Force! Vader must've touched it. Put it in here. What else have you got for me? (The dianoga takes Luke.) That's not trash, dummy, that's a guy! Just put him back, I've got enough. Man, you can lead a dianoga to garbage but you can't make him think."
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,Uh-uh-uh! Don't forget to flush!

4,40,Norm-3PO,Where did we leave him? Behind this box? (Perry emerges from behind the box with a blaster. He blasts Norm-3PO and he screams like R2-D2.)
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Norm, what the heck are you standing around for? I thought I told you... Whoa whoa whoa whoa!! (Norm-3PO falls down on Darthenshmirtz. He groans.) Oh, my spleen."
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hey, get away from that! Perry the Rebelpus, you stay away from my inator! Don't make me— (Perry pulls down on Darthenshmirtz's jaw and throws him out.) No wait! Wait wait! Whooo!!! (Perry pounces on him.)"

4,40,Isabella,Quick! Back to my ship!
4,40,Phineas,"Wait, what about Ferb? We can't leave without him."
4,40,Isabella,"If we don't leave now, we'll lose the Falcon."
4,40,Phineas,But I can't leave my brother.
4,40,Isabella,"(indignantly) Tick-tock, tick-tock!"
4,40,Phineas,"Isabella, you've gotta take the disc back to R2. I'll go find Ferb."
4,40,Isabella,"If I leave, I am not coming back!"
4,40,Phineas,Fine. Just make sure you deliver the disc to the R2 unit.
4,40,Isabella,How do you know I won't just go back to Tatooine?
4,40,Phineas,(running off) I trust you!
4,40,Isabella,"Remember that ""brave or stupid"" thing? I know which one it is!"
4,40,Phineas,What is that? It looks like it was built by... (A cloaked figure drops down. Phineas knows who it could be.) Ferb?
4,40,Phineas,Cool face paint!
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,Oh no!
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,What?
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,The disc is gone! The one with the thing for blowing up the Death Star!
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,Are you kidding me?
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,It's supposed to be right here!
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,This is not happening! No no no! We are so dead!
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,"Is it right there? Is it on the floor? Maybe it fell out of the flight deck. Okay. Okay, I know. We'll blame Jar Jar."
4,40,R2-D2,(beeps)
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,"Jar Jar Bi— That's a terrible idea! He retired, like, 20 years ago!"
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,"Hey, it's not like we have a lot of options here."
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,"Okay, let's do this. You go get a thermal detonator, and we'll put it right back here on the..."
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,NO! How is that better than my Jar Jar idea?
4,40,Isabella,"Yo, tech support. Got something for ya."
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,(takes the disc) Oh my gosh! Thank you!
4,40,Rebel Officer 1,"Yes, thank you! You saved our lives! (chuckles) Whoa, that was a close one, huh? Hey, where do you think she found it?"
4,40,Rebel Officer 2,"Hey, man, never look a gift tauntaun in the oral cavity."
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hey, wait wait wait, I can't see! (Perry fights Darthenshmirtz.) Alright, someone's getting a lightsabering now! Oh, it's, uh, just a flashlight. I guess my lightsaber's in the camping supplies. (holds flashlight under his chin) Ooh, ooh, look, I'm scary—Uch, whatever. Bye! (he flees)"
4,40,Phineas,So is there like a face painting booth around here or something? And where's Perry? Were you able to find him?
4,40,Darth Ferb,"I found this: the Sith-inator. And I've modified it to create an army of Sith warriors. Join me on the Dark Side, brother."
4,40,Phineas,"(laughs) Shut up, Ferb! C'mon, let's get outta here. Isabella already left. We gotta find the ship so we can get home."
4,40,Darth Ferb,The Dark Side is my home now. (gets out a lightsaber)
4,40,Phineas,"Whoa, Ferb, what are you doing? (Phineas tries everything to avoid his now evil brother.) Come on, quit messin' around! Hey, this-this isn't funny. I'm not gonna fight you."
4,40,Darth Ferb,"If you will not join me, then I must destroy you."
4,40,Phineas,"Okay, I can see you're serious. (Darth Ferb swings his lightsaber and Phineas dodges it.) Ferb, this isn't you! We're brothers!"
4,40,Phineas,"Hey, this is crazy! We-We-We would never try to hurt each other! (Darth Ferb reveals he has a double-edged lightsaber. They continue to fight.) Is that the best you got? (Darth Ferb reveals he has more lightsabers now.) Oh, we're allowing modifications, huh? Gimme a sec. (He tinkers with his lightsaber.)"
4,40,Buford,"Hey, Candace, what's up?"
4,40,Candace,"Um, I was just thinking, we're the good guys, right?"
4,40,Baljeet,"Yes, I believe so."
4,40,Buford,That's what they told us durin' the brainwashin'.
4,40,Baljeet,"Orientation, Buford!"
4,40,Buford,"Potato, tomato."
4,40,Candace,And Rebels are bad. We know that.
4,40,Baljeet,Of course. The Rebels are always the bad guys.
4,40,Buford,What about Robin Hood?
4,40,Baljeet,That has not happened yet!
4,40,Candace,"Well, one of the Rebels just saved my life. He could've escaped, but, instead, he came back to help me."
4,40,Buford and Baljeet,Hmmmm...
4,40,Candace,And didn't we just blow up a planet?
4,40,Baljeet,"Hmm, yes, that is sort of difficult to justify...morally."
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"(maniacal laughter) You're over there and I'm over here and never the twain shall meet. So I guess you're just gonna have to give up. (Perry takes a grappling hook out of his uniform.) Oh, I-I see, you're gonna swing across like a monkey-man. (pounds on his chest) Hoo-hoo-hoo! Me swingy-swingy monkey-man! Go ahead, knock yourself out. There's no way you got enough cable to reach that. (The grappling hook latches onto Darthenshmirtz's uniform.) Oh, I see what you were trying to— Yaaah! (Both Perry and Darthenshmirtz fall and get caught on another platform.) Ow! No no no! (They crash through a wall.)"
4,40,Isabella,"Well, well, well, Han Solo."
4,40,PA Announcer,"All flight crews, man your stations."
4,40,Gretchen,"Hey, look! It's Isabella! Isabella, you've joined the Rebellion?"
4,40,Isabella,Not by a long shot.
4,40,Gretchen,"Well, you should. You're a great pilot. We need you, the odds are stacked against us. The Empire has everything, a Death Star, highly-trained troops, Darth Vader. And we're just a ragtag bunch of undertrained good-intentioned Rebels. And to be perfectly honest, Isabella, we're kids. We are actual children, and they're letting us fly fighters. That's how hopeless the situation actually is. So, you wanna help us?"
4,40,Isabella,"Strangely, still no. (She leaves them.)"
4,40,Porkins,(offscreen) Worst rallying speech ever!
4,40,Gretchen,"Shut up, Porkins!"
4,40,(Song,"""Let's Take A Rocketship To Space"" (jazz piano version))"
4,40,Isabella,"I'll have one of those. (she gets a juice box and some peanuts. Han and Chewie sit next to her.) What happened, Solo? Garbage scow tip over and dumped you here?"
4,40,Han,"What are you doing here, Isabella? Did someone run out of cupcakes?"
4,40,Isabella,Very funny. So where are you heading?
4,40,Han,As far away from here as possible. (eats some peanuts)
4,40,Isabella,Yeah. I don't have any reason to stay here either.
4,40,Han,I don't owe anything to anybody. (eats some more nuts. Chewie looks at him.)
4,40,Isabella,I'm not in this to make friends.
4,40,Han,Yeah. Obviously.
4,40,Isabella,What do you mean by that? I've got friends! I've got plenty of friends!
4,40,Han,Yeah? Where are they now?
4,40,Isabella,Well...where are yours?
4,40,Chewbacca,(growls)
4,40,Han,"Put a sock in it, fuzzball!"
4,40,Chewbacca,(whimpers and growls)
4,40,Han,"(sighs) Maybe you're right. Maybe I do have someplace to be. See you around, Isabella."
4,40,Isabella,"(sighs) Eh, the Wookiee is right. (she leaves)"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,Ow.
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Ah, it's good to be back. (Perry drops in) Hey! You're too late! No stopping me now! (He drops down into the trap door and gets frozen in carbonite.) Hey, it's cold in here! Ow! I've got such an ice cream headache!"
4,40,Darth Ferb,Now you will join me! (a blast shoots him and he groans)
4,40,Candace,Step away from the Rebel!
4,40,Phineas,Don't shoot him! He's my brother!
4,40,Candace,Your brother's a Sith warrior?!
4,40,Phineas,"No. I mean, yes. I mean...it's a recent development. Wait, why are you helping me? I'm a Rebel!"
4,40,Candace,I had to. I couldn't just leave you hanging.
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hey, heads up!"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hey, watch it!"
4,40,Candace,"Hold it right there, pal! Aaah! (Darth Ferb attacks her more.)"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Hey, you're gonna stretch out the elastic."
4,40,Phineas,Ferb! Please stop!
4,40,Candace,Now I really wish I'd bought the three-pack!
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Oh, man. I really should have ray-shielded that."
4,40,Phineas,(groans) Ferb? (Candace and Perry help him look under the rubble.)
4,40,Ferb,(groans)
4,40,Phineas,Are you okay?
4,40,Phineas,(hugs Ferb) Ferb!
4,40,Buford,"Found this perfectly good robe lying around. Has one hole, right here. Hey, look what else I just found! My hoagie!"
4,40,Baljeet,I would not eat that if I were you.
4,40,Candace,C'mon! Let's get off this battle station.
4,40,Phineas,But we don't have a ship!
4,40,Candace,I know where there's a bus pod.
4,40,Phineas,"Perry, great work! Hey, don't be a stranger!"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,You think maybe you could turn this thing over? All the blood's rushing to my head.
4,40,Phineas,"Hey, it's Luke! They must've got the plans! He should hit that exhaust port no problem. I mean it's as practically as big as a womp rat! (beat) Yeah, we should probably get outta here."
4,40,Candace,Come on! The bus pod is right through here!
4,40,Candace,Wait wait wait!
4,40,Buford,No no!
4,40,Baljeet,Oh no! That was the last ship!
4,40,Buford,"Yeah, we're toast."
4,40,Phineas,"Well, if we had to go out, at least it was for something we believe in."
4,40,Baljeet,My only regret is that I spent so much time on the wrong side.
4,40,Buford,My only regret is that I ate that hoagie.
4,40,Phineas,"I guess if I have a regret, it's that I never got reunited with my sister. She left Tatooine when I was just a baby."
4,40,Candace,Phineas?
4,40,Phineas,Candace?
4,40,Candace,"(hugs her brother) Oh, I can't believe it! You got so big!"
4,40,Phineas,Candace!
4,40,Candace,"I didn't even recognize you! Hey, wait a minute, why is this guy hugging us?"
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, this is Ferb. He's our stepbrother."
4,40,Candace,Mom remarried? What happened to Dad?
4,40,Phineas,(laughs) Funny story actually. He—
4,40,Phineas,"Wow, that was close! Thanks for coming back to get us, Isabella."
4,40,Isabella,"Well, that's what friends are for."
4,40,Baljeet,"Oh, but what about all those innocent baristas and bank tellers and bowling alley attendants?"
4,40,Isabella,They're fine. The Firestar Girls got them out earlier.
4,40,Everyone onboard,We're okay!
4,40,Major Hologram,"Ah, Agent P, with you stopping Darthenshmirtz, and the Rebellion destroying the Death Star, this day will be long remembered. Apparently, there are still copies of the Death Star plans out there so, we still might have a teeny problem there, but, heh, we'll blow up that battle station when we come to it. Hologram out!"
4,40,Darthenshmirtz,"Ha ha! So long, Perry the Platypus! Now I can live to fight in the sequel! (He goes into an escape pod laughing.) Eh. I probably should have thought this one through better. I didn't realize the escape pod would be Platypus-sized. Plus, I'm sitting on my keys."
4,40,Chewbacca,(growls)
4,40,Phineas,The Wookiee is right! Let's party!
4,40,(Song,"""Rebel, Let's Go!"")"
4,40,Vanessa,"All right, boys, let me hear some of that Rebel bass!"
4,40,Chewbacca,(growls)
4,40,Isabella,"Hey, farm boy. We're not related, are we?"
4,40,Phineas,"Oh, no, no, no. Not a chance. I only have just the one sister."
4,40,Isabella,(pulls him in) Good. (she kisses him and Phineas faints in a daze) Mmmmmwah!
4,40,Vanessa,♪ Tell ev'ryone we're back in full force ♪
4,40,Porkins,"(parachuting in) Hey, look, everyone, I'm okay! (crash!)"
4,40,Gretchen,"Way to ruin the moment, Porkins!"
4,48,Harry the Hyena,Oh? Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee! (grunts) Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh!!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no! The mission!"
4,48,(Song,O.W.C.A. Files)
4,48,Major Monogram,These are the stories of the agents of the O.W.C.A. These are the OWCA Files!
4,48,Harry the Hyena,Huh? Ha ha ha ha ha!
4,48,Leader,Huh?
4,48,Enemies,Yaaaaahhh!!
4,48,Perry,(whistles)
4,48,Carl,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Agent P, stop right there! Shut it down! Stop the exercise!"
4,48,Carl,"Agent P, nowhere in the O.W.C.A. training manual does it say, ""Abandon your team and apprehend the suspect by yourself."" You're not a lone wolf anymore. Your team lacks focus and they need your leadership."
4,48,Harry,Ha ha ha!
4,48,Maggie,"Learn to drive, you jerk!"
4,48,Carl,"Heck, one of your trainees didn't even show up."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no! I'm here! I'm here! (arrives with some rockets) Just a little late! I'm here! Phew! But it's okay, I made this to help."
4,48,Carl,You can't shoot that at a suspect! Are you crazy?! It would blow them to smithereens!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,What's the big deal? I blow up all the time.
4,48,Carl,"Nevertheless, individually, your scores look promising, but there's still a big problem with teamwork."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, bub, it's just a piece of clipart."
4,48,Harry,Hee hee hee hee hee...
4,48,Carl,"And, Doofenshmirtz, you're lucky you're legally considered an ocelot, or you wouldn't be here at all!"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah. I'd say that's probably the first time anyone has described my being abandoned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats as ""lucky""."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,You're gonna be wearing that thing in a second.
4,48,Harry,Heh...heh heh heh...
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Besides, I've, I've given up evil."
4,48,Carl,"Look, if you guys can't pass this training exercise, there's no way you'll complete ""Town Square Riot"", ""Freeway Assault"", or ""Escape the Ancient Ruin"". Agent P, your trainees need to learn how to work together as a team or they're never gonna earn their black hat bands. And, uh, Karen? (takes out a laser pointer and points it at Karen, who is chasing a butterfly) Karen the Cat. Pay attention. Karen, I'm over here."
4,48,Karen,Meow.
4,48,Carl,"Follow the light. That's right. Now, you're going to have to do the entire training exercise again."
4,48,OWCA Day-Players,Yay! High five!
4,48,Carl,"No, I'm not approving overtime. We'll do it without you day-players."
4,48,OWCA Day-Players,Awwww...
4,48,OWCA Day-Player,Come on. Let's just storm out as if we have somewhere else to go.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Carl, when you're finished with Agent P's team on the backlot, return to headquarters immediately."
4,48,Carl,"Sorry, Agent P. Gotta go. (gives Perry the laser pointer and the manual) Carry on. And remember! Teamwork!"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, can we still use this thing? (He activates the rocket and it blasts into an unknown area.) Heh heh heh. Well, y'know, hopefully that didn't hit anything important."
4,48,Napoleon,The dust clears and here we are.
4,48,Napoleon (cont'd),OWCA Secret Headquarters.
4,48,Wendell,Doesn't look very secret to me.
4,48,Napoleon,"Be that as it may, today is the day that we will become OWCA's first insect agents."
4,48,Wendell,But they never responded to our applications.
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, and I can't understand why. We mailed them in on time, right before the year-end deadline."
4,48,Major Monogram and Agents,"Three, two, one!"
4,48,Carl,Happy New Year!
4,48,Napoleon,"It's possible that our applications have fallen through the cracks. Which is why we are following up with a personal visit. That's how you get noticed, and that's how we will become agents. Imagine fighting international supervillains, traveling to exotic locales."
4,48,Wendell,"And I'm gonna get all kinds of cool spy stuff, like a jet pack, a tuxedo and scuba fins!"
4,48,Wendell,"Yeah! That oughta do it! (He turns on his jet pack setting his house on fire and bumping into the ceiling.) Napoleon, I can see your house from here!"
4,48,Wendell,"How 'bout you, Floyd? What do you want? Uh, a fountain pen that shoots lasers? (gasps) Or a car that shoots fountain pens?"
4,48,Floyd,I want a monkey.
4,48,Napoleon,"Mmm, yes. For whatever twisted reason, you shall acquire your primate."
4,48,Floyd,Monkey.
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, a monkey is a... You know what? Nevermind. My point is, now that we're here, all we have to do is get someone's attention. Ah, here comes a helpful looking lad now. Excuse me, sir— (Carl steps on the bugs) Obviously, we need to try a different approach."
4,48,Floyd,I still want a monkey.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Carl, this new facility is really impressive. Now, tell me again where you found the money for all these improvements."
4,48,Carl,I just solved a small ongoing accounting error. You kept putting decimal points where you needed to put commas.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Oh, I see! Improper punctuation. Say, how is Agent P's team shaping up?"
4,48,Carl,Well...
4,48,Major Monogram,"Great! Agent P is the best we have. If anyone can get that team in shape, it's him."
4,48,Carl,"Yes, sir, but I—"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Carl, isn't it time that we talked about the elephant in the room?"
4,48,Carl,"What do you mean, sir?"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Well, what exactly is he doing?"
4,48,Carl,Obviously something's itching him.
4,48,Major Monogram,"And Agent W, too."
4,48,Major Monogram (cont'd),It's really taking a toll on our brand new facility.
4,48,Carl,I don't understand all the itching. I handed out the new flea collars this morning.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Then something's not right because OWCA is infested with fleas. Carl, activate emergency flea protocol 993-alpha."
4,48,Carl,"(on a communication device) Agent C, activate emergency flea protocol 993-alpha."
4,48,Agent C,Bawk!
4,48,Agent I,(gasps)
4,48,Carl,"Okay, everyone. When the sensors stop detecting the presence of fleas, the doors will automatically open. Agents, prepare for flea fogging."
4,48,Napoleon,"This must be our first test, gentlemen. As agents, we must know how to elude things like deadly toxic clouds."
4,48,Wendell,"Just for the record, that was not me."
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, Wendell, I— Let's just get down in that drawer."
4,48,Napoleon,"Look at all this spy equipment! (looks at a pair of scissors) Some sort of giant cutting device, latex bands, miles of insect rope, giant fly— Aah! Whoa!"
4,48,Floyd,(behind a magnifying glass) What is happening to me?
4,48,Napoleon,"Look at this magnification apparatus that Floyd has found. This could be just the thing we need to get noticed. (sniffs, to Wendell) Okay, that was you."
4,48,Wendell,Guilty. Sorry.
4,48,Carl,"Fogging sequence complete. Flea problem solved, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,"First, the flea collars don't work and now fogging doesn't take? What kind of fleas are these?"
4,48,Agent D,Grrr!
4,48,Carl,"Agent D, would you mind? (lifts Agent D's flea collar and gets a flea with some tweezers) Hmm. Gotcha! Let me see something."
4,48,Wendell and Napoleon,(grunting)
4,48,Napoleon,Okay. Gently lower it into place. All we have to do is get up there—
4,48,Napoleon,"Aw, nuts."
4,48,Napoleon,"There. You see? It's a good thing we let go, otherwise, we would've ended up just like that peanut."
4,48,Bug Trio,Whoa!!
4,48,Carl,"Oh, my gosh! It's a tiny robot!"
4,48,Major Monogram,What kind of a freak would make robot fleas?
4,48,Villain,Hello.. (laughs) Francis Monogram! (laughs)
4,48,Major Monogram,Great googly moogly! Who are you?
4,48,Villain,"I am Professor Parenthesis. Although, I'm not really here. This is a holographic image."
4,48,Carl,"Major, I'm looking up Professor Parenthesis in our database. There's not much on him."
4,48,Parenthesis,It's Parenthesis! Not Parenthesis!
4,48,Carl,Are you sure? Because it's spelled—
4,48,Parenthesis,You would think I would know how my own name is pronounced.
4,48,Carl,"Yeah, you'd think."
4,48,Major Monogram,Why are you here?
4,48,Parenthesis,You don't remember me. We were in biology class together long ago. You barely noticed me.
4,48,Major Monogram,"You're not that guy who kept eating his own hair, are you?"
4,48,Parenthesis,No. That was Jeffrey Stovel.
4,48,Major Monogram,Were you the kid who got his chin stuck in that graduated cylinder?
4,48,Parenthesis,"No, that was Jennifer Stillwell! And she was a girl! All you need to know is that I'm the one who sent those flea collars!"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Oh, are you that kid who wore that Robin Hood hat and passed out in the drinking fountain?"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Billy Youjeka! And can we move on, please?"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Yeah, sorry. So, why did you send those flea collars?"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Well, it's taken me 30 years to come up with a plan this diabolical. Five of those years were spent in villains academies. Then, after school, I started working on that screenplay I always wanted to write. But revenge was always on my mind, Francis Monogram!"
4,48,Major Monogram,Stop saying my name like that!
4,48,Carl,Didja ever finish that screenplay?
4,48,Parenthesis,This is my screenplay! (hands Carl his screenplay) Right here. I'd like to get your notes.
4,48,Carl,"Oh, I'd be happy to. (tries to pick it up, then remembers it's a hologram. To Monogram) Seriously?! You don't remember this jerk?!"
4,48,Major Monogram,Were you the kid who...
4,48,Parenthesis,The robot fleas were actually inside the flea collars that you put on all of your agents. Now this remote will give me complete control over all of them!
4,48,Parenthesis,"(maniacal laugh) And now, Francis Monogram, say goodbye to your precious OWCA! (maniacal laughter, then disappears, but reappears, to Carl) Seriously, though. I'll email you the screenplay. Tell me what you think. (disappears again)"
4,48,Carl,"Sir, he's turned all of our animal agents against us!"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Carl, are you familiar with the term ""a-duh""?"
4,48,Carl,"(offscreen) What are we gonna do, sir?!"
4,48,Major Monogram,Do we have any agents on the outside? Anyone without a collar?
4,48,Major Monogram,"Agent P. Come in, Agent P. Oh, good, you're all right. We need your help. OWCA's on lockdown. We're trapped!"
4,48,Major Monogram,And all of the agents are being controlled by a sinister being named Professor Parenthesis.
4,48,Carl,"That's Parenthesis, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,"Oh, right. Anyway, Parenthesis is using robot fleas to control our agents' minds..."
4,48,Carl,Left turn!
4,48,Major Monogram,Whoa! He snuck the fleas into OWCA Headquarters by hiding them in a shipment of flea collars.
4,48,Carl,Right turn!
4,48,Major Monogram,"And now he's...Hey, Carl! Whoa! Anyway, he's controlling them with a small remote device. It's up to you and your team to find Parenthesis and destroy that remote. You're all we've got on the outside, so..."
4,48,Carl,Wet floor!
4,48,Major Monogram,Whoa! Great googly moogly!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, that sounds kind of serious. Guess the first thing we should do is start looking for clues? Huh? Huh?"
4,48,Maggie,(repeating what Monogram said) Shipment of flea collars!
4,48,"(Cut to Karen in a box labeled ""Contents","Flea Collars"".)"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"It's the box those flea collars came in. And there's his return address. ""The Bottom of the Grand Canyon."" Hey, hold on a second. Parenthesis! I know that guy! I met him at an evil convention about three years ago. Walks around in those pink slippers pushing his screenplay on everyone. Sure. (closeup on Doof) And now we got his home address! (Long shot to reveal Doof alone.) Perry the Platypus, we should go to your secret lair and get your hover car... (the rest are already ahead) Okay, fine, just... Just remember it was my idea!"
4,48,Napoleon,"Well, that did not go as planned."
4,48,Wendell,"(offscreen) Hey, Napoleon, there's peanut butter over here!"
4,48,Napoleon,"Floyd, your head is upside-down."
4,48,Wendell,"There's peanut butter over here, too! (gasps) There's peanut butter all over!"
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, well, there's always a silver lining, isn't there? I think the problem is we need to be up on their eye level."
4,48,Wendell,Like those guys up there?
4,48,Napoleon,Uh...yes?? And no.
4,48,Butterfly,Tell my wife I love her.
4,48,Napoleon,"While th-their position is not advantageous, they are illuminated by a light, which gives me an idea."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"(panting) Man, you guys are... You guys are fast. Ah, so this must be your...your host family's house. What's with all the rockets in the r— Oh, those are mine! That must be where they landed! Wh-What a coincidence! Well, it's a good thing they're not armed or... (The rockets start beeping. Doof chuckles.) Don't worry, Perry the Platypus. Everything is gonna be okay."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"If I can get a ladder, I can defuse them before they blow up. (Notices the house is destroyed.) Eh. Well, on the bright side, now we don't have to find that ladder."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, what a mess. But don't worry, Perry the Platypus. OWCA's got plenty of money now. They'll... (snaps fingers) They'll fix this place up before your host family even gets back and they'll, they'll replace all this junk with...y'know, pretty much identical junk. (Harry gives him a look.) What?"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!
4,48,Karen,REOW!!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, see? A cat always lands on my feet."
4,48,Karen,Meow.
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, Perry the Platypus, is this your lair? Nice! At least it, it would be if it wasn't so, y'know, blown to smithereens. (He picks up and throws away a Perry the Inaction Figure.) Oh, hey, an underwater diving capsule. (He knocks it over.) Man, I see why you never use it. ♪ Fragile! ♪ And is that a pressurized space suit? 'Cause that is not what you wore when we were in space. Hey, check this out! (Picks up the locket from Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension.) Oh, you look so young! Who's a widdle pwatypus?! (He hears Perry starting his hovercar.) Where do you think you're going? (He throws the locket in the toilet.) No-no-no-no-no-no, look. I know you might be a little upset, what with your house and your lair so exploded and all, and... And I have to admit that I feel...slightly responsible..."
4,48,Maggie,(imitating the rockets) Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep... PYEOW!!!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, thanks for the recap, Maggie. Anyway, you can't just go off and solve this without me."
4,48,Harry,(snorts)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"I was getting to you guys. I mean, without me and them. And the cat, wherever the..."
4,48,Karen,(purrs)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm. Anyway, I know we can't all fit in this, but...if we work together, there's a lot of blown up stuff lying around here, and I'm, I'm sure we can jury rig something that will carry, y'know, all of us. Like a well-bonded machine."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, the welds aren't really bonded on this machine, so, y'know, try not to move around too much in flight. Grand Canyon, here we come!"
4,48,Narrator,5 hours later...
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah. If anyone happens to see a canyon that looks sorta grandish, just speak up. Or maybe not speak up, maybe meow up, or squawk, er, whatever it is that you do, up."
4,48,Maggie,Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet?
4,48,Harry,"Ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee hee hee hee! (sighs, groans)"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,Yeah.
4,48,Doofenshmirtz and Maggie,Are we there yet?
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) I have no way of knowing, because I've never been there, and...you don't talk."
4,48,Maggie,Are we there yet? (plucks a feather) Are we there yet? (plucks a feather)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Man, these guys are really annoying. Doncha think?"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm right, aren't I? Annoying. Yeah, I'm right."
4,48,Parenthesis,"♪ Beautiful lunchtime, at my secret lair, in the Grand Canyon. ♪ Ah, I'm starving."
4,48,Parenthesis,"Well, that was delightful. I couldn't eat another gram."
4,48,Parenthesis,"Well, well. It appears someone has flown into my airspace. Perhaps we should send a welcome party."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, the Grand Canyon. It's nice. You got the Colorado River, you got the giant robot fleas. you got these nice red rocks right h— (gasps) Wait a second! The Colorado River?! I thought we were in Arizona! (gasps) And wait another second! Giant robot fleas?!? Yeah, those are definitely the attack drones of an evil scientist. Yeah, y-you're gonna wanna punch it."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"All right! Nice one! Oh, let me help. We gotta have some weapons around. Wait wait wait, what does this lever do? (pulls the lever several times) No, no, no, that, uh, it doesn't...it doesn't seem to do anything. (Cut to reveal Perry's seat hitting him, revealing what it does.)"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Give me something to hit him with. (Takes the football helmet Karen is sitting in.) Thanks, Harry."
4,48,Karen,REEEEERR!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,Take that!
4,48,Maggie,We lost the cat! We lost the cat!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, relax. The cat's right... (realizes she's gone. Rotates his seat at the fleas.) Take that! And that! One for you, too! There you go! Uh-oh. Where's Harry? Oh, there he is! I see a bright future for that kid. Well, y'know, if we survive today. Oh, and there's Karen. Hi, Karen!"
4,48,Carl,(whispering) The access vent won't take us any further.
4,48,Major Monogram,"The hallway is crawling with compromised agents. We're gonna hafta do some creative sneaking, Carl. Follow my lead. (They sneak around.) The cobra. (They do a pose, while Agent C passes by, not noticing them. They start sneaking again.) Andalusian dog. (They pose again, while Agent F passes by.)"
4,48,Agent F,Ribbit. Ribbit. Ribbit.
4,48,Major Monogram,Violin and candlestick. (They pose as Gary the Gander flies past them. They jump over some lamps and a desk chair offscreen.) Garden party.
4,48,Carl,(offscreen) Garden party?
4,48,Major Monogram,(offscreen) Just give me your ankles.
4,48,Napoleon,There. That should be sufficient wattage to illuminate us.
4,48,Wendell,Why do we wanna be laminated?
4,48,Napoleon,Not laminated. Illuminated. It means to have light shown upon us.
4,48,Wendell,Like a grape?
4,48,Napoleon,Yes. Like... Like a grape?
4,48,Wendell,"Yeah, I saw a grape this morning."
4,48,Napoleon,And there was light shining on it?
4,48,Wendell,"You saw it, too?"
4,48,Napoleon,Moving on. Do we have enough power for all these lights?
4,48,Wendell,"Yup. We're all plugged into that plug collector thingy, and all we have to do is turn it on."
4,48,Napoleon,"Well, let's do that then."
4,48,Wendell,Yes! And then we can all be laminated!
4,48,Napoleon,"No, it's illu... You know what? Nevermind. Floyd, when we get up on the box, you throw that switch!"
4,48,Floyd,I like laminated grapes.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Come on, Carl. Let's get outta here! (he opens the door, but it is blocked) Carl, what the heck?!"
4,48,Carl,"Well, it never occurred to me that the emergency exit would be locked down, too."
4,48,Major Monogram,Isn't that something you should've checked before we crawled through all that duct work?
4,48,Carl,"I suppose... but, I was... just having so much fun sneaking around with you."
4,48,Major Monogram,"Actually, I was kinda havin' fun, too. Heh heh. Nevertheless, this isn't a situation to make light of."
4,48,Napoleon,"Okay, Floyd. Make some light!"
4,48,Floyd,(jumping off the garbage can onto the switch) Weeee.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Ooh! (chuckles) Uh, (points to his right) We went that way! (runs the other direction)"
4,48,Carl,Heh heh heh... uhhhh... additional misdirect! (follows Monogram)
4,48,Wendell,Down here!
4,48,Napoleon,
4,48,Wendell,"Floyd, focus the beam!"
4,48,Floyd,"Stop, drop, and roll, sir."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you know what they say. Any landing where you don't get stabbed with a fork is a good one. And I didn't get stabbed with a fork. Any of you guys? Hello? Harry?"
4,48,Harry,(whistles)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, there he is. Impressive! Y'know, as, as evil lairs go, I give that, like, an eight. It looks like a classic mid-'60s megalomaniacal design. And the water feature is very nice. Fortunately, I know a thing or two about... (pull out to reveal Doof alone again) Sheesh! (Doof goes over to the others, who are looking at a scale model of the lair.) Oh, heh. Yeah, w-way to get the ball rolling there, Perry the Platypus. I-I see you're gonna use the... (looks at the manual) Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique, or SEFIT. Man, these guys are really bad at acronyms. Good choice, though. Wh-What do I get to do? (stammers) What's my part? (Perry points behind Doof as he sees a coffee shop.) Oh, I'm the coffee guy. Good start. We're gonna need to stay sharp on this one."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I'm back. Eh, who had the double espresso? (Harry takes it.) There you go. And a caramel macchiato. (Maggie takes it.) Maggie. And I guess that means that Perry the Platypus had the... Yes, the oolong tea, of course. And I got a scone, but it was like, five dollars. So I only got one. Oh, you got little figurines. There's Harry, and Maggie, and eh, where's my little guy? (Perry picks up a rock and paints a crudely-drawn Doof onto it.) Ah, that's sorta nice, it's... (Perry places Doof by the model of the coffee shop to make a point.) Oh, wh-wh-while you guys do that, I'll just be back...over... Alright, well, I guess I'll just be over... over here if you need me."
4,48,(Song,They Left Me Standing Outside)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,I coulda helped. I understand the Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique. Step one: Diversion.
4,48,Parenthesis,"(to his robot fleas) Jason, Shirley, water is no longer coming out of my hole. Get down there and see what you can do about it."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) Step two: Immobilization.
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Step three: Infiltration. They'll take them completely by surprise. They'll just walk right in the door past that giant lava lamp, and... Why would there be a giant? (record scratch) IT'S A TRAP!!"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Ah, Perry the Platypus and friends. Right on time. Actually, you're a little early. (drops open the trap door) Ah, now you're on time!"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Well, well, well, now that you're all bottled up, I'm free to go to OWCA for the culmination of my evil plan! In 28 minutes, my fleas will have worked their way into each agent's neuro-pathways. And then my mind control will be permanent! I will single-handedly take control of every OWCA agent! (to some fleas) Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, to the Parentho-Copter! (to the trainees) I hope you find my accommodations uncomfortable. (lights a wrecking ball on fire and releases it) And yes. Soon it will be worse."
4,48,Karen,Meow!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, looks like you might need my help after all! Lucky for you I brought a rope, with a dreamcatcher on the end! That's what you call style! Anyway, alright, here, catch. (throws the dreamcatcher at Karen, but she pushes it off the edge) Uh, Karen, I don't think you're grasping this whole ""grab the rope"" concept. Can someone else get this one? (it gets tangled in the wrecking ball) Oh, great, now it's tangled in the... AAAAAHHHH!!! (The wrecking ball ends up in the capsule.) Wow! Did you guys see that? I almost got— Alright, minor setback. No problem. I'm just gonna have to come down there and get you myself. (Pushes a rubber raft through the door.) See, this is why I brought the raft."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I might have a little bit of a pro— (falls down and ends up in the water. He gets on the raft but is surrounded by alligators.) Get back, you, before I get all Creole chef on you! (to the trainees) Come on, you guys! Jump! I gotcha! I gotcha! I got— (the trainees jump into the raft)"
4,48,Karen,Reeeeeooww!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"See? A cat always lands on my feet. Wait, nobody move. Here. (takes a selfie) That's goin' on my blog."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, uh, that can't be good."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Woo! Woooo! I did it! I saved you guys and now we're safe! (some alligators land in their raft) Except for the fact that it's, you know, raining alligators. And secret lairs."
4,48,Major Monogram,"Good thing we found a hiding place, Carl. What is this? A dining room table or something?"
4,48,Carl,"It's a desk, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,A desk we can both hide under? Whose office is this anyway?
4,48,Carl,"It's mine, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,Yours?! This is at least ten times bigger than my office!
4,48,Carl,"Sir, that's not important now! We need to find a way to escape!"
4,48,Major Monogram,And how do you rate your own bathroom?
4,48,Carl,"It's actually a gym, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,Is that a chocolate fountain?
4,48,Carl,"Sir, listen. I got an idea. If we can get to the evacuation wing, we might be able to use one of the escape pods."
4,48,Major Monogram,What's up with the giant bear?
4,48,Carl,Oh. That was a gift from our contractor.
4,48,Major Monogram,That gives me an idea! But this conversation isn't over.
4,48,(Song,Friend Like Mine)
4,48,Carl,"I can't see back here, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,"You drew the short straw, Carl."
4,48,Napoleon,"Just a little higher. Ah, we've finally reached the summit. Come, gentlemen, it's time to get noticed!"
4,48,Wendell,"Oh, boy! Oh, sorry, Floyd, are you okay?"
4,48,Floyd,"Wendell, I've had an epiphany! In order for us to obtain our noble goal, we must evaluate the— (groaning) Ow."
4,48,Wendell,"Sorry, Floyd, did you say something?"
4,48,Floyd,I like trains.
4,48,Wendell,"Oh, my! By my larva-making mother, would you look at that! It's like the floor is frozen, but it's warm. It's like warm ice. Did we discover this? We should call it ""wice""."
4,48,Napoleon,"Actually, it's called glass."
4,48,Wendell,"No. I think it should be some combination of warm and ice. Floyd, come take a look at this!"
4,48,Floyd,I need a face shoe.
4,48,Wendell,"So, what's your plan, Napoleon?"
4,48,Napoleon,"Ah, it's quite simple, actually. We are standing atop a giant duplication device. A device that will not only copy our images, but will enlarge us as well. I simply need to program in the right size. Let's see. 200% enlargement. Okay, men, get on the glass platen, and get ready to be enlarged."
4,48,Wendell,"All set, Napoleon!"
4,48,Napoleon,And (jumps on the button) copy! Everyone smile for the camera. (The copier scans them) Excellent! Now we just have to wait for the toner to do its work.
4,48,Napoleon,"Well, yes, Wendell, that was fortun—"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Y'know, it, uh... It could've been worse. Uh, don't..don't all thank me at once. Knowing my talent has served my fellow agents is thanks enough."
4,48,Maggie,Rawk! Lousy rescue!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"I wouldn't call it lousy, per se. A little off, maybe, but... Oh, come on. Harry the Hyena, it was a good rescue, wasn't it?"
4,48,Harry,"A-hee-ha-ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha ha ha ha ha. Eh, heh heh... Eh... Nah."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Karen the Cat? Anything? Uh, no? What did you think of the rescue, Perry the— (Perry throws the training manual at Doof) Ow! (Perry takes off in his jet pack) Hey, Perry the Platypus, you're leaving us?!"
4,48,(Song,Bits of All of Us)
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"(shooing the letters away) Knock it off! Hope that's not permanent. Oh, I get it! H-Hey, hey, you guys, come back. Come back! Now, let me just explain."
4,48,Maggie,Macaw!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasps) That's right! ""Macaw"" has a ""W"" in it! So we can do it! Okay, here, from the beginning."
4,48,Carl,"There it is, sir! The escape pod!"
4,48,Major Monogram,Great! Let's get outta here!
4,48,Carl,"Okay, sir, but be careful. There's a huge set of stairs."
4,48,Major Monogram,"(sarcastically) Well, that went well."
4,48,Carl,"Sarcasm isn't helping, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,"Aw, there we go— Aw, ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
4,48,Carl,"Okay, this button launches the escape pod."
4,48,Major Monogram,"(offscreen) Uh, Carl, how does the escape hatch work with, you know, this whole lockdown thing?"
4,48,Carl,(offscreen) Uhhh...
4,48,Major Monogram,Owwwwwww.
4,48,Parenthesis,"Well, well, well, Francis Monogram! It's hostile takeover time!"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Carl, how was he able to override the lockdown?"
4,48,Carl,"Well, it opens from the outside, sir."
4,48,Major Monogram,Ehhh.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Okay, you made your point, Parenthesis. Apparently, I didn't notice you in school. Sad story. Boo-hoo. But why are you here?"
4,48,Parenthesis,I'm here to make your days the darkest of grays and your nights the blackest of black. I want to see your smug smile melt away like the candles on a sad little abandoned birthday cake.
4,48,Carl,Sounds like he's here to bore us to death.
4,48,Parenthesis,"As soon as my mecha-fleas completely override your agents' natural instincts, I will release them out into the unsuspecting world, where they will wreak havoc. And all you'll be able to do is sit and watch as the people of the world grow to deride and despise Francis Monogram and his monstrous OWCA as much as I do!!"
4,48,Carl,(to Monogram) How about now?
4,48,Major Monogram,"No, I still don't remember him!"
4,48,Wendell,"Wow, Napoleon, we're huge!"
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, this is bound to get us noticed."
4,48,Wendel,So how do we get them to see it?
4,48,Napoleon,"Well, it would be preferable if it were at their eye level."
4,48,Floyd,We could build a paper airplane.
4,48,Napoleon,"If we could find a staple remover, some dental floss... Wait, Floyd, what did you say?"
4,48,Floyd,I want a monkey?
4,48,Napoleon,"No, what did you just say?"
4,48,Floyd,I want a monkey.
4,48,Napoleon,What were the last words out of your mouth?
4,48,Wendell,"Well, actually, those were the last words out of his mouth. You asked him, ""What did you say?"" And he said, ""I want a monkey."" He said it twice, if you count this last time."
4,48,Napoleon,"Well, I...I... Okay, Floyd, immediately before you said ""I want a monkey"" twice..."
4,48,Floyd,I don't want two monkeys.
4,48,Wendel,Is this about the face shoe?
4,48,Napoleon,"Oh, forget it! We're making a paper airplane!"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Almost out of time! The suspense is delicious, don't you think? (laughs)"
4,48,Major Monogram,"Hey, Parenthesis, I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you. Heh heh."
4,48,Parenthesis,What?
4,48,Major Monogram,"Nice upholstery job, Agent P! We got this guy. You take down Parenthesis."
4,48,Parenthesis,"Agents, you know what to do."
4,48,Agent E,(trumpets)
4,48,Parenthesis,Excellent! Soon all this will be mine! First thing I'll do is put that sofa back there on the atrium where it belongs. Then I'll—
4,48,Carl,"Oh, my gosh!"
4,48,Carl,Does that mean what I think it means?
4,48,Major Monogram,No. It means Parenthesis was... a robot.
4,48,Carl,"Alright. Well, now I'm confused. What did you think I thought it meant?"
4,48,Napoleon,There. This seems aerodynamically sound.
4,48,Wendell,Now all we need is a big rubber band and two palm trees to launch us!
4,48,Napoleon,"You watch way too much TV, Wendell."
4,48,Wendell,"Oh, just the one show."
4,48,Napoleon,"But, perhaps some form of propulsion would be beneficial. (Looks at the fan.) Hmmm."
4,48,Floyd,"Uh, guys. (cut to reveal Floyd's head not attached to his body) I think I got a paper cut."
4,48,Napoleon,"Uh, Wendell."
4,48,Wendell,I'll go get the gauze.
4,48,Major Monogram,"Well, I guess that's that. We should get that remote device and... (looks inside the body) Whoa! (the robot body grabs Monogram, and pushes Carl, and Perry onto the sofa.) Oh, no, I can't. (The robot body lifts Monogram up in the air so he can see inside.) What?"
4,48,Parenthesis,(laughs maniacally) Aloha!
4,48,Major Monogram,Wait. You're a flea?
4,48,Parenthesis,Recognize me now?
4,48,Major Monogram,Why would I recognize a flea?
4,48,Parenthesis,"See? See? There's that attitude again! (A TV set with multiple mechanical arms pops out of the robot's body. The TV shows the flea's face.) You've always looked down your nose at me. Well, now, who's beneath who?"
4,48,Parenthesis,"He's getting away! He'll ruin everything! Hold these, guys. Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, you're with me!"
4,48,Wendell,"Napoleon, how are you steering this?"
4,48,Napoleon,"I'm not, Wendell. We are at the mercy of the wind! YEEHAW!!"
4,48,Parenthesis,Get him!
4,48,Parenthesis,Where did the platypus go? (gasps) Connie! There you go. Lemme just straighten your collar. To the freeway!
4,48,Parenthesis,"How about a little oncoming traffic, you portentous platypus?"
4,48,Parenthesis,Yes! Finish him!
4,48,Parenthesis,What's this?
4,48,Parenthesis,"Here, little semi--aquatic mammal. Here, boy. Nowhere to turn now! Oh, look, I'm wearing glasses. I'm a hipster."
4,48,Parenthesis,"Okay, end of the line, platypus! You've nowhere to... Oooh, cotton candy! Give me some of that!"
4,48,Parenthesis,"Does anyone see him? He's small, teal, wears a hat. Oh, come on. How hard is it to find a small platypus in a carnival setting? Don't say it! I just heard myself."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, yeah! Great throw, Harry!"
4,48,Harry,Ha ha ha ha ha!
4,48,Maggie,(squawks)
4,48,Parenthesis,Whoa!
4,48,Maggie,"Mmm, got it!"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,Woohoo!
4,48,Harry,Yeah!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Thanks for believing in your team, Perry the Platypus."
4,48,Parenthesis,"You think this cage can stop me?! (tears the gate off, grabs the agents and laughs) I have you now!"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great! Karen's here! We're saved!"
4,48,Maggie,We're dead!
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Gwan, Karen, do your thing."
4,48,Parenthesis,"Oh. I forgot the feline. Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, take the cat out."
4,48,Karen,Reeeeor!
4,48,Parenthesis,What?! No! You'll pay for that!
4,48,Parenthesis,Wah! (gasps) My slipper!  Ahh! NO!
4,48,Karen,(screeches)
4,48,Parenthesis,"Hey! Ow! Aw! Ow! (sighs) Oh, well, you guys do work well together. But to no avail. I may be boo-boo'd and bruised, but I still have control over OWCA's agents! Ha! And it all becomes permanent in just five more seconds! (something is heard falling from the sky. It is the fan falling on Parenthesis.) AAAAAAH!!"
4,48,Wendell,"Hey, Napoleon, our motor came off."
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,(gathering the flea with tweezers) And gotcha!
4,48,Major Monogram,"Well done, team! You've earned those black hat bands. You are now officially OWCA agents!"
4,48,Wendell,"Look, Napoleon. They got to be agents."
4,48,Napoleon,"Yes, and not us. (The plane begins to plummet.) Whoa! (sighs) We should take this as a sign. (takes up a violin) Bugs are not meant to be agents. (plays ""Nearer My God to Thee"") Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure serving with you. (The wind carries them off.) Whoa!"
4,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, hey, now that we're agents, when do I get to use this thing? (launches a rocket launcher) Whoa! (The rockets crash into the OWCA headquarters.) Oops, sorry."
4,48,Major Monogram,Carl?
4,48,Carl,"There's still money in the budget, sir."
4,48,Napoleon,I don't believe it! We've landed safely! I take this as a sign! We will be the best agents that OWCA has ev—

4,12,Katie,My favorite part is the B-flat with the F-sharp bass at the end of the song! (They all look at her.) What? It's tradition!
4,12,Isabella,"Okay, girls, festivities are over. Let's focus on getting our beekeeping patches. It's the only patch that we've ever tried to get and failed. Remember last year?"
4,12,Gretchen,(Interrupting Isabella's flashback) Eep! You promised to never flashback on that ever again.
4,12,Isabella,"Right, right! You're right. (Walks outside to a yard with a bee hive in the middle.) But still, if we don't succeed today, the two strikes and you're out rule kicks in, which means this spot will stay empty on our sashes forever! (Close up on her sash showing an outlined mark, she gasps and sniffles)"
4,12,Gretchen,"Chill out, Isabella. We've got this. Ready, girls? (She pulls off the top of the hive)"
4,12,Fireside Girls,(Gasp) They're gone!
4,12,Isabella,"Gone? F-f-f-fighting flashforward to potential catastrophe! (Screen ripples, record scratches) Hey, where's Pinky?"
4,12,Admiral Acronym,"Good afternoon, Agent Pinky. I see you've taken our new handbag conveyor system. (Pinky growls) Carla here has intelled that Poofenplotz has been hatching some sort of bee-related evil scheme. Carla?"
4,12,Carla,"Yes, it seems that Poofenplotz is researching the use of royal jelly in the bee community. (Beeping) Oh, there's your coffee."
4,12,Admiral Acronym,"Isn't she a find? She comes from an entire family of unpaid interns. Anyways, see if there is anything to Carla's research, Agent Pinky. Admiral Acronym out."
4,12,Isabella,(shrieks) We've gotta find those bees before the sun goes down! But how?
4,12,Gretchen,"In the guideline for the beekeeping patch, it says that a good beekeeper tries to think like a bee."
4,12,Katie,Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
4,12,Gretchen,What are you doing?
4,12,Katie,I'm thinking like a bee.
4,12,Adyson,I know! We can get stung by radioactive bees and gain bee-themed superpowers!
4,12,Holly,"Um, we don't have access to radioactive bees."
4,12,Ginger,(sarcastically) Yeah. That's what's wrong with that plan.
4,12,Isabella,But we do have access to Phineas and Ferb. And they have access to a sorbet machine that turned Candace into a fly. They've gotta be able to modify it to turn people into bees.
4,12,Katie,Phineas and Ferb have a sorbet machine that turns people into flies?
4,12,Isabella,"Katie, for crying out loud, look it up on the internet!"
4,12,Poofenplotz,Let's see.
4,12,Poofenplotz,"Bill, bill, flyer... (gasps and squeals) This must be my acceptance letter into L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! Oh! (she tears the envelope open and takes out the letter and reads it) ""Dear Esmeralda Poofenplotz..."" Oh, that sounds promising!"
4,12,(Close up on the letter which reads,
4,12,Poofenplotz,"""We regret to inform you that..."" Oh! Reject me, will they? No matter. (she crumples the paper up) My newest evil scheme is sure to catch the attention of that silly boy's club. (Close up on Pinky in his purse. He barks.) Pinky the Chihuahua! (Pinky jumps out of the purse and growls and barks at his adversary.) Fortunately, I was expecting you. (She pushes a button on a remote and a makeup case pops out of the rug trapping Pinky.) The makeup case doubles as as a trap. (She lifts it up.) Could you hand me that lipstick in there? (Pinky gives her the lipstick.) Thank you."
4,12,Phineas,"What are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony?"
4,12,Isabella,Of course! Wouldn't miss it!
4,12,Phineas,"See ya later, then!"
4,12,Baljeet,Did you know that bees can communicate with each other through dancing?
4,12,Ginger,That's really interesting!
4,12,Baljeet,Yes. They do a tail-wagging dance to alert others(?) to a source of food. (in background) The waggle explains the angle to the destination in relations to the imaginary line from the sun to the door of the hive.
4,12,Isabella,"Okay, let's see...setting, targets... (she types in the control panel) ""Fireside Girls..."" And that should do it. (She presses a red button.) Here we go."
4,12,Baljeet,"(looks away from Ginger) In a minute. (Turns around) So to continue, the figure eight and... (Notices Ginger has disappeared) Awwww, annnnnd we are back."
4,12,Isabella,"Fireside Bees, follow your noses!"
4,12,Fireside Bees,(sniffing) That way!
4,12,Poofenplotz,"Mmmmwah. Much better. Now that my lips are taken care of, I can tell you about my beautifully evil plan. (Pinky growls, and Poofenplotz sprays him with a water bottle.) Bad doggie! Okay, sit! (Pinky sits) That's better. Now pay attention as the camera slowly moves closer and we cross-dissolve to my thoughts."
4,12,Poofenplotz,"(voiceover) Behold, a humble beehive. A massively warded society just like our own. Observe a young grub bee fed mass quantities of royal jelly, which will make her larger and eventually she will become queen. So logic dictates that if I were to consume massive amounts of royal jelly, then I would grow four times bigger and live four times longer and eventually be crowned Queen of the World! The Queen!"
4,12,Poofenplotz,"And I shall not be dark, but beautiful, like the night in the day, and all shall love me and despair!"
4,12,Poofenplotz,"(voiceover) And I might have a grotesquely large abdomen for laying eggs, but I can live with that."
4,12,Poofenplotz,"Come, Pinky the Chihuahua! To the Myselfcopter! (She laughs taking Pinky with her climbing into a helicopter shaped in her own image as she flies off)"
4,12,Isabella,My bee instincts are buzzing! This must be where our bees went!
4,12,Gretchen,They must've been attracted to that heavenly scent. What is that?
4,12,Doofenshmirtz,"(talking under) Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. 'Cause you see, it's a-it's a real vacuum cleaner."
4,12,Milly,It seems to be coming from that gigantic perfume sprayer.
4,12,Gretchen,Let's check it out!
4,12,Isabella,"Woah! It looks like every bee in Danville is here! Fireside Girls, forward, buzz!"
4,12,Doofenshmirtz,(He activates the vacuum and all the bees get sucked inside) Ha ha! Sucks to be you!
4,12,Doofenshmirtz,...just shut off this baby—Oops! I almost hit the...
4,12,Doofenshmirtz,(from outside) ...self-destruct button here!
4,12,Isabella,"Wow! Humans really take for granted not being sucked into the nearest vacuum cleaner. I'm gonna see if the queen knows anything. (She buzzes up to the queen bee) Excuse me, Your Majesty, do you have any idea how to get out?"
4,12,Queen Bee,"Not a clue. And without my jelly, I'm way too weak to fly. Ugh."
4,12,Isabella,"Whadaya think, Fireside Girls?"
4,12,Holly,What are we supposed to do now?
4,12,Gretchen,Bee Day's almost over and we're stuck inside a pharmacist's power-vac.
4,12,Isabella,"What? Over? Did you say ""over""? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when we helped Candace get fifty patches in one day? Heck no!"
4,12,Holly,I thought it was only forty-nine.
4,12,Ginger,"Forget it, she's rolling."
4,12,Isabella,"And it's not over now! Cause when the going gets tough... the tough get going! Come on, girls, we've got enough patches between all of us to make this work! We can do this! Gretchen, Milly, Katie, you've got the exploring patch, right?"
4,12,Milly,"Yes, and we can look for a way back out of here!"
4,12,"Gretchen, Milly and Katie",Right!
4,12,Isabella,"(picking up a piece of hair) These pieces of hair and dust are like rope! Holly, Ginger, you girls have the advanced knot-tying patch. What do you think?"
4,12,Holly,We could totally work with that stuff!
4,12,Ginger,And make a sling for the queen!
4,12,Isabella,"And Adyson, you and I have the appliance repair patch!"
4,12,Adyson,Let's hotwire the vacuum and reverse the motor so that it blows us all out again!
4,12,Isabella,(fist bumping Adyson) That's what I'm talkin' about!
4,12,Adyson,There they are! All we need to do is swap those leads to the forward-reverse switch.
4,12,Isabella,Great! How's that sling comin'?
4,12,"Gretchen, Milly and Katie",All good to go!
4,12,Isabella,"Excellent work! Recon Team, is the escape path charted?"
4,12,Ginger and Holly,"Yes, ma'am! Power vac hose located!"
4,12,Holly,Achoo! It was murder on my allergies.
4,12,Isabella,"Bee-youtiful! Prepare for exit, everyone!"
4,12,Doofenshmirtz,Uh-oh! (All the bees surround Doofenshmirtz) Ah!
4,12,Isabella,"Great job, Adyson."
4,12,Adyson,"Uh, thanks?"
4,12,Isabella,"We're going home to the Fireside Lodge! Everybody, follow me!"
4,12,Isabella,Oh! It's wearing off! (screams)
4,12,Isabella,Come on! We're almost there!
4,12,Isabella,Yay! The bees are back! Now we just need to get them back into their hives.
4,12,Milly,"Okay, little bees, go back into your hive."
4,12,Holly,We don't speak their language anymore. We can't communicate.
4,12,Katie,Ooh! I have my semaphore patch! Would that work?
4,12,Adyson,Only if they were on a boat.
4,12,Ginger,Baljeet is the answer.
4,12,Isabella,"Ginger, now really isn't the time t—"
4,12,Ginger,No no no! He told me all about this dance they do to alert each other to a source of food or shelter.
4,12,Gretchen,Like the rhumba?
4,12,Ginger,"No, it's a waggle dance!"

Soon I'll be able to carry out my most beautifully evil plan yet! (she laughs again. Shot of a nervous Pinky from inside the makeup case. He sees a loose thread and pulls it making the bag come apart. Pinky pushes Poofenplotz making the myselfcopter crash land.) Bad doggy! Bad bad doggy! Oof! (Shot from inside the factory. Poofenplotz is flat on her face.) Ooh. That's the last time I buy a cheap designer knockoff trap from downtown. (gasps) I don't believe it! Fortune is smiling upon me like the creepy guy on the corner of 3rd and Main! (She gets up) We're in the royal jelly chamber of the Moist Beauty organic cosmetics factory! Ha ha ha! How unbelievably coincidental. No really, I mean, I couldn't have asked for a better place to crash. Anyway, you have failed, Pinky the Chihuahua, and brought me right to the biggest supply of royal jelly in the Tri-State Area! (She laughs evilly again as Pinky kicks her into the chambers, which pours royal jelly all over her) I....can't move. Well, I...I'm not much larger and I'm not really feeling royal at all. I suppose my plan was predicated on a faulty hypothesis now, wasn't it? I guess there's only one thing to say, and that's: Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua!!"

4,9,Phineas,"Later, Meap!"
4,9,Isabella,"Hey Phineas, what'cha doin'?"
4,9,Phineas,"Oh, you missed it. We were just talking with Meap in the galactic web."
4,9,Baljeet,What is that flashing on your screen?
4,9,Phineas,"Hmm...I don't know. Let's open it up, Ferb."
4,9,Morg,"Hi, my name is Morg. Have you ever wished that you could pop off to another planet, on the other side of the galaxy for a quick visit? Well, now you can! With Mind Share Vacations! Mmm! You and your friends can trade places, with me and my friends, for the interplanetary vacation, of a lifetime!"
4,9,Phineas,That sounds like fun.
4,9,Morg,"Imagine, relaxing in a hot rock by the pools, and then surrounded by beautiful newts! Or splork through the tubeworm forest, of put wishum foomf! Woohoo! Hmm! Here's how it works. Your mind comes to lodge in his head, and his mind goes to stay in yours. Only your mind makes the trip, mmm. All you have to do, is build this highly sophisticated device, and be on your way to priiiii...a mind share vacation of a lifetime!"
4,9,Phineas,"Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today."
4,9,Baljeet,It sounded like he almost said we were on our way to Perry.
4,9,Buford,"Ha ha ha. Hey, where is Perry?"
4,9,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. We have intelligence that Doofenshmirtz may have taken up Square Dancing. He cannot be allowed to use one of our beloved american traditions for his evil purposes! So get out there and make sure he do-si-do...sen't do that, I guess."
4,9,Phineas,"There, finished. Well, that was easier than I thought. Let's fire this bad boy up!"
4,9,Phineas,"Brace yourselves for fun, because we're going on a Mind Share Vacation!"
4,9,Baljeet,Did it work?
4,9,Phineas,I think it did.
4,9,Buford,"Hey, wait a second. (Ferb rolls the backdrop up) Where the heck are we?"
4,9,Baljeet,"Ohhhh, prison. We were on our way to prison."
4,9,Isabella,That's what he almost said.
4,9,Morg,"Hmm! Our escape plan worked perfectly! We are now free to ransack this planet! Everyone, celebration noises!(Morg and his friends make various sounds; the alien in Baljeet's body makes bicycle horn noises. When everyone stops, he still makes noises. Morg turns and stares at him)"
4,9,Morg,"Okay, that's enough!"
4,9,Ferb,It appears as though we've been transported into some sort of...inter-galactic hoosegow.
4,9,Buford,I was framed!
4,9,Phineas,(holding a sauce can) I'm afraid we've been duped into aiding in the escape of some rather brilliant galactic prisoners. And they did it with this little gadget --
4,9,Isabella,"Phineas, that's you!"
4,9,Morg,"That's right losers, mmm! We pulled the old switcheroo! In case you chumps have any ideas about coming back, we're setting the device on our end to self-destruct! In one hour!"
4,9,Alien in Buford's body,Why are we waiting an hour to destroy it?
4,9,Alien in Baljeet's body,Have you no sense of drama?
4,9,Morg,"Sayonara, suckers! Mmm!"
4,9,Buford,Ain't that the squirts.
4,9,Isabella,"Well, look on the bright side! (pause) I got nothing."
4,9,Buford,"Hey, guys, I just realized somethin'! I'm the only fly in a prison full of frogs and lizards!"

4,9,Inmate 2,(offscreen) Fresh fly!
4,9,Inmate 3,(offscreen) We're gonna get you!
4,9,Baljeet,"Well, it was nice knowing you."
4,9,Phineas,"I think I figured out how we can reverse this thing. We'll be back in our own bodies in no time, barring any unforeseen— (alarm blares) What's that?"
4,9,Warden,"Out of your cells, ladies! Surprise inspection! Cell number 12, don't make me come down there! Morg! What are you and your misfits up to this time? What's that? (pointing to the device in the cell)"
4,9,Phineas,"Oh, uh—"
4,9,Warden,Contraband! One more infraction outta you nerds and I will put you all in the hole for good!!! You got it?!!
4,9,Isabella,The guard just took our only connection back to Earth! Now what are we gonna do?!
4,9,Phineas,"I think we might be able to rebuild it, if we could just get the parts."
4,9,Buford,We need to find a guy who knows how to get things. Every prison has one.
4,9,Baljeet,How do you know what every prison ha—
4,9,Buford,Uh-uh!! Don't go there!
4,9,Candace,Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah! Where on earth do you think you're going?
4,9,Morg,We're going to Lotsmo to steal food.
4,9,Candace,What?! Are you pretending to be aliens or something?
4,9,Morg,"Hmm, yes, pretending. Hilarity noises! (The aliens laugh and the alien in Baljeet's body honks repeatedly again) I'm not gonna tell you again! (The alien briefly stops but not before honking one last time, much to the irritation of Morg)"
4,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Gotcha! Ha-ha! I know what you're thinking. Why the snazzy getup? Why the boots? Well, ya see, I met this girl, Rosie, on a square-dancing website and I may have led her to believe that I'm...an expert square dancer. (Perry looks at him scornfully) Hey, don't give me that self-righteous look! It's the web, man! Everybody stretches the truth! You don't think that cat really eats cheeseburgers, do you? Anyway, that's why I made these boots (close-up on the boots) to help me dance. See? They have these little microphones that hear all the commands of the square dance caller and they move exactly to those commands, making me the perfect square dancer! So I really want to make a good impression. Maybe you can come along and, you know, make me look good. What do you say? Will you be my wingman? (Perry just gives Doof a look) There's my guy! Oh, yeah, and by the way, she also thinks I'm a champion bull rider, so if it comes up, you, y-, h-hey, don't look at me like that!"
4,9,Red,"(voiceover) There must be a guy like me in every prison in the universe. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. Dragonflies, a warm rock if that's your thing, or maybe a lilly-pad for your kid's graduation. So when Morg and his friends needed parts for a mind-swap device, (Buford and Baljeet approach the creature with a piece of paper) they came looking for me."
4,9,Buford,"Psst, I understand you're a guy that knows how to get things."
4,9,Baljeet,Stop it! Stop it! What is wrong with you?! Spit him out!
4,9,Red,I'm sorry. I skipped breakfast. What is it you are looking for?
4,9,Buford,(gives him the piece of paper) Here. We made a list.
4,9,Red,(taking out a pair of reading glasses) You can find everything you need in the dumpster out back of the Lotsmo on Flyway 61.
4,9,Buford,So then you can get us the stuff?
4,9,Red,No. I'm not the guy who gets things. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. You would have to tunnel out of your cell and crawl 500 yards through the prison gunge pipe just to reach the outside. That's the length of five football fields.
4,9,Buford,How d'ya know how long a football field is?
4,9,Red,"(voiceover) Later that day, to make their escape, those boys crawled through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness I can't even imagine. (Fade on a shot of a sewer pipe. Phineas crawls out of it into the sewage. He lifts his arms up just like Tim Robbins did in the movie.) Five hundred yards. That's the length of 11 baseball banners, one tennis court, a medium-sized male elephant and a croquet wicket. (While Red is narrating, Ferb crawls out, followed by Isabella. Fade in on a shot of the gang at the dumpster holding some spare parts.) It wasn't long before they found everything that they needed."
4,9,Phineas,Great! Let's hurry up and put this thing together!
4,9,Isabella,"The sooner, the better!"
4,9,Baljeet,"But if we do the mind swap here, those criminals will still be out of jail."
4,9,Phineas,You're right. I hadn't thought of that.
4,9,Red,"(voiceover) So even later that day, those boys crawled back through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness that I—"
4,9,Baljeet,"Actually, it is not as bad as you would think."
4,9,Buford,"Yeah, gunge is actually quite refreshing."
4,9,Red,"(voiceover) Oh. Well, it was still 500 yards. That's the length of two volleyball courts, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, a large three-drawer filing cabinet, three French—"
4,9,Buford,(from inside the pipe) We're not listening anymore!
4,9,Red,"(voiceover) Oh. Okay, then."

(cut to a woman with light red hair and freckles wearing a magenta dress holding a red Solo cup) She's from Hazel Park (whispering) by the racetrack. (out loud) Why don't you go over there and sit with the other wingmen? (cut to outside a barn where three airplane wingmen are sitting and giving thumbs up) And you can, you know, give me hand signals in case I get stuck. Right? (He approaches Rosie) Heh, hi there. I'm...I'm JohnnyRingoenshmirtz217."
4,9,Rosie,"(in a southern accent) Oh, so nice to finally meet you face to face. I must say, I like a man with a strong chin."

4,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that sounds good, too. I mean... Hang on, let me check. (Perry gives him a thumbs up) Let's go!"

4,8,Major Monogram,Psst! Agent P!
4,8,Major Monogram,"I'm in here! (Perry turns and moves to side of the vent Major Monogram is in, and puts his fedora on) Sorry for the break-in protocol, but this is urgent. Show him the photo,Carl."
4,8,Carl,"Yes sir. Here, Agent P. (Slides photo out of the vent, which Perry takes)"
4,8,Major Monogram,"Notice anything unusual, Agent P? Look closer, it's very subtle. (Perry stares down at it, wide-eyed) Here, use this. (Slides out a magnifying glass from the vent, Perry takes it and holds it up to his eye) See that small cluster of clouds? (Camera zooms in on the magnified clouds) It spells ""Doof""! And ""Doof"" is short for ""Doofenshmirtz""! (Perry puts down the photo and magnifying glass) That cloud is directly above the Danville Batanical Gardens! Two hundred acres of ecological diverse natural area. We need you to get out there and find out what Doof is. . .doofing! Here, (slides out a card from inside the vent) take my membership card. (Perry takes it and looks at it doubtfully) You get free parking and you get 15 percent off at the gift shop."
4,8,Carl,"Sir, it says ""non-transferrable"" right at the bottom!"
4,8,Major Monogram,"Oh, Carl, they never look at the photo. Anyway, get out there, Agent P, and good luck! (Perry salutes, then leaves) And make sure to stop and smell the roses! Well. . . he never stops to smell the roses."
4,8,Carl,"I know, sir."
4,8,Buford,"In fact, it was the ancient Tunisians who actually developed many of the techniques still used today."
4,8,Phineas,"Wow, Buford. I didn't realize the wedgie had such a rich history."
4,8,Baljeet,"(offscreen) HEEELP!!! (Runs onscreen) Help! Phineas and Ferb, and to a lesser extent, Buford! I am having an existential emergency! I find myself incapable of making decisions!"
4,8,Buford,(Raises eyebrow) Is that a fact? You'd better sit down.
4,8,Baljeet,Okay. (Sits down)
4,8,Buford,"Come to think of it, maybe your point would be better made standing up."
4,8,Baljeet,"You are right! (stands up and puts finger up, about to speak)"
4,8,Buford,"Then again, you look kind of tired."
4,8,Baljeet,"You are﻿ right. I'd better -- (proceeds to sit down again, but stops as he realizes what Buford is doing) CUT IT OUT!"
4,8,Phineas,"How did you get in such a state, Baljeet?"
4,8,Baljeet,"Well, I was filling out my early college admission forms, and I-"
4,8,Phineas,"Whoa, Baljeet! College is, like, 9 years away!"
4,8,Baljeet,"I said early. Anyway, under personal preferences, I could not decide whether to select 'Loop' or 'String' theory. I was paralyzed with indecision!"
4,8,Phineas,"(gets to his feet) Oh, come on, that's easy! Loop! No, String! No- (Realizes where Baljeet is coming from) oh."
4,8,Baljeet,"Right? Then I started thinking about how important it is to make the right decision on everything! You see, every choice carries with it its own potential timeline. So every decision I make effectively nullifies the possible future! I can't even choose which flavour of ice-cream to order. If I choose vanilla, that may set me on the path to the presidency. But if I have strawberry, I could get hit by a bus!"
4,8,Buford,Well it's simple then. Don't choose the strawberry.
4,8,Baljeet,"You are missing the point! I would not know that I chose strawberry I would get hit by a bus, I am just saying that every decision we make has unforseen repercussions!"
4,8,Ferb,Actually ice-cream sounds pretty good.
4,8,Phineas,Yeah it does!
4,8,Baljeet,"If it is okay with you, I have prepared a little presentation to illustrate my point. (opens up laptop)"

4,8,Phineas,What if you could make both choices? Would that make you feel better?
4,8,Baljeet,Yes! I mean no. I mean yes and no. I mean I do not know!
4,8,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're-"
4,8,Buford,"Wait, let me interrupt you! Where's Perry?"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, I had no idea that making smoke signals was so complicated! (Perry hops onscreen) Perry the Platypus!"
4,8,Ruth,"Excuse me, (scene switches to where two ladies, Ruth and Esther, are standing)you are in clear violation of the garden rules!"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) Docents. (To ladies, causally) So, uh, what seems to be the problem, ladies?"
4,8,Ruth,You are showing blatant disregard for our signage!
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Looks down and realizes that he is leaning on a sign that reads,""Keep Off The Grass"" in red letters) It's all good, ladies. I am a card carrying Danville Botanical Gardens club member. (pulls out card) See? Here's my card! And I'm carrying it!(Esther takes card from him and takes out a laser pen and proceeds to scan the card)"
4,8,Ruth,"Then you should know better, Mr Doofenshmirtz."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Oof!(Exclaims as Esther sharply nudges him in the gut) And i-it's Doctor Doofenshmirtz. Okay, bye! (to Perry) See how cool I was with them, huh? (Perry's eyes flick to the camera, and he gives the audience a doubtful look) So, Perry the Platypus, I'll bet you're wondering why I haven't trapped you yet. It's because I've hired someone else to do it for me! (On cue, a boomerang flies on screen and slams into Perry. Scene cuts to show Perry tied up and suspended from an arbor) Hehe! Perry the Platypus, meet Platypus hunter Liam McCracken! I found him on an evil consultant website."
4,8,Liam,"Semi-aquatic egg-laying mammals, I can't stand the sight of 'em. And you know what? I'll tell you why. (to Doofenshmirtz) D'you mind?"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,No! You know what? Why don't you do the backstory today?
4,8,Liam,"Back in Australia, I had a good life, but platypuses ruined everything. You see, when I was young, (cue ripple effect, flashback to when Liam was a baby. Baby Liam is seen in a stroller gnawing on a boomerang)"
4,8,Liam's mother,"(In flashback, as she pushes baby Liam's stroller) Aww, does he like his boomerang, does he? (notices a platypus near the stroller) Oh my, look at the cute lil' platypus! Hello, cute little fella! (scene changes to show that she and Liam's stroller are at the top of a hill) Hold still! (stroller starts to roll away) That's right. . .  Saay. . . Musk lily!(flashback ends)"
4,8,Liam,. . . And I never saw me mum again. It was on that day that I swore revenge on platypuses.
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"""Platypuses""?"
4,8,Liam,"No, no,  I know, it sounds wrong, but it's actually right."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"I always thought it was ""platypi""."
4,8,Liam,"That's also acceptable. They're vile creatures, not to be trusted. . . (scene cuts to a close -up of his face) . . . the only mammals with poisonous ankle barbs-"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, (turns to Perry) you have a poisonous ankle barb? How come I never knew that?"
4,8,Liam,"Well I'm prepared. I've got my own poisonous ankle barbs. And a little somethin' else up my sleeve. I'd like you to meet the ladies. (Opens up jacket to reveal rows of boomerangs, cue dramatic music. Perry stares at him) (Points to the boomerangs) This here is Nancy, Barbara, Jill, Lauren, (in background) Anne, Nancy, Tracy 1, Tracy 2, Troan, 41, 52, Stacy, Panavise, Jaharrison..."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Turns to Perry) In all fairness, Perry the Platypus, there was nothing in his profile about, you know, naming his boomerangs. Even I find that a little creepy."
4,8,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! Whatcha' doin'?"
4,8,Phineas,"You're just in time, Isabella! In order to help Baljeet with his decision-making crisis, we've built the Infinite Probability Generator. (zoom out to show a giant contraption in the backyard) Once Baljeet's been through the machine's Infinite Imprinter, he'll be fundamentally altered at the probable level. (Candace peeks out from behind the tree, binouculars in hand) Then, anytime he comes to a place where he has to make a choice, (shows Baljeet going into the machine) he'll split into two probability Baljeets."
4,8,Isabella,Allowing him to experience the consequences of both timelines?
4,8,Phineas,"Exactly, Isabella! Hit it, Ferb! (Ferb does so, machine starts to whir and move with Baljeet in it)"
4,8,Isabella,I love it when you guys tamper with the forces of nature.
4,8,Phineas,"I know, right?"
4,8,Buford,Is science happening yet?
4,8,Baljeet,I-I-I a-am fee-eling nau-usea-ated!!
4,8,Buford,"Yep,that sounds like science to me."
4,8,Candace,"(looks through binoculars) Ohhhh, this is so bustable."
4,8,Phineas,"Alright, Ferb, let's get him outta there! (machine stops whirring, Baljeet is lowered, he falls from his seat onto the ground with a splat)"
4,8,Buford,"Now how're ya feeling, Baljeet?"
4,8,Baljeet,Effervescent and frothy.
4,8,Buford,Just like my mom's homemade toothpaste!
4,8,Phineas,"C'mon, buddy, get up! (helps Baljeet up)"
4,8,Buford,How come he ain't split in two yet?
4,8,Phineas,Because he hasn't made a choice yet. (Music is heard)
4,8,Buford,Oh boy! It's the ice-cream guy!
4,8,Isabella,"Oh, I thought it was someone's phone."
4,8,Phineas,"Come on, Baljeet! Let's see if the Infinite Improbability Generator worked!"
4,8,Phineas,"Howdy, Mike! My good friend Baljeet here would like to sample your fine frozen confections"
4,8,Mike,"Alright, Baljeet, what flavour? Vanilla or strawberry?"
4,8,Phineas,"Carpe diem, Baljeet. Carpe diem!"
4,8,Baljeet,"One vanilla- (he suddenly splits in two, Phineas backs away)"
4,8,Second Baljeet,-and one strawberry!
4,8,Mike,Weird. And I've also got banana splits!
4,8,Phineas,"(Laughs) Good one, Mike."
4,8,Mike,Here you go. Vanilla and strawberry. (drives away)
4,8,First Baljeet,Now I am beside myself.
4,8,Second Baljeet,And I like it!
4,8,Phineas,"(Laughs) That's very clever, Second Baljeet."
4,8,Second Baljeet,"Now that I have made both choices, I will no longer miss any opp- (DBG bus returns, hits Second Baljeet) What do you know! I was right!"
4,8,Buford,"Wow, tough break."
4,8,First Baljeet,Yes. . . but that means I am going to become President!
4,8,Major Monogram,Carl? Carl! Where are you?
4,8,Carl,"I'm over here, sir! (pans right to show bigger vent, the one Major Monogram was in earlier)"
4,8,Major Monogram,How did you get over there?
4,8,Carl,I was coming to see you! Why are you over there?
4,8,Major Monogram,I'm trying to get out of here! What are you trying to do?
4,8,Carl,"Well, I was looking for you so that we could leave together!"
4,8,Major Monogram,"Oh, for Pete's sake."
4,8,Liam,". . . Danni, oh, and this shiny girl came all the way from Greece. I call her- (notices that Perry has escaped) What the blazes?!"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(turns and sees that Perry has escaped) See, I told you he was good! Now, about your refund policy. . ."
4,8,Liam,"(to Perry) That hat don't make you special. you're still a platypus. (At this, Perry narrows his eyes and chatters defiantly) I'm gonna make you eat those words . . .(stops uncertainly) or that noise. You and your hat are gonna make a fine addition to my trophy room."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Trophy room? Whoa-whoa hold on a second, I just hired you to trap Perry the Platypus, not- (steps onto trap, trap snaps shut with Doofenshmirtz inside)"
4,8,Liam,"Consider me off the clock, doc. (throws boomerang at Perry, Perry dodges, but it returns, ropes burst out of its middle and trap Perry, while the boomerang returns to Liam's hand)"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"What is this, is this a hammock? If it's a hammock, it's way too tight. (Liam takes no notice, instead grabs rope and starts pulling Perry towards him, Perry struggles and resists, but is unable to, Liam grabs his fedora and slaps one end of a handcuff onto Perry's wrist) Uh-oh, (sticks one hand out of the 'hammock') Mr McCraken, I think you caught me by mistake!"
4,8,Liam,"(slaps other end of handcuff onto Dr. Doofenshmirtz's wrist) No mistake there, doc. You're either with me, or against me. Come to think of it, I don't have a pharmacist on my trophy wall. . . yet."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, whoa whoa whoa, what do 'you mean, ""yet""?"
4,8,Liam,I'm giving you sixty seconds head-start before the hunt commences.
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't even know what you're talking about. (turns to the fedora-less Pery) Who's this platypus? Why am I handcuffed to him? Where is Perry the platypus? (Liam just ignores him) So to recap in order of importance, why am I handcuffed to him?"
4,8,Liam,"So as to make it easier to hunt the both of you. Now, run."
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, fair enough. (is pulled away by Perry) Whooa!! (scene changes to show Perry pulling Doofenshmirtz as they run through the garden, Doof talks but Perry ignores) Wow! You know, I really shouldn't have ignored the ninety-seven percent of customer feedback that says he tends to go rogue. So, I guess we should introduce ourselves. My name is Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and you being a platypus, you can't talk to tell me your. . . you know what? I'm just gonna call you Steven, is that alright? You look like a Steven to me. (stops and sniffs the air, looks off to his right and sees a rasher of bacon hanging in midair) Bacon! What luck! I have really worked up an appetite with all this eluding. (moves toward the bacon, but Perry narrows his eyes at it,hooks his foot around the leg of a nearby park bench and kicks causing it to fall onto the area below the bacon, a trap snaps shut around it. Liam, some distance away, looks up at the recently activated trap)"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Whoa, it was a trap?! I did not see that coming!"
4,8,Liam,"(to boomerang in hand) Alright, Nancy. Don't hold anything back, love. (throws Nancy, Nancy flies and takes a chunk out of a tree near to where Perry and Doofenshmirtz are, tree falls, Perry only just manages to pull Doofenshmirtz out of the way in time, Nancy returns to Liam's hand) What took you so long?"
4,8,Buford,"Alright, you two, let's get somethin' straight here. There'll be NO messin' with the Buford. Don't make no diff how many of you there are!"
4,8,Second Baljeet,"I would never mess with you, Buford!"
4,8,First Baljeet,Neither would I!
4,8,Buford,"That's good, 'cause I've still got ya number! Or would that be 'numbers'? (Candace enters, grabs both Baljeets and leaves) Hey, Baljeet, which one would be grammatically correct? (Gasps as he suddenly notices that both Baljeets have disappeared) How rude."
4,8,Linda,"Finally getting 'round to spring cleaning in the summer. First up, the fridge."
4,8,Candace,"(enters, bringing in both Baljeets, but one of them is blocked by the fridge door) Mom! Look at this! (closes eyes) Look what Phineas and Ferb did!"
4,8,First Baljeet,"Hello, Mrs Flynn-Fletcher."
4,8,Linda,"Hello, Baljeet. (Candace's eyes open) How's your mom doing? (sniffs at a bowl of gray gunk thoughtfully before dropping it into the dustbin)"
4,8,First Baljeet,"Oh, she is doing well!"
4,8,Linda,That's good. That's nice. Would you like a snack?
4,8,Baljeet,Something to drink if you have it.
4,8,Linda,(Opens fridge door) Let's see. I've got some grape juice and orange juice.
4,8,First Baljeet,I would like grape juice.
4,8,Third Baljeet,And orange juice!
4,8,Candace,(gestures to both Baljeets) Mom!
4,8,Linda,"(has her back to them, so she can't see them) My, someone's thirsty. Oh, there's more juice down here. (Bends down) Let's see. I've got... (bends up) pineapple, mango and tomato."
4,8,Baljeets,(as they split) Pineapple! Mango! Tomato!
4,8,Linda,"Ooookay, Baljeet. You weren't kidding, (bends down to show that four Baljeets have collected behind her) you really were thirsty!"
4,8,Candace,Mom!!!
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) Hehheh, I think we lost him, you can slow down now.(Perry stops near a lake) I just said ""slow down"", I didn't say ""stop"". What are you looking at? (Perry stares out onto the lake, a determined look on his face) Oh no, we are NOT going- (cries out as Perry pulls him into the water) Hoo! That's cold! (Perry continues swimming downwards, Doof continues talking with his head out of the water) Wow, you're like a little motorboat there, Steven. (exclaims again as Perry pulls him in once more, Liam arrives at the lake shore, we see him putting on his gear, all of which is platypus-themed. Liam jumps into the water, he takes out a kind of slingshot boomerang and fires it at Perry. Perry sees this, and quickly digs up a large flat stone and uses it to shield himself, boomerang bounces off. Liam grabs Perry's tail, but lets go when Perry swipes him across the face with his ankle barb. Perry and Doof resurface) Wow, Steven, that was sweet! You've really good at that-that barb thing. (Perry suddenly notices something downstream and starts swimming upstream) What? Why are you turning around? Don't go back that way, that put-me-on-the trophy-wall guy is back there. (comes to a water fall) Oh, I see, a waterfall. Just in time for commercial. Isn't that convenient. (Both Doofenshmirtz and Perry go over the waterfall and start falling) What's that all about, anyway? It's not a clifffaller, it's called a cliffhanger, and here we are, falling, and-watch watch watch, here we go, wait, look, yup yup see? There you go! Fading to black!"
4,8,Liam,"I know you're down there, ya platypus. And I'm gonna find ya."
4,8,Doofenshirtz,"(Perry climbs out of the waterfall plunge pool with Doof close behind) Hey! Hang on there, Steven. I'm tired of running. And I don't mean tired like, I need to sit down for a while, I mean although I am tired and I do need to sit down for a- I mean- I'm fed up with that guy! And with your animal instincts and my vast knowledge of science, I think we can make a stand. What do you say? Are you with me? (Perry pauses for a while, then gives Doof a thumbs-up. We then see a montage showing Doof and Perry gathering wooden poles and placing them in a tree, lifting a statue with ropes, Perry stopping to sniff a rose before making use of its thorns to make a rope, which is then twined tightly around some Cattail reeds which in turn, are placed in the lake. Perry is seen moving a stone with his bill to hold them down, Perry and Doofenshmirtxz are seen constructing a cage of some sort with the poles from before and string, Perry climbs a tree to pull some of its bark down. This is used to make a glove, which Doofenshmirtz wears and uses to crush a pear. All of this happens while the dramatic music from the start of the episode plays) Groovy!"
4,8,Baljeet #1,I wonder if the others would like some juice.
4,8,Baljeet #2,We should take some out to them!
4,8,Baljeet #3,What about Buford?
4,8,Baljeet #4,What has he ever done for us?
4,8,Baljeet #5,You mean to us!
4,8,Baljeet #2,Yeah! He can get his own juice!
4,8,All other Baljeets,Yeah!
4,8,Baljeet #1,The jerk!
4,8,Lawrence,"(Walks in) Oh, hello, boys! Are we having a party, Baljeet? And Baljeet and. . . wait a moment, if he's Baljeet you must be. . . ?"
4,8,All the Baljeets at once,Baljeet!
4,8,Lawrence,". . . Oh all right then, carry on! (exits room)"
4,8,Baljeet #4,"So, we are agreed. No juice for Buford."
4,8,Baljeet #2,Yeah! (Stands up) No juice for Buford. Come on! (Runs out)
4,8,Liam,"(sees the sprinklers turning on) Now, what's all this, then? (stands up and walks away as the sprinklers all around him turn on, spraying him) (To boomerangs) Alright, Jill, something's not right. Be a love and have a look around. (Throws Jill, which is caught by glove made by Doofenshmirtz earlier. Liam stands where he is and waits for Jill around, but continues walking forward when she does not return ) Jill? Jill? Where are ya? (turns around and sees Jill wedged in the trunk of a tree) Ah, there you are. I thought maybe you'd taken off from me. (moves to remove Jill from the tree, but find that she is, instead, fastened to the tree by a pull string) What the blazes? (Pull string activates underwater bows, which fire arrows made from the rose thorns and cattail reeds Perry had earlier, which strike Liam. He runs away, crying out in shock and pain. As he runs, he activates a trip wire that causes a water fountain to spray a powerful jet of water at him, while, overhead, a boulder rolls down a track made from two wooden poles and knocks a statue out of a tree, which Liam narrowly dodges. The statue, however, knocks a weighted rope net out of a tree, which falls onto Liam, trapping him successfully) Oof!"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs triumphantly) We did it, Steven! High five!"
4,8,Liam,"So you think you've bested old Liam and his ladies? Sue begs to differ. (throws out a tiny boomerang which cuts the ropes of his net, Liam stands and pulls out another boomerang) I call this one Sharpay. 'Cuz she's sharp, eh? (throws Sharpay, which cuts Perry's and Doofenshmirtz's handcuffs, separating them. Sharpay returns to Liam, who growls in frustration. Freed, Doofenshmirtz and Perry run off) It's all right, Sharpay, I'll give you another chance. (throws, Sharpay, hits Doofenshmirtz, who slams nito a tree.)"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,Whoa!!
4,8,Liam,(catches and pockets Sharpay) That's my girl.
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, ow(clutches knee in pain) . . . Steven!! (Perry, some distance away, on top of a small hill, looks up) Heelp!!"
4,8,Liam,"This looks like a job for Natasha! (Pulls out a giant boomerang from under his coat and throws it. Perry dives, avoiding the boomerang, which sails away into the distance.)"
4,8,Candace,"(walks into the kitchen with one of the Baljeets) Okay, Mom, I'm going to replicate the anomaly right in front of you."
4,8,Linda,"Fine. What is it, Candace?"
4,8,Candace,Look closely. How many Baljeets do you see standing here?
4,8,Linda,"One, Candace. There is only one Baljeet, after all. (Winks at Baljeet)"
4,8,Baljeet,"Why, thank you, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher! That is very kind of you to say."
4,8,Candace,"She's talking numbers, kid. Don't get a big head. Okay, mom, now watch what happens when he has to make a choice. (to Baljeet) Baljeet, would you like some grapes, or this chocolate bar?"
4,8,Baljeet,"Grapes, please. (Takes it from Candace and starts eating, Candace looks shocked when he does not split)"
4,8,Linda,"(with disdain) That's really great, Candace. Now I gotta get back to the fridge."
4,8,Candace,"I don't get it, what happened?"
4,8,Baljeet,I just really wanted grapes! (walks off)
4,8,Candace,UHHHHHGGGH!
4,8,Liam,"(Puts down binoculars) No sign of him. Well, doc, it looks like it's just you and-(a plate flies over and hits him on the head, he picks it up from the ground) Ow! What the blazes?! (reads the text printed onto plate) Danville. . .Botanical . . Gardens? (both he and Doofenshmirtz look up to see Perry carrying a stack of DBG plates in his left paw, Perry holds up Major Monogram's card in his right)"
4,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Steven, you came back. That's right, fifteen percent off at the gift at the gift shop. Nice going, Steven!"

4,8,Liam,"Very clever. But let's see how you do against the (Pulls out seven identical boomerangs) Seven Sisters!

4,8,Isabella,"Something's going on over there, the Baljeets seem to be gathering."
4,8,Phineas,Oh I don't like the looks of that! Gatherings have a bad habit of turning into mobs.
4,8,Ferb,And mobs rarely make good decisions
4,8,Buford,"Oh come on, couldn't a gathering just as easily turn into shindig or a hoot-nanny?"
4,8,Isabella,"Under normal circumstances, I'd say yes. But this one seems to have a ...(Puts her hand on Buford's shoulder, Suspense music plays) ...""Storming of the Bastille"" sort of vibe."

(Perry only smiles in response, and after dramatically whirling Liam's boomerang for awhile, releases it and hits Liam in the head. Liam stumbles back from the blow and collides with a birdbath as the boomerang returns, impressively, to Perry's hand. Liam narrows his eyes at Perry and flings one of the Seven Sisters at him. Perry counters with another of the Seven Sisters, which slices through the branches above Liam, who runs from the falling boughs, only to encounter Perry again, from whom he runs in fright. Perry hurls two boomerangs at him which rip Liam's jacket in flight, causing him to lose all his boomerangs. Liam reaches for his boomerangs but realizes, too late, that he has none and slams into a tree. He ends up at the base of a tree.)"
4,8,Buford,"(Runs back into backyard) Phineas! Ferb! Ya gotta save me! (cowers behind Phineas) They've all gone crazy! (The Baljeet replicas return, marching into the backyard)"

4,8,Candace,"After, like they're going to get him!"
4,8,Linda,"(stops what she is doing) Baljeet picking on Buford? Candace, Buford outweighs Baljeet by like, 90 hamburgers!"

Perry climbs out of the rubble unhurt but Liam swoops in for the kill)"

4,13,Phineas,"Uh, we moved past zombies, Buford."
4,13,Isabella,He's been gone all morning! He didn't even touch his breakfast burrito. What am I going to do?
4,13,Gretchen,We could put up posters.
4,13,Buford,We could do nothing.
4,13,Phineas,We could make a portable positronic canine detector using the olfactory receptors that Ferb and I were gonna use for our milligram scale purification study.
4,13,Isabella,Let's do that one!
4,13,Candace,"You kids have fun. Really, I wish I could stay and bust you but I have a lunch date with Jeremy down at City Hall."

4,13,Candace,"For your information, I'm going down to City Hall because Jeremy's working the Slushy Dawg concession stand at the food court there. And we're gonna have lunch...together. But don't worry, Isabella. I'm sure Pinky'll turn up. Perry always does. Speaking of which, where is Perry?"
4,13,Isabella,And where's Pinky?
4,13,Buford,"And where's that breakfast burrito? (Baljeet plays a rimshot on the drums.) Ah, there's my guy!"
4,13,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. I believe you know Agent Pinky. (Cut to a shot of Agent Pinky, shaking, next to Agent P.) Agent Pinky informs us that Doof intends to steal the deed to the Tri-State Area from the City Hall archives. It seems he's discovered that whoever has the deed automatically becomes the ruler. It's an old law from a simpler time. You'll find that Agent Pinky is quite an asset, Agent P. He's good with computers, covert ops, and, quite frankly, he needs the hours. So get out there and stop Doofenshmirtz! Good luck, Agents P and, uh...P! (Agents P and Pinky leave) I guess you're just two ""P's"" in a pod. (chuckles) Carl, where's my rimshot?"
4,13,Carl,(offscreen) It's right in front of you.
4,13,Major Monogram,"(picks up a flyer with the words ""Ba-Dum Crash"" and a picture of a snare drum on it) How did you do that?!"

You brought your little dog, too! How cute! Oh, FYI, I don't think they allow dogs in here. So, y'know, watch out for that. Anyway, I bet you're wondering why I'm in City Hall, right? Well, I plan to go down into the secret City Hall vault and steal the— Oh, y-you know that, right. (huffs) Right, right, of course. That's probably why you're here. To stop me, right? (opening his box) What you probably don't know is how I will get into the vault without being noticed. (takes out an inator helmet from the box) Behold! My Blend-Into-The-Background-intaor. I will be able to search the vault and steal the hidden deed, because, like they say, it's easier to find a hidden object when you're hidden as well. Right. Th-Th-Th-That's the thing. They say that. Anyway, (puts helmet on) I place the inator on my head, like so, I press this button and, now I'm here (disappears) and I'm blended in (becomes visible again) I'm here, (disappears) I'm gone! (reappears) I'm here, I'm go— Oh, my head! I hope there's no long-term damage from this, but—ugh! Anyway, I bet you think I forgot to trap you. Well, surprise! You're already trapped...by bureaucracy! You see, you don't have a number, Perry the Platypus, so by the time you and your little dog get into the archives, I will already be ruler (disappears) of the Tri-State Area!!

Well, I guess it's not...not all that hidden, then, is it? Well, maybe it's just easier to find 'cause I'm hidden! Yes, I (reappears) knew that was a real saying! Come to Papa! (gasps)"
4,13,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus?! Oh, and your pet dog. How did you escape the clutches of bureaucracy? (Perry holds up a piece of paper with the number ""7"" on it.) Oh, oh, you took a number. I guess the line wasn't as long as I thought. But you're too late! (disappears again) Once I get outside, I will own the Tri-State Area!

Like the queen bee, I have acquired mass quantities of pheromones. See? Right here in the tank. Once I spray myself, the bees will be attracted to me and I will be crowned King Bee! After that, it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to ruling the entire Tri-State Area."
4,11,Stacy,"Okay, so the top three items on the Heather Magazine 11-step guide to be the true emo teen are dark hair, dark clothes, and pencil-thin jeans."
4,11,Candace,Ughh!
4,11,Stacy,Let's see what you got.
4,11,Candace,(weakly) Whatever.
4,11,Stacy,"Well, you got the look and you got the attitude. Now there's just one last test to see if you're a true emo. Do you have enough ennui to resist the urge to bust your brothers? (Candace looks out the window, seeing her brothers building the pool) I don't think your Mom would approve."
4,11,Candace,Of course not! They're gonna be soooooo bus --
4,11,Stacy,"Nuh, uh, uh, true identity, Candace!"
4,11,Candace,(inhales heavily and exhales lower and lower until part of her hair covers her left eye) What's the point? No one understands me anyway.
4,11,Stacy,"Wow, Heather Magazine is good!"
4,11,Isabella,"Thanks for the loan, Phineas! We're sure to get our Beekeeping patch now."
4,11,Phineas,"No problem, what are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony?"
4,11,Isabella,Of course! Wouldn't miss it!
4,11,Ginger,This is fascinating! Tell me more about bee dancing.
4,11,Baljeet,"Really? Because usually, people are either gone or fall asleep by the time I get to this part of the sentence."
4,11,Phineas,"Hey, Baljeet! Mind giving me a hand with these pools?"
4,11,Baljeet,"(looks away from Ginger) In a minute. (Turns around) So to continue, the figure eight and... (Notices Ginger has disappeared) Awwww, annnnnd we are back."
4,11,Linda,"Hi, honey. Love the new look."
4,11,Candace,"You obviously don't know me. Nobody does. And if somebody did, I'd just deny it."
4,11,Linda,"Sweetie, I went through a similar phase when I was your age. Try writing some poems."
4,11,Candace,Whatever.
4,11,Linda,That's my girl.
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,"(carrying a vacuum cleaner) Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. 'Cause you see, it's a-it's a real vacuum cleaner. (Perry gives a look) No? Wow, either I'm off my game or you're just being stubborn. (Doofenshmirtz activates the vacuum and all the bees get sucked inside) Ha ha! Sucks to be you! So we're back in business! Now, lemme just shut off this baby—Oops! I almost hit the self-destruct button here! What? I-I install one on everything. It's my thing. I put one on my coffee machine, on my TV, (cut to a shot of Doofenshmirtz's toilet with a self-destruct button on it) I have one everywhere. (cut back to Doofenshmirtz) I even put one on my underwear. See? Look. (he activates his underwear's self-destruct button) Oof! Oh, that, uh...that was not pleasant."
4,11,Buford,"Alright, gang's all here. Let's get this pool party started!"
4,11,Phineas,"Sorry, Buford, I promised Isabella and the Fireside Girls that we'd wait for them."
4,11,Buford,"(falsetto) ""Ooh, I promised Isabella!"""
4,11,Phineas,Is that how I sound?
4,11,Ferb,He really nailed you.
4,11,Baljeet,It is uncanny.
4,11,Phineas,"Well, I guess we can test the pools out to make sure they're up to our usual standards."
4,11,Buford,"(falsetto) ""Well, I guess we can test the pools! Hey, look at me!"""
4,11,Phineas,"(laughs) You guys are right! It's like listening to a mirror! Alright, gang, let's give this wading pool a try."
4,11,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
4,11,Buford,Woohoo!
4,11,Buford,"(belches, giving a thumbs up) Carbonation. Makes me belch. That's why I like it."
4,11,Baljeet,"(sarcastically) Yes, thank you for sharing."
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Now that the bees are out of the way, let's try this baby out. Just a little spritz. (He activates the Aroma-inator and gets more than just a little spritz.) Uh...okay...needs a little adjustments. (The doorbell rings) Oh, that's right. Charlene's coming over to get Vanessa's headphones for her. (He walks over to the door with the headphones and opens it to reveal his ex-wife.)"
4,11,Charlene,"Hello, Heinz."
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, Charlene. (giving her the headphones) Here ya go."
4,11,Charlene,"(taking the headphones) Oh, thanks, Heinz. Wait, are you more attractive all of a sudden?"
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, why, thank you, I have been trying to—Oh, wait, no, it's just the pheromones."
4,11,Charlene,"Wow! Well, it's really working because suddenly I can't remember why we broke up."
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,You said you hated Mr. Tomato.
4,11,Mr. Tomato,"Hello, Charlene."
4,11,Charlene,"Oh, hello, Mr. Tomato. (to her ex-husband) Thanks for the reminder. (leaves) I'm outta here."
4,11,Mr. Tomato,"Y'know, it wasn't me she didn't like."
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,Shut up!
4,11,Phineas,Awesome!
4,11,Baljeet,What a thrill!
4,11,Baljeet,"(offscreen) Man, that kid can wade!"
4,11,Candace,"Sibling unit,"
4,11,Phineas,"Wow, pithy."
4,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Now we're cookin' with gas! Watch, Perry the Platypus, (Perry throws his fedora. It hits both the forward/reverse switch and the on/off switch) as I spritz myself right into ruining the Tri-State Area! (The Aroma-inator gives Doofenshmirtz a huge spritzing, but he then sees the escaped bees) Uh-oh. (All the bees surround Doofenshmirtz) Oh! Ow! I think it might be time for Plan Bee!! (Perry uses his tail like a chainsaw freeing himself from the swatter trap while Doofenshmirtz is still yelling.) Stop it stop it! (Perry puts his fedora back on) Ah! Ow! They're all over me! Ahhhhh!!! Get 'em off! Get 'em off!!!! (Perry runs over to the remote. He activates the Aroma-inator emptying it completely. The bees follow it.) Thank you for saving me, Perry the Platypus! And on the bright side, with all those bees, not one sting! Ow! (He spits out a bee and sticks out his swollen tongue.) Oh, man! I thould've ekthpected thith. At leatht my inator ith intact. (Perry pushes the self-destruct button on the remote control.) Ah, thhoot! Curth you, Perry the Platyputh! (beat) Curth you! I thaid, ""Curth you, Perry the Platyputh!"" Yeah, well, thee, you thould be able to get it in contektht."
4,11,Buford,What the heck is that?
4,11,Phineas,"I have no idea, but the bees sure seem to like it."
4,11,Candace,"And so continues the inevitability of my mundane existence. (The bees deflate the giant wading pool, squirting water out of it, and soaking Candace) Once again, I am humiliated by the universe."
4,11,Buford,What just happened?
4,11,Linda,"(offscreen) Hey, kids! (Cut to the sliding door where Linda comes out with a tray with a pitcher and some glasses filled with iced tea) Anyone up for some iced tea?"
4,11,Phineas,"Sure! Thanks, Mom! (They run up to the refreshments. Perry enters chattering.) Oh, there you are, Perry!"
4,11,Linda,"Oh, look, you kids found Candace's old wading pool! How sweet!"
4,11,Phineas,"We're gonna have a pool party! Go ahead, wade away!"
4,11,Isabella,"Sorry we're late, Phineas. Our bee ceremony ran long."
4,11,Phineas,"No worries, Isabella. Go ahead and join Mom in the fun."
4,11,Buford,"(falsetto) ""No worries, Isabella!"" (makes mocking noises)"
4,11,Isabella,"(to Phineas) Hey, he does a good you! (to Gretchen and Holly) Come on, girls! Let's hit the pool!"
4,11,Linda,"Aw, it's just like old times."
4,11,Stacy,"(coming in with the magazine) Hey, Candace, (flipping the pages) I just realized you added up your score wrong! Your true teen identity is actually the... (Shows quiz in magazine) ""Busting and Crush Obsessed Older Sister Type Who Can't Do Math""."
4,11,Candace,"(deadpan) But, but, but, but, but...whatever."
4,39,Phineas,An almost perfect day to build another one of our inventions.
4,39,Buford,Hey! Dinner bell! Where do you want this crate of hoojimagawas?
4,39,Phineas,"Right there is good, Buford."
4,39,Baljeet,How about these helicopter blades?
4,39,Phineas,Just lean 'em up against the tree for now.
4,39,Baljeet,"Ten-four, good buddy."
4,39,Buford,Why do you sound like you're in a 1970s road comedy?
4,39,Baljeet,There was a cable marathon on last night.
4,39,Buford,"Oh, I missed it."
4,39,Isabella,Heads up. More random construction equipment for an as-yet-unidentified project comin' in!
4,39,Perry,(chatters)
4,39,Major Monogram,"This rate, I'll be late for my creative writing class. Agent P! No need to walk all the way down here! I'll just give you your mission on the staircase! Doofenshmirtz has been experimenting with image technology! It's very suspicious! We need you to go check it out! Good luck, Agent P! Idea for TV spinoff. Platypus in a staircase."
4,39,Candace,"Stace, the thing with boys is I just don't get them. You think they're saying one thing, but then you don't know if they really mean something else. They're like those Egyptian drawings that no one understands."
4,39,Stacy,You mean like hieroglyphics? Those were deciphered in the early 1800s after they found the Rosetta Stone.
4,39,Candace,"Fine. They're like something else no one understands. Like, how you know that?"
4,39,Stacy,(mumbles) I 'unno.
4,39,Candace,"Okay. Take the conversation I just had with Jeremy. I suggested we go to the movies later and he said ""cool"". And what does that mean? I mean, did he mean like ""Cool, I totally want to hang out with you"" or ""Cool, I really wanna see that movie"" or ""cool"" like ""I think you're being cold and distant""?"
4,39,Stacy,Not that one.
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Over here, Perry the Platypus."
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"So, you fell for the old hat rack disguised as your nemesis"" ploy, eh? Well anyway, that was a very efficient use of my time. I demonstrated my latest inator, and trapped you all in one. Trap Perry the Platypus. Check. Demonstrate inator. Check. And now, that just leaves backstory, light lunch, take over the Tri-State Area, and schedule painters. Only seventy-five percent of my list left. I am on fire today! All right, so let's get down to business. Ever since I switched pizza places, you remember that whole pizza day debacle, right? Okay. Well anyway, my orders now are all showing up cold. Nothing I can do to change that, because, you know, I'm a lousy tipper, so I invented this. The impersonator-inator! An inator so nice, I had to name it twice. Rather than move or shell out extra cash, I can use this device to create a holographic field around myself, impersonate the pizza delivery boy, and pick up my own pizza. It'll still be warm, but then I said Heinz, Heinz, you're-you're thinking too small. Why not think of pizza boy's boss, but then I said Heinz, Heinz, and I said what? I'm right here. Stop saying my name. And then I said why be the pizza boy's boss when you can be the pizza franchise owner? Uh-oh."
4,39,Electronic Voice,Database image transfer.
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Whoops. One pizza delivery boy, comin' up! I don't know who that was for. It was such a good line. It would've been a shame to hold it back. It's uh, oh hush."
4,39,Candace,"Seriously Stacy, boys are a mystery. I mean, what do they talk about when they're not around? Do you think they talk about us?"
4,39,Stacy,I got no clue.
4,39,Candace,"(sighs) I guess I'll never know the real deal as long as I'm not a boy. (gets turned into Gary Frank) Stacy, there's a pizza delivery boy in my room!"
4,39,Stacy,Is that code for something?
4,39,Candace,"Get back! Huh? There's no one there. But he's in the mirror. But, but, (gasps) Oh no. No no no no no no no. This cannot be happening. (gasps) Ah ha! Oh! Oh! Stacy, Phineas and Ferb have turned me into a holographic image of a pizza boy!"
4,39,Stacy,Cool. Can I have a veggie special with non-dairy cheese?
4,39,Candace,(voiceover) Stacy!
4,39,Stacy,"Hey, too bad Jeremy didn't order a pizza. Then, you can hang out with him and find out what guys talk about."
4,39,Candace,Brilliant! (gasps; laughs)
4,39,Stacy,"Just kidding, Candace. Candace! Oh boy, I gotta work on my delivery. It's way too deadpan."
4,39,Phineas,Knowing what we're gonna do today. Check. Wondering where Perry is. Check. We're on fire today!
4,39,Isabella,Did you order a pizza?
4,39,Phineas,Nope.
4,39,Baljeet,"Maybe, he delivered a pizza before you even thought about ordering it."
4,39,Phineas,"Ferb, make a note for later. Time travel pizzeria."
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"And then I thought, why be a brigadier general when I can be a major general? I mean, why not? Right? I'm a modern guy. And then I thought, maybe I'm still shooting too low. Why be a major general when I can be a lieutenant general? And then I thought, why-- (Perry slaps him) Ow! What, do you have a blowtorch under your tail or something? (Perry slaps him again) Ow!"
4,39,Jeremy,37! 42! 74! Hike! Hike!
4,39,Coltrane,Hey hey! I'm open! I'm open!
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) Pizza delivery.
4,39,Jeremy,That didn't count! Pizza interference.
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) Pizza for Jeremy Johnson.
4,39,Jeremy,"Uh, sorry dude. But we didn't order any pizza."
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) You didn't. But your girlfriend did. That's some girlfriend you've got there. I see you're the luckiest man alive to have a girlfriend like that.
4,39,Jeremy,Wait a minute. You look familiar. Do I know you?
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) No.
4,39,Jeremy,You really look familiar. Aren't you?--
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Nope. Just an average hamburger-eating football playin', punchin', gamin' boy. (spits) Boy spit. That's why I did that."
4,39,Jeremy,Wait. You're Gary Frank! You were the most popular senior two years in a row! Dude. You gotta join us for a pizza break. It'll be fun to catch up and talk.
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) Talk. Yeah. Talk.
4,39,All,(laughing)
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) (laughs) That was funny. Belching. (laughs) It's so, uh... (laughs) Male (laughs) Right, bros? But yeah, maybe we should talk about something like, I don't know, does anyone have any deep thoughts they'd like to share?"
4,39,Coltrane,Nope.
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,What?
4,39,Jeremy,"Well, I think... this pizza's really good."
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Oh, I'm so glad. Yeah, I figured you guys would like the supreme meat lover's choice. Though, I wasn't sure about the prosciutto. Sometimes, it could be rather tough. And when it gets in between your teeth, it could be really embarrassing like, (pauses) um... yeah, and that's how I feel about it."
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,What?
4,39,Coltrane,I have a feeling.
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) Great. Let's hear it.
4,39,Coltrane,"I have a feeling if Jeremy doesn't wash that shirt soon, it's gonna be reported as a health hazard."
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,(laughs)
4,39,Jeremy,Oh yeah. Well your face is a health hazard.
4,39,Coltrane,Your breath is a health hazard.
4,39,Candace,(talking like herself) I have really been underestimating Stacy's conversational skills.
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"(looking like Teddy Roosevelt) Okay. I can tell by the way you're looking at me that I'm suddenly the twenty-sixth president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt. Downside is: I'll be succeeded by William Taft. Blech! The upside, Perry the Platypus, is that the hero of San Juan Hill was a heck of a pugilist. Put up your dukes. Come on."
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"(looking like Teddy Roosevelt) Mm, guess the animal setting wasn't such a hot (Perry the Platypus (currently impersonating a gorilla) punches Doofenshmirtz) Ow! Wait. How did you punch me? The hologram was so much taller than you. (Perry picks him up) Ah! Ow! It defies logic."
4,39,(Song,"""Watchin' and Waitin'"" (instrumental))"
4,39,Jeremy,"Yeah! Well, my fantasy league is killin' it this year."
4,39,Candace,(sighs)
4,39,Jeremy,"Thomas got me two touchdowns, twenty-three points last week, and 189 yards. I'm in first place in my keeper league."
4,39,Coltrane,"You're lucky, because I drafted Kimball, but he's out for two more weeks."
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,What?
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) So, uh, what else do we talk about? Mm, let me think, uh... oh, I know. Anyone here have a girlfriend?"
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,What?
4,39,Coltrane,I do. Her name's Stacy. She's absolutely the best girl...
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Not you, I'm asking Jeremy."
4,39,Jeremy,"Duh. Remember the whole ""your girlfriend ordered the pizza"" thing?"
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Oh, right. Yeah. Your girlfriend ordered pizzas. (clears throat) Uh, so, yeah, what do you think of her?"
4,39,Jeremy,She's cool.
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) And what do you mean cool? Like cool how?
4,39,Jeremy,I just mean she's cool.
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) So, cool like, you like her ""cool""? Like she's totally cool to be around ""cool""? Or cool like she's cold and distant?"
4,39,Jeremy,"Uh, those first two. Not that last one. She's cool. She's sweet."
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) You mean sweet like thoughtful or sweet like so sugary or gonna be sick?
4,39,Jeremy,No. I just mean she's sweet. She's nice.
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Nice like she's nice or, what do you mean by that?"
4,39,Jeremy,Just what I said. She's nice. She's cool.
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) So, what you're telling me is that what you say is exactly what you mean? Like nothing more, nothing less, you say it, you mean it, that's it."
4,39,Jeremy,"Well, yeah. What else would I mean?"
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Nothing, I guess. 'Cause we're like dudes."
4,39,Jeremy and Coltrane's friend,What?
4,39,Candace,"(as Gary Frank) Okay, so you know, um... I'm gonna go."
4,39,Jeremy,Great hangin' with you!
4,39,Candace,(as Gary Frank) Yeah. Enlightening.
4,39,Jeremy,Wow. He is not like he was in high school.
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on! (Perry gets turned into a football player) Oh, I get it. Pig skin. Oh great. My -inator has a sense of... (gets turned into a dinosaur while falling to ground) Velociraptor power attack!"
4,39,(Song,"""Leave the Busting to Us!"")"
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great! Where am I supposed to find a paleo-orthodontist?"
4,39,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. Fire it up. (Ferb turns on the machine) Ah. Congratulations, guys. We're the first humans ever to taste blueberry air."
4,39,Buford,"Eh, I'm more of a lingonberry kind of guy. (Candace returns to the backyard as Gary Frank) Hey, you're back. I'll take a large pie with andouille sausage and chocolate chips."
4,39,Candace,First of all: Ew. Why would you eat that? And second: I'm not a pizza boy.
4,39,Phineas,Oh my gosh. It's Candace. With what appears to be a holographic field projection mapped on to her.
4,39,Candace,Why are you surprised? Didn't you guys do this?
4,39,Phineas,Nope. We were just makin' blueberry air.
4,39,Candace,Why blueberry? Why not lingonberry?
4,39,Buford,Exactly. What's that all about?
4,39,Candace,"Uh, well how can I get this off? Buford is like, the eighth person to order pizza from me. And that's not even how you order pizza."
4,39,Phineas,"Well, we didn't do it. But we'll be glad to undo it. Side project, gang."
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,No! No! Not the -inator! I totally need that!
4,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Who's this nincompoop? (realizes he called himself a nincompoop) Oh, right. CURSE YOU, PERRY THE PLATYPUS,..."
4,39,Doofenshmirtz (cont'd),"...and-and the football player, the gorilla, and Lulu Jones, and Blanca Dishon and Director Dipthong. Everybody! Curse you all!"
4,39,Phineas,"Okay. We have everything we need for a holographic field disrupter. We'll build it, and you'll be totally... (Candace changes back to herself) Back to normal!"
4,39,Candace,Cool. Thanks guys. Bust you later.
4,39,Buford,I guess my pizza orders aren't goin' in. WON'T SOMEONE THINK OF THE BUFORD?!?!
4,39,Candace,Hello?
4,39,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. I just wanted to thank you for sending over the pizzas. That was really cool."
4,39,Candace,Cool! You liked it?
4,39,Jeremy,"It was awesome. So, we still on for the movies tonight?"

4,39,Jeremy,What did you mean by that?
4,39,Candace,Exactly what I said.
4,38,Isabella,"(from inside) Thanks for showing me the old scrapbooks, Nana. (cut to her with Nana and other senior citizens.) I love hearing about the old days. Tell me again about string art. And what was it like to get up and change the channel on the TV?"
4,38,Nana's Friend,"Oh, that's so cute, honey. Look at how old-fashioned I still am. I'm writing a letter. By hand."
4,38,Isabella,Why don't you just text or call them?
4,38,Nana Shapiro,"Hoo-hoo-hoo! You kids know nothing of the lost art of letter writing. Back when we were young, we expressed our truest feelings in letters."
4,38,Nana's Friend,Yes. You can tell someone how much they meant to you without worrying about getting interrupted. Or losing your nerve.
4,38,Nana Shapiro,"Or hiccuping. That was my problem. When I was young, I had a crush on a certain boy, and I wrote a letter telling him how I truly felt. That boy ended up being your grandfather."
4,38,Isabella,"Wow. I've been wanting to tell someone how I feel for a long time, now."
4,38,Nana's Friend,Really? I've got an extra pen and paper!
4,38,Nana Shapiro,"Now take your time, deeply state your feelings, and express your... (Isabella hands her the paper)"
4,38,Isabella,I've been scripting this thing out in my head for years.
4,38,Nana Shapiro,"Perfect time, and the postman's here."
4,38,Isabella,"Add this to your bag, my good sir. (hands over the letter about her true feelings about Phineas) So Nana, when Grandpa got your letter, did he come running to you and sweep you into his arms?"
4,38,Nana Shapiro,"What? Oh no. I never mailed it. I'm not brave like you. I mean, he would've laughed at me or shown the letter to his friends. Can you imagine the embarrassment?"
4,38,Isabella,(gets nervous) Oh boy!
4,38,Linda,"Hon, why do you have all these boxes of take out food thingys?"
4,38,Lawrence,"It's such a waste to get rid of them. See? Look. Chopsticks and Ponzu sauce. That's Japanese but-but look, there's also a Chinese fortune cookie, that's what's known as fusion."
4,38,Linda,Okay. I'm hungry.
4,38,Lawrence,Oh. Let's go get some food. Would you kids like to come along?
4,38,Phineas,"No thanks, dad. We had fusion for breakfast."
4,38,Lawrence,"All right, then. I'll clear all these drawers and boxes out later, darling. See you, boys!"
4,38,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb! Let's do dad a favor and clear these drawers and boxes out for him! Oh, look at this! It's like a spoon and a fork together! What would you even call that?"
4,38,Ferb,"In the UK, they call that a ""foon""."
4,38,Buford,They do not!
4,38,Phineas,"It's a perfect fusion of aesthetics and utility. It's like a little work of art. Ferb, I..."
4,38,Candace,What? What are you doing?

4,38,Candace,"You're doing a chore? No way are you getting all the parent points. I've got chores to do, too. Carry on."
4,38,Baljeet,"You know, the drawer in our kitchen is full of honey and catsup."
4,38,Buford,"Yeah, and ours has red pepper flakes and little tubs of grated cheese."
4,38,Phineas,"Well, go home and grab it, guys! We're gonna make some art! Hey, where's Perry?"
4,38,Major Monogram,"Agent P, it seems that Doofenshmirtz is into astrology now, and that makes him very dangerous to us. I know what you're thinking. I was like you. I always thought horoscopes were a bunch of hooey. But then, I read my own horoscope. I'm a Sagittarius. It said, ""It's a bad to get a haircut"". How spooky is that? I had my haircut yesterday. Today would be a bad day to get a haircut. How do they know that stuff? If Doof figured out the astrological science of our agents, he could predict our every move!"
4,38,Carl,"Excuse me, sir. I believe horoscopes are meant for entertainment rather to be taken as fact."
4,38,Major Monogram,"Of course, you think that, Carl. You're a Capricorn. You know what to do, Agent P."
4,38,Isabella,"(in her head) Oh, come on, Isabella. What's so bad about writing a letter and expressing my feelings? Feelings are natural. Phineas is natural. We are both natural beings in the world. What feelings? (back to normal) Aw. (in her head) Did I really refer to him as ""my little crumb cake""? Who does that? (back to normal) Come in, Fireside Girls!"
4,38,Holly,"Go ahead, chief!"
4,38,Isabella,"I just mailed a letter stating my true feelings to Phineas and we need to stop him before he reads it! This mission is top priority! I call it ""Operation Crumb Cake""!"
4,38,Ginger,Crumb Cake? Is that what you called him?
4,38,Isabella,"Oh boy, it's worse than I thought."
4,38,Baljeet,Wow. Artsy.
4,38,Phineas,Yeah. We're really getting into it. Who knew that making an art piece out of old take out stuff would be so fun?
4,38,Baljeet,It is almost like Tadashi Kawamata's massive chair sculpture in Abu Dhabi.
4,38,Ferb,"Or the Sub Lyric Pile Killabuster with Onion on Marble in Salzburg, Austria."
4,38,Baljeet,Really?
4,38,Phineas,"Actually, I think he just made that one up."
4,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. Could you be a sport and shut the door? It gets really drafty in here. Give it a good slam. Sometimes it sticks."
4,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha ha! Betcha never dreamt you'd get caught in a dream catcher. Actually, Norm made that this morning. Who knew he was so crafty? Anyway, my astrologer believes that when Mercury is in retrograde, anything can go wrong and usually does. And, you know, she's always right, she has dark hair and bangs, and you know, as it turns out, Mercury has been in retrograde all summer. No wonder my evil schemes keep failing! And that is why I invented the Unretrograde-inator! You know, to reverse my bad luck. And I know that Unretrograde is sort of a double negative. It sounds like I'm making Mercury go forwards but I'm actually sending it backwards from going backwards which happens to look forward but it isn't. You know what? Basically, it's a Reverse-inator but... Unretrograde-inator! It sounded more astrology-y. Look. You know, I'll just show you how it works. Oh Norm! Could you come over here for a moment?"
4,38,Norm,"I'm almost finished cleaning up your mid-morning piñata, sir."
4,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah yeah. Qué bueno, Norm. Now, just stand right there."
4,38,Norm,Oki-dokie. (gets zapped by the -inator) Oh my! I have a sudden urge to dump your piñata pieces back on the floor.
4,38,Doofenshmirtz,It works!

4,14,Major Monogram,"Well, I'm, uh, I'm particularly partial to number three."
4,14,Doofenshmirtz,"And I like number seven, that's my lucky number. (The background starts to ripple.) It all started when I was seven years old, back in Drusselstein—"
4,14,Kelly Osbourne,W-W-Wait a minute. You're doing a flashback.

4,14,Kelly Osbourne,That's great. But—
4,14,Doofenshmirtz,So what are my co-hosting duties? What's next on the old co-hosting train I jumped aboard? What do I do?
4,14,Kelly Osbourne,"Say goodbye, Dr. D."

4,15,Buford,"Woah woah woah! We're just startin'?! No—no intro, nothin'?! Just gettin' right into it?"
4,15,Phineas,"Yep, we're just doin' the knot."
4,15,Buford,"Wait, how can we do something not?"
4,15,Phineas,"No, it's ""knot"" spelled with a ""k""."
4,15,Buford,"I didn't think it was spelled with a ""k""."
4,15,Phineas,"No. It's ""knot"".....spelled with a ""k""."
4,15,Buford,I don't understand your pauses.
4,15,Phineas,"Well, lemme start over. Today, we're gonna reproduce the Gordian Knot."
4,15,Buford,"Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?"
4,15,Isabella,"I've heard of that, but I can't remember the story."
4,15,Buford,I got this. Back in the day where men wore miniskirts...wiggle wiggle wiggle...wiggle wiggle wiggle...
4,15,Buford,"(voiceover) ...Alexander the Great was vacationing in Gordium, when he came upon a celebrated oxcart that was tied to a post using a knot that was so complicated, it was impossible to untie. So he just sliced it in half in one bold stroke."
4,15,Buford,"A simple solution to a complicated problem, hence the phrase, ""Cutting the Gordian Knot."""
4,15,Isabella,I've never heard that phrase!
4,15,Baljeet,That is new to me.
4,15,Buford,"Trust me, it's a thing."
4,15,Phineas,"So, we'll tie these ropes around our waists, and follow this blueprint to recreate it, then it's up to us to figure out how to get loose. That'll make us the second people to tie the Gordian Knot, but the first people to untie it!"
4,15,Baljeet,What if we cannot untie it?
4,15,Phineas,(tying his rope around his waist) No problem. Our mom was always really good with knots. There was this one time when Candace—
4,15,Candace,(leaning against the door) Hey! I thought we weren't going to bring up the clothesline incident ever again!
4,15,Phineas,"Oh, right. Anyway, would you mind getting Mom if we get stuck in the ginormous Gordian Knot we're making?"
4,15,Candace,"When it gets big and weird, I'll go get Mom."
4,15,Phineas,"Excellent! Does everyone have their ropes tied? Alright, lessee, Isabella and Buford, make two loops where you're standing. Great! You're good to start climbing. Baljeet, turn twice counterclockwise and then dive in five loops from the bottom. Then Ferb and I will do this and this and this, and we'll join you inside."
4,15,Ferb,Shall we?
4,15,Phineas,"Absolutely. Let's go, bro! Baljeet and Ferb, twist to the right and wiggle towards the top. Hey, where's Perry?"
4,15,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P! Seems that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been hitting every all-you-can-eat buffet in town, which can't be good! If anything were to happen to Doofenshmirtz, we would have to make some drastic cuts over here! (looking aside) Especially in the non-essential personnel department. (Perry starts to vacuum all the dirt off the chair.) Good luck, Agent P. Oh, don't worry about the mess, uh, Carl will take care of it."
4,15,Carl,"(off screen) I guess that makes me essential, huh?!"
4,15,Major Monogram,"Don't get cocky, Carl."
4,15,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
4,15,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy. What a nice surprise! (sees the safe) Ooh, what's that?"
4,15,Jeremy,"Oh, it's an old mini safe of mine that I found in the back of my closet. I've had it for ages, but I haven't used it in so long that I forgot the combination. I thought your brothers could open it. I figured that's a ""safe"" bet. Heh heh!"
4,15,Candace,So what's in it?
4,15,Jeremy,That's the thing. I don't remember.
4,15,Candace,Maybe it's a rare baseball card.
4,15,Jeremy,"No, I sold all those a long time ago."
4,15,Candace,"Um, could it be your favorite toy car from when you were a kid?"
4,15,Jeremy,"No, I traded that for this safe."
4,15,Candace,"Well, maybe it's something cute, like your baby teeth."
4,15,Jeremy,Nope. Definitely not. I still got those. (He lifts his upper lip to reveal his baby teeth stuck in his gums.)
4,15,Candace,"Ew. I mean, cute!"
4,15,Jeremy,"Yeah, the Tooth Fairy never visited me when I was a kid. (pause) Anyway...could you give this to your brothers? I gotta rush to work."
4,15,Candace,(takes the safe) Sure. I'll give it to them as soon as they finish their Ferbian Knot. Don't ask.
4,15,Jeremy,"(leaves) See ya later, alligator!"
4,15,Candace,"In a while, crocodile!"
4,15,Stacy,You guys have got to work on your pet names for each other. So what's in the safe?
4,15,Candace,I dunno. But it's not baby teeth.
4,15,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"" (Jazz Waltz Version))"
4,15,Phineas,"(off screen) Okay, everybody. Two twists to the left and we should all see daylight."
4,15,Isabella,"(coming out of the knot) Well, I just earned my Overcoming Claustrophobia Patch!"
4,15,Buford,Ugh! Daylight! Ha ha!
4,15,Baljeet,Now what?
4,15,Phineas,Now we burrow back in and untie ourselves.
4,15,Buford,"You gotta be kiddin' me! Who looked at this idea and said, ""Yeah, that'd be fun""?! Y'see?! This is what happens when we have no intro!"
4,15,Baljeet,I have been making mental notes of the paths and probabilities as I have gone along. It will be a piece of cake.
4,15,Isabella,"If I just walk backwards, it should work."
4,15,Buford,To heck with this game! I'm just gonna chill here for a while. (gets pulled into the knot) Hey!!! Who's pullin' on my rope?!
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Over here, Perry the Platypus. (Cut to Doofenshmirtz at a table with a Dagwood sandwich on it and a high chair sitting next to him.) I'm just having a little lunch. Why don't you pull up a chair and join me? (He sits in the chair and, of course, gets trapped.) Whadaya think? Pretty clever, right? It's my new high chair trap! I thought of a high chair cuz you're just a little guy. Arencha? Yes you are you're just a lil' guy. (Perry chatters angrily.) Hey, you're not getting outta this so why don't you enjoy the food. (Doofenshmritz force feeds Perry part of the sandwich.) It's All-You-Can-Eat, you know. (stops) Uh, ih, you're good? (Perry nods.) You're already full, right? Me, too. I barely touched my plate. That's how these all-you-can-eat places make their money. They charge you like you're gonna eat a week's worth, but then, when you fill up after, like, two plates, they-they've really made a profit. That's why I'm opening up my own All-You-Can-Eat Drusselsteinian buffet! (Shows him a video on a smartphone) Look. I've already made a commercial for it."
4,15,(Song,"""Kronk for Hire"" (instrumental))"
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"All You Can Eat Drusselsteinian Buffet! It's food the way your mother never made! We've got Hassenfloffer Entrail Waterzooi, with Gopher Gut Au Gratin! Fuzzy Fungus Flugelbrotchen! And an assortment of tripe-based desserts! And those brave enough can try our new Mystery Lump! Remember, ""Doof"" spelled backwards is ""fooD""!"
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Y'know, come to think of it, it really should be called ""the All You Can Stand"", because Drusselsteinian food is terrible! That's the beauty of it. Nobody will be able to finish even one plate's worth! My profit margin will be HUGE! But, first, I've got to eliminate the competition, with this, (Takes out an inator) the Eat-It-All-Inator! You see, it gives people a huge appetite and everyone will eat so much that all of these All You Can Eat places will go out of busineeessssss! Then my restaurant will be packed! (Maniacal laughter) Maniacal laughter!"
4,15,Candace,Whadaya suppose it is?
4,15,Stacy,It's probably some dumb boy stuff like firecrackers or turtle shells.
4,15,Candace,"Or maybe it's his secret inner thoughts written as a sonnet. No, no, no, no, that's not it! I gotta think more like my brothers. Y'know, use my imagination."
4,15,Stacy,This could be dangerous.
4,15,Candace,Maybe it's a secret spy plan. Or a glass eye! Or Abraham Lincoln's beard!
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, just watch what happens when I zap those people over there. (Perry jumps in his high chair causing Doofenshmirtz to fire off his inator. The ray bounces off a sneeze guard, off a lamp and hits Doofenshmirtz.) Huh? What happened? How could I miss? Oh, I'm so hungry all of a sudden! (He munches his way through the Dagwood sandwich on his plate finishing it whole.) Oh, that was great! I...I can cut out the middleman and do all the eating myself! (gets up) I'm going down for seconds. (He digs into the entire buffet. The man who was about to get his helping opens up a bag of chips. Cut to Doofenshmirtz eating other people's plates.)"
4,15,Man,How can you eat like that and stay so thin?
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I built an All-You-Can-Eat-inator that speeds up your metabolism so you don't gain any weight no matter how much you eat ever."
4,15,Man,"You should mass produce that machine! Everyone would buy one! Well, you'd be a millionaire!"
4,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Pfft, don't worry about me making money, mister! I've-I've got a complicated plan. I—Like I'm gonna take advice from some guy in a diner."

4,15,Buford,I am so in love with her right now.
4,15,Baljeet,What?
4,15,Buford,Nothin'.
4,15,Ferb,That's a solution to the Gordian Knot even Alexander the Great couldn't come up with.
4,15,Linda,"Alright, Candace, what am I looking at?"
4,15,Candace,I ate it! It was the size of the house and I ate it!
4,15,Linda,You ate it?
4,15,Candace,"I know, I don't believe it either!"
4,15,Linda,"(looking at the safe) Well, what is that?"
4,15,Candace,It's a safe. I can't open it.
4,15,Buford,"Gimme that thing! I got an opener that can open anything! (He hits himself on the head with the safe, which opens.) ¡Para usted, señorita!"
4,15,Candace,"(takes out what was in the safe) A pencil?! This is what I've been obsessed with all day, a pencil?!!"
4,15,Jeremy,"Oh, I remember that! In grade school, a pretty girl loaned me that pencil and I've kept it ever since."
4,15,Candace,A pretty girl? (angrily) Who was she?
4,15,Jeremy,"Candace, that pretty girl was you. See, those are your teeth marks."
4,15,Linda,"Okay, Candace. You can eat the rest of that pencil. Unless you'd like to join us all for some chocolate triple layer cake."
4,15,All but Candace,Yay!
4,15,Candace,Ugh! Ohhhhhhh...
4,15,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry!"
4,15,Jeremy,"Hey, my baby teeth just fell out!"
4,15,Buford,(giving the safe) Why don't you put 'em in here?
4,15,Candace,Ew. I mean cute!

4,29,Danny Jacob,"Dude, somebody's gotta play it, right?"
4,29,Candace,"You know, universe? If you're gonna give me practically unbustable brothers, you could have at least made them not morning people. Yeah, I see ya down there. Hey, where's Perry?"
4,29,Major Monogram,"Sorry you had to pull that all-nighter, but we really appreciate you filling in for Agent Q. With most everyone at Agent-Con this week, we're, uh, a little shorthanded."
4,29,Lyla,"Yet again, I am the only girl."
4,29,Major Monogram,"Anyway, Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been experimenting with energy fields and it's starting to get dangerous. It knocked out our microwave oven. Get out there, Agent P, and right that ridiculous wrong. (Perry gets up and tiredly walks to his spy car. Monogram holds up a breakfast burrito on a plate.) This breakfast burrito is like a bean and cheese icicle except that it's larger and wrapped in a tortilla."
4,29,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?"
4,29,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella! You're just in time to help us build a zip-line tennis game across town for the ultimate game of sky tennis!"
4,29,Ferb,Or skennis for short.
4,29,Phineas,"Now that you're here, we can play doubles for twice the fun!"
4,29,Buford,I'll be the judge of that.
4,29,Phineas,Perfect! 'Cause we need you to be the line judge.
4,29,Buford,Judge? Cool! Do I get one of those powdered wigs?
4,29,Baljeet,No.
4,29,Buford,"Ah, I'll do it anyway."
4,29,(Cut to,)
4,29,Norm,"Woof! Woof! Intruder approaching! Woof! Woof, woof!"
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Good boy! I love this new guard dog software. It's about time, Perry the Platypus. I was beginning to think you found another evil scientist to fight. Oop!"
4,29,Perry,Zzzzzzzzzz...
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, what a little angel. I'll just have to tell you my evil plan subliminally, like, like when people listen to foreign language CDs in their sleep. I did that once and now I can totally speak Portuguese to sleeping people. Anyway, recently, I was musing to myself about how lucky my brother, Roger, is."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Luck is called ""stinkelkrampen"" in Drusselstein and it turns out I never have any of the good kind. Turns out that every object has a positive or negative energy field. I harness that positive and negative energy and created..."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,...the Stinkelkrampen-inator!
4,29,Perry,(yawns) Zzzzzzzzz...
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Shh shh shh shh shh. You see, what I'll do is I'll zap myself with good luck and then I'll go zap Roger with bad luck, then I will ascend to become the Mayor of Danville and then I will rule the ENTIRE TRI-STATE..."
4,29,Perry,(yawns) Zzzzzzzzz...
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"I will rule the entire Tri-State Area. Aw, man, Norm, I told you, on the paper! On the paper! (Cut to reveal that Norm is drawing on the wall) Bad dog!"
4,29,Phineas,"Looking good, guys! All we need to do is hammer in this last nail and we'll be ready to go. (The gang gets zapped by the Stinkelkrampen-inator and the top of the hammer falls off.) Huh, that's odd. Glad I always carry a spare. (The hammer falls off and hits Ferb's shoe.) Whoa! Good thing you're wearing your steel-tip sneakers."
4,29,Ferb,"Actually, today I'm not. (beat) Ouch."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"And that is how the bad luck setting works. Except, of course, I won't be shooting random blasts off the balcony. Now, check out the good luck settings. And, again, I won't be just shooting it off the balcony like this. (He shoots it.)"
4,29,Candace,Time to embark on my daily 500-brush-stroke marathon to manageable hair. (She gets zapped.) One...What the—? (Takes out a protractor to measure her hair.) A perfect 40º angle? (smiles) I can't believe it! A perfect hair day! I finally got my PHD!
4,29,Lawrence,"(carrying pillows) Oh, that's wonderful, honey. Not a single day goes by when I don't appreciate my PHD."
4,29,Candace,"That's great, Dad, but I'm not talking about a degree."
4,29,Lawrence,"Oh, neither am I."
4,29,Candace,Time to take my perfect hair to a bust show. (Cut to downstairs. Her phone rings.) Hello? You're kidding! I won a random contest to sing backup for Love Händel at the Danville 24 Hour Music Awards?! Sweet! Perfect hair day? Backup singer for Love Händel? That could only mean... Wait. Lemme try one last thing. (Falls backwards. Wide shot to reveal she landed on two pillows. She gasps.) Pillows magically appear to break my fall! It's true! I'm finally having good luck!
4,29,Lawrence,I was using my PHD. My Pillow Hurling Dexterity.
4,29,Candace,"Meh. Still lucky. (gasp) I'll actually be able to bust Phineas and Ferb today! Oh, wait. Mom's at that weekend-long plant-potting retreat. (Her phone rings.) Hi, Mom! The seminar's over already?"
4,29,Linda,"Yeah, apparently, you just put some dirt in a pot. I don't know why I cleared my whole schedule."
4,29,Candace,Great! See you at four! (off the phone) Yes! Today is the day that I bust Phineas and Ferb! Woohoo!
4,29,Phineas,"I just don't get it. Everything we try to do either falls apart, breaks, or somehow ends up backwards."
4,29,Baljeet,"I know this goes completely against all logic and therefore makes it totally out of character for me to say, but I think you may have been cursed with bad luck."
4,29,Phineas,(gasp) Bad luck?!
4,29,Danny Jacob,"Dude, I call 'em like I see 'em."
4,29,Phineas,"Hmm, bad luck. That's a new one!"
4,29,Isabella,It happens. There's not much you can do about it.
4,29,Phineas,"No! There is something we can do about it! If we can create algorithms to predict bad luck, we can make allowances for it and still have fun!"
4,29,Baljeet,Just like the failsafe systems on space capsules or airplanes!
4,29,Phineas,Exactly! We'll make having bad luck fun!
4,29,Isabella,Cool!
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, it's time to go. Luck and cover. (He shoots himself with the inator and chuckles.) Good stinkelkrampen tickles! (gasp) Look, a penny! It's working! Aw, man, tails! Well, you know the rules, Heinz. Turn it over for the next person."
4,29,Man,"I say, a lucky penny! Thanks for the flip, old bean. Here is a thousand dollars!"
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"(squeals) It worked! Hee hee! Ooh, time to give Roger a dose of bad stinkelkrampen he'll never forget!"
4,29,Phineas,"Okay, team, all failsafe systems are in place. Go! Yeah!"
4,29,Sports Announcer #1,"What a great day for sky tennis, huh, Markus?"
4,29,Markus,"Or ""skennis"" as the locals call it, Mark."
4,29,Mark,(voiceover) Phineas and the gang have the ball in play so here we go!
4,29,Markus,"(voiceover) Lob to Phineas and Ferb as Phineas sets up for a powerful return! Ooh, looks like Baljeet is set up perfectly for—"
4,29,Baljeet,AAAAAAAAHHHH....
4,29,Markus,Oh no!
4,29,Mark,What rotten luck! Let's just hope Baljeet survives the fall. But Isabella is right there with the save!
4,29,Markus,"(voiceover) And apparently, so is Baljeet. A beautiful airbag maneuver, Mark, which bounces him right back into the game."

4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"(takes some) Thank you! Mmm, mmm, I could get used to this good luck thing. It's better than having a genie. That was a mistake."
4,29,Wienershmirtz,That wasn't a wish! It's just a song! It's not even a song! It's a jingle!!
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh. Y'ever try to sue a genie? Oh, you're asleep. W-Well, let's try to see what kind of tunes are on the FM dial."
4,29,(Song,Dancing in the Sunshine)
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"(while the song plays) Hey, I love this song! I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point, but what the hey?"
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"I love it when the song ends right as you reach your destination! Not to mention the free cans of almond brittle that I got during the chorus. (Cut to inside City Hall.) Well, hello, Roger."
4,29,Roger,"Hello, Heinz. What can I do for you?"
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, little brother, you have had nothing but good luck your whole life, and I'm here to even things up for once!"
4,29,Roger,"Oh, Heinz, the power of positive stinkelkrampen is the result of hard work, strong networking and thoughtful actions in matters both business and personal."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,Pfft! I prefer to inator my way to success...just like I wrote in my book! Available in dollar bins everywhere!
4,29,Mark,Now let's see what Ferb can do with Isabella's blistering smash. Wow! I've never seen a racket spontaneously become unstrung!
4,29,Markus,Ferb's shot is headed straight for Isabella and she...
4,29,Mark,"(voiceover) Oh, that is a tough break! She's flying right past the gap. This is absolutely amazing!"

4,29,Mark,(also getting out of his chair) Which totally exists. Let's get outta here!
4,29,Linda,(offscreen) I'm home!
4,29,Candace,"Hi, Mom!"
4,29,Linda,"I know you wanna drag me to the backyard right now, Candace, but can it wait until I repot my new plant?"
4,29,Candace,"(offscreen, sarcastically) No prob, Mom, Take your time."
4,29,Linda,"Oooookay....Uh, thanks, hon. I—Oof! (She bumps into a jacket and a fedora drops onto the potted plant revealing itself to be none other than Planty the Potted Plant himself!) Oh, how cute! My new plant looks like a little secret agent! Huh. How about you guard this alcove, Mr. Secret Agent Plant. (giggles)"
4,29,Major Monogram,"Sorry, Planty the Potted Plant, but apparently your cover's been blown. I'm afraid you'll have to be repotted with another family."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, Roger, prepare to suffer the bad luck of the dra— (Roger gets up from his desk) Hey, hey, hey! Hey, wait! Wait a minute! You're s'posed to stay still for a good inatoring!"
4,29,Roger,"Aw, but I just realized I haven't said hello to your little platypus friend."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,Careful. He gets a little testy if you wake him up from his nap too soo— (The floor creaks and Perry suddenly wakes up.) Uh oh.
4,29,Roger,"Aw, yes. I'm not a morning person either."
4,29,Phineas,"Great game, guys!"
4,29,Candace,"(from below) Hello, brothers! (cut to her with a pie) I made you a pie...for your Bust Day!"
4,29,Phineas,"Well, that can't be right. (takes out a flyer) Bus Day isn't until next week. (Cut to the flyer which reads: ""Celebrate Bus Day Next Week"" with a yellow bus with a happy face on it) Guess she's getting a head start."
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh no. Now my luck's gonna go back to normal...which is, of course, bad!"
4,29,Candace,"Just take your time, it's not like the earth is gonna open up and s-wallow it, (chuckles, tosses pie in the air) not today! (splat!) Oof. (gasps) Oh no! That means... (runs into the house) MOOOOM!!! MOM MOM MOM MOM!"
4,29,Phineas,And right after Candace said that couldn't happen.
4,29,Buford,Yeah. That's borderline creepy.
4,29,Linda,"Candace, you still haven't explained why you're covered with pie."
4,29,Candace,"Oh, just come on, this will explain everything! A-bu-bu-wuh?"
4,29,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
4,29,Candace,A-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu...but...
4,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, my luck may be back to normal buit at least I still have an entire trunk full of delicious almond brittle. (Opens a can and fake snakes pop out.) Ugh. Mental note: Never accept canned confections from a guy in a clown suit."
4,17,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, we can cross that one off our bucket list."
4,17,Buford,Hey guys! What'cha doin'?
4,17,Phineas,"Uh, I think the bigger question is: What are you doing, Buford?"
4,17,Buford,I'm filling in for Isabella while she visitin' her grandparents in New Mexico.
4,17,Baljeet,"The dress was all his idea, though."
4,17,Buford,"Hey, I got the legs for it. (takes off wig) Ah, New Mexico. My great grandfather once saw something mysterious in New Mexico..."
4,17,Buford,"(voiceover) There he was, happily plying his trade, cowpunching."
4,17,Buford,(continuing) It was a dangerous in profession.
4,17,Buford's grandfather,Darn tootin'
4,17,Buford,"And then one day, he saw it."
4,17,Buford's grandfather,What the Sam Hill?!? Huh?!?
4,17,Buford,It was the elusive Chapricobra.
4,17,Phineas,The what?
4,17,Baljeet,"Based on his extensive history of malapropisms, I would say that he is talking about the Chupacabra, the Latin American goat sucker, that is said to haunt the deserts of Mexico and South-Western America."
4,17,Phineas,"That's just a myth. Like the Lake Nose Monster, and Klimpaloon, the magical old timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas."
4,17,Baljeet,"Umm, have you not proven those things to be true?"
4,17,Phineas,"So we have. (to Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna search for an elusive creature that tends to slip away unse -- hey! Where's Perry?"
4,17,Carl,"I-Is this thing on? I want to thank you all for taking some time outta your busy schedules to attend our compulsory O.W.C.A. Animal Sensitive Seminar. However, if you currently are an animal, you may be excused to your missions."
4,17,Major Monogram,"What -- what -- what? They get to go? What is this, Pick On the Higher Species Day?"
4,17,Major Monogram,"What? Humans are a higher species, everybody knows that!"
4,17,Carl,"And...that's why you're here today, sir."
4,17,Phineas,"Gentlemen and gentlemen, we present to you the Chupa-Copter!"
4,17,Buford and Baljeet,Wow! Right on! Etcetera.
4,17,Phineas,"Alright, everyone! Take your seats and buckle up! We're off to New Mexico to find the elusive Chupacabra!"
4,17,Baljeet,But what are we going to use as bait?
4,17,Buford,"Oh, I got that handled. (He picks up an Isabella suit.) Check it out! It's reversible! (He turns the suit inside out) Tada! A goat costume!"
4,17,Phineas,"Alright, then! Let's start trackin' us a chupacabra!"
4,17,Computer,"Searching chupacabra traits: Rooting, sniffing, long neck, desert dwelling."
4,17,Phineas,"Ferb, let's light this candle!"
4,17,Candace,Look! Everything in my wardrobe is jinxed!
4,17,Stacy,Jinxed?
4,17,Candace,"Uh-huh. I was wearing this one when the boys made a giant gelatin monster. I was wearing this one when the boys split me into like 50 mes. And this one is from the whole Meap thing. And this one... Well, I just spilled grape juice on it. (Indistinct) But still..."
4,17,Computer,Begin analysis. Rooting.
4,17,Candace,(gets out a perfume bottle) Ooh. Je Bust Number 12. (she sprays some on herself)
4,17,Computer,Sniffing.
4,17,Candace,I guess I could wear this tonight.
4,17,Computer,Long neck. (The picture zooms out.) Non-desert dwelling. Not chupacabra.
4,17,Candace,Wait. Somebody's judging me. (she looks outside the window. The chopper flies away) PHINEAS AND FERB! YOU ARE SOOOOOOO BUSTED!!!...For something!
4,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, hello, Perry the Platypus. You like the new Bi-plane? Pretty sweet huh? Uh, I got it off the internet. (Perry gets trapped under a hair drying machine) Don't worry about your hat; the heat is really good for the felt. Look what I invented... (pours a tonic on a mannequin which regrows its hair he chopped off) It grows your hair back. Got it in all the stores, but it's not selling it like I thought of it. That is why it got a catchy name: Get back hair."
4,17,Doofenshmirtz,"It should be flying off the shelves. I-I just don't get it. Anyway that is about to change. Behold, the Switch-Place-inator. Wha- Why do you look so unimpressed? I'll explain. I simply fly over town in my biplane, Ride off! And I look for someone with a receding airline, standing next to someone with a full head of hair. I fire, and presto! The hair switches places. The person who was formally hairline challenged, is thrilled, and the other guy is- well he's gonna spend a lot of money to get his hair back. Thus, Get Back Hair."
4,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Here, I'll show you how it works. Okay, Perry the Platypus, how would you like to trade places with a hungry, man eating shark? (Doofenshmirtz zaps the two with the -inator, causing the shark to flail on the floor, whil Perry swims happily in the shark's former tank) Oh yeah, you're semi-aquatic. Well, I've got some other tricks up my sleeve. Like switching places with a- (The shark, flails around, and manages to bite Doofenshmirtz's upper body) Aw, ah man, I did not see that coming. (Doofenshmirtz throws the shark off him) Okay Señor pantalones inteligente, that's, Mr. Smarty Pants... Spanish. (He fires his -inator switching the places of a lightbulb, and the tank. The tank flips and falls, trapping Perry under it) ""Tanks"" for playing Perry the Platypus. See ya' around."
4,17,Phineas,"Okay guys, welcome to New Mexico. Ferb, let's lower the chupacabra bait. (They lower Buford in his goat costume)"
4,17,Buford,(bleats) Hey! Hey! Watches the cactuses. Ow! Ah! Who's driving up there?
4,17,Phineas,Baljeet?
4,17,Baljeet,(He laughs nervously) Sorry.
4,17,Doofenshmirtz,"(Flying in his biplane) Now to go make my millions with my trusty Switch-Place-inator! Where is it? (He sees Perry has it, and Perry shoots himself and a bird, switching their places, and making Perry fall into Doofenshmirtz's plane) Perry the Platypus, you didn't by any chance hand it over, it belongs to me. Give it, give it. (They begin fighting and doing other things on top of the wing, such as fishing) This is what I call ""fly fishing"" (or teaching Perry to ride a bike) Haha! Yes! Yes! Attaboy! (Throwing Perry a party) Make a wish. (Perry blows out the candles) What'd you wish for (Perry resumes beating up Doofenshmirtz) Really, that's what you wished for?"
4,17,Candace,"I'm going to wait right here until the bustees return. Oh, and they will return."
4,17,Stacy,"Sooo...since you're in busting mode, I take it, my services are not required? (Candace does not answer) Yep, I'm superfluous. (leaves)"

4,17,Baljeet,Does your mom have any goat-based food products?
4,17,Phineas,I don't know. Can't hurt to check the fridge.
4,17,Candace,Now's my chance! (runs up to the crate) Woo! Evidence at last! Wait a minute. Let's just make sure it's really in here. (opens the crate) Here Chupa... (The Chupacabra scratches her in the face) This is the best day EVER! (she stops for a moment) Wait a minute. I'd better move this to the front lawn where Mom can see it right when she gets home.

4,17,Candace,"Awesome, thanks! (hangs up) Whew, now all I do is wait. While I sit on top of the crate for safe-keeping."

4,17,Phineas,"I don't get it. He usually shows up by now. Oh, there you are Perry. You'll never believe this, but for a while there, we had a real, live Chupacabra. (they take out their smartphones) Here, we took pictures."
4,17,Baljeet,Next...next...next...next...
4,17,Ferb,"Well, I guess perhaps the universe wants somethings left un-photographed. Like Chupacabras, or...group photos where everyone has their eyes open."
4,16,Phineas,"So this rock climbing wall will be big! And, best of all, it'll be built of all-natural, an 100% organic, free-range yard trimmings!"
4,16,Baljeet,So is it only rock climbing wall?
4,16,Phineas,"No, it's not only rock climbing wall. It's free-range organic rock climbing wall!"
4,16,Baljeet,"I can see how that would be relevant if we are going to eat it. We are not going to have to eat it, are we?!"
4,16,Phineas,I guess if we had to we could...
4,16,Buford,Did I hear we're building something we can eat?
4,16,Baljeet,"You know, for the record, I would like to not be in a position today, where I have to eat this wall."
4,16,Phineas,"We'll see what we can do, but we're not making any promises."
4,16,Candace,"Mom, have you seen my other white skirt? (Looks at the list) What are those charts?"
4,16,Linda,"Hon, the rare and elusive, bent-bill knot-hatch is in it's nest building season. The birds will be done traveling North, and should be right here in town today!"
4,16,Candace,Snores-ville.
4,16,Lawrence,"No dear, the bird took a left at Snores-ville, and is up here in Danville. Can I get up high? (Candace high-fives Lawrence)"
4,16,Linda,"Woo! Okay, more specifically, it should be right in our backyard at exactly four today! Isn't that exciting!?"
4,16,Candace,Wait wait wait wait wait! So you and a bunch of trained observers are going to be in our yard at exactly four in the P.M. today?
4,16,Linda,"Well, yes."
4,16,Candace,"Love it! The Booby-hatched trash-nut whatever it is, is my new favorite bird! This is awesome, see you guys later."
4,16,Linda,(To Lawrence) See? She thinks it's fun.
4,16,Lawrence,"Oh, yes and I'm British, and so you think I'm supposed to like bird watching. (Imitating a British accent) Oh, I'm British, so I'll in the conservatory with tea and a crumpet. I'm saying that ironically but actually that sounds quite good. So I'm going to do that. Ta."
4,16,Candace,(outside in the backyard) Oh yeah. Yeah. This looks good. So how long 'till you're done with this contraption? Think you'll still be out here at four?
4,16,Phineas,I don't know. I guess so.
4,16,Isabella,(sadly) Hi Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
4,16,Phineas,"Hey Isabella, rock climbing wall."
4,16,Isabella,"Well, I just came by to tell you that I can't join in on the fun today. I've been charge of the task of recording the audio book version of the Fireside Girls Compendium Guide, it's gonna take forever."
4,16,Baljeet,That book does not look so intimidating.
4,16,Isabella,"Dude! This is just the table of contents. The actual book is being transported from a secret bunker to a recording studio at the Fireside Girls Lodge. (The book is seen being air-lifted into the lodge) Seriously, this is going to take me a week."
4,16,Phineas,"Hey, we can help. We'll just put this rock climbing wall off 'till tomorrow."
4,16,Candace,"Wait. What? No! You guys keep working, I'll narrate the audiobook. (To Isabella) You stay here and help the boys. Not only will I finish recording your book today, I'll do it by four o'clock."
4,16,Isabella,"So, let me get this straight; You'll do all the work, while I spend the day with Phineas? Mmm.... Deal. But do you know anyone who can work a state-of-the-art soundboard? Someone who can edit huge digital files? Someone who can understand basic mic-ing techniques?"
4,16,Candace,"(annoyed) What is it, Irving?"
4,16,Irving,"Okay, I'll do it. But only if Isabella says ""where's Perry?"""
4,16,Candace,No deal.
4,16,Irving,"You drive a hard bargain, I admit."
4,16,Isabella,"It's okay, I was about to ask that anyway!"
4,16,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. we're getting reports that there is a distinct smell of confectioner sugar, and icing coming form Doofenshmirtz's building. He must be up to something evil and sweet. Sweet and evil. ""Sweevil"" if you will. Go and stop him."
4,16,Irving,"...and put your headphones on. Fireside Girls Compendium, page one, and take one. Whenever you're ready."
4,16,Candace,"Ma May Me Mo Mu. Topeka, Kansas. Topeka, Kansas. (Cut to reveal those are the actual words printed in the book.) Man this is the worst book dedication ever. How we doing in there Irving?"
4,16,Irving,Levels are fine.
4,16,(Song,"""The Fireside Girls"" (instrumental))"
4,16,Candace,"Page one. Welcome Fireside girl. You're about to embark on a trans-formative journey that you will remember for years to come. (Later) ...and water should be boiled. Now on to part two of the introduction. (Later still) (hoarsely) Section 12, part 6. How to start a fire using only bobby pins and a hat. (Even later) Section 25, part 16. How to tell if a marshmallow is properly roasted. (Candace stumbles, and coughs dryly.)"
4,16,Irving,Can I get you some water?
4,16,Candace,"Maybe. (She glances at the clock) N-Keep it rolling, keep it rolling. (She continues) Beginning Section 25, part 17."
4,16,Phineas,"Okay, gang. Is everybody all strapped into their harness."
4,16,Baljeet,Ready! But it is also the worst wedgie I have ever had.
4,16,Buford,Oh really?
4,16,Baljeet,Present company excluded.
4,16,Phineas,All righty then. Let's go.
4,16,(Song,"""Rock Climbing Wall"")"
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Why if it isn't Perry the Platypus. And when I say ""isn't"" I mean ""is"". I know you're into martial arts. But I prefer the confectionery arts myself. (A gingerbread house falls on Perry) Gingerbread house trap. (Peeking through a window in the house)"
4,16,(Song,"""We Wish You A Merry Christmas"" (Evil jingle version, instrumental))"
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey it looks a lot bigger on the inside than it does on the outside. Here, have some cozy gumdrop slippers. Hehehe. Now where was I? Oh yeah. I think I know why I'm having a hard time taking over the Tri-State Area It's because of dinner parties. Follow me, it goes somewhere. You see my brother Roger is a success, because of his amazing dinner parties, where he dazzles important guests, with his magnetic charm. But what if he were unable to charm anyone, because his fabulous dinner parties were over, before they began!? That's why I created this: the Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator! You see everyone knows that once the dessert comes out, the party's over. T-That's what's called a social cue. This rocket will go into a Rogercentric orbit around his house. At the wrong moment it will shoot a blast which will make Roger bring out the dessert. Ending his dinner party before it can begin. He'll lose his charming edge, and people will lose interest, in him. Bing-Bang-Boom. They'll stop voting for him, and that's when I'll slink in and takeove-- You know, I know I'm grasping at straws here, and ugh. I'll probably end up grasping a bendy-straw, and fall on my face, requiring months of rehab to learn how to monologue, all over again (Perry throws one of the gumdrop shoes at the Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator, hitting Doofenshmirtz with the ray) and off to empowerment camp, where I'll have to fall backwards-- Who want's desserts? (Doofenshmirtz goes off and grabs a few desserts) I made this lovely tiramisu. Heeey... It works! Oh you think you're very funny Perry the Platypus, blasting me with my own Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator. (Perry throws his other shoe at the -inator) Oh-ho-ho. I hope you left some room! I made a yummy double layered pumpkin cheesecake it has creamy-- Oh! You got me again. Well you made me bring it to you, so you're going to eat it. (Doofenshmirtz shoves a dessert at Perry, who bites Doofenshmirtz's hand) Ow! (Perry's cage breaks, but the -inator zaps him) Haha. Now it's your turn to bring out the-- (Perry leaps toward Doofenshmirtz, and he smashes the tiramisu into his mouth, sending them both flying back into the kitchen)"
4,16,(Song,"""Weaponry"" (instrumental))"
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"How about a banana split? (He shove a banana split down Perry's bill) Haha! Finally got your just desserts. What are you doing with that pound cake? I was saving that for company! (Perry forces Doofenshmirtz to eat the entire pound cake) Oh! Oh wow! Perry the Platypus, I'm getting such a sugar rush! How 'bout you? (Perry is shown to be having a sugar rush as well)"
4,16,Candace,"(in a hoarse voice) In conclusion, may your Fireside Girl experience be a treasured one with memories for a lifetime. The end."
4,16,Irving,Umm... I'd like you to do one more take on that last chapter.
4,16,Candace,I'd like to hurt you.
4,16,Irving,That's a wrap!
4,16,Buford,Hey guys! I can see my thoughts! They're all sparkly and spread out around us.
4,16,Baljeet,It is the lack of oxygen; it makes you light-headed.
4,16,Phineas,I think it's time to climb down.
4,16,Baljeet,"Ha-ha, coming down!"
4,16,Buford,"Oh I get it, we're in space. AAAAAGHAAGH! I heard that."
4,16,(Song,"""Platypus Walk"" (instrumental))"
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Can you do this, Perry the Platypus? Can you jump really fast, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down? Yeah, that's it, Perry the Platypus! Doesn't it feel good? Let's be jumping buddies. Let's just eat dessert and jump up and down and up and down and up and down all day. It'll be our thing. Just remember: I-I invented this. Because I am the inventor."
4,16,Candace,(In the backyard) Yes! it's still here!
4,16,Phineas,Hey Candace! How'd it go?
4,16,Candace,"I finished recording, Irving's uploading it to the Fireside Girl mainframe as we speak"
4,16,Isabella,Thanks so much Candace!
4,16,Candace,"Yeah, yeah. Now the important thing to get Mom out here. (Hoarsely and quietly she yells) Mom! Mom!"
4,16,Phineas,Do you want me to get Mom?
4,16,Candace,"No! No. You stay here. Nobody move. If we leave, this thing'll disappear. She'll be out here in two minutes, with her bird watching group. I'll wait."
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump. (Doofenshmirtz collapses) Aww. Oh, sugar crash. (The -inator starts beeping) Oh! The Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator it must be almost time for Roger's dinner party to begin. (Doofenshmirtz sees Perry on the floor) Haha! Sugar crash! (The -inator launches) There she goes! And you can't do anything about it, because you're on a sugar crash. (Perry takes a plate of food out from under his hat.) Wait! Wait, what is that? Protein, and carbohydrates? No, well don't eat that! (Perry does so anyway) No! (Perry chases after the -inator on his jetpack) Okay, but, but let's do that jumping thing again sometime."
4,16,Linda,"(To her bird watching group) Okay gang, everyone follow me outside. The bird should be right-- (Linda gets hit with the -inator) Hey, who's ready for dessert? Doesn't that sound good?"
4,16,Lawrence,"Oh, see now? Brits like dessert."
4,16,Bird Watcher Male,Does this mean she wants us to leave?
4,16,Bird Watcher Female,"Well according to social convention, I guess."
4,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Welcome Perry the Platypus. What took you so long? I'm speaking to you through this amplifier right next to the self destruct button. The rocket will soon be in orbit around my brother's house, ready for the next dinner party. And you can ride that rocket until your tail falls off, I don't care. Or until you find the self destruct button which is right next to (Perry presses the button) Aw, dang it! Curse you Perry the Plat-- (The -inator explodes) ...typus."
4,16,Candace,Mom! (She takes out her cellphone and calls Linda)
4,16,Linda,Candace?
4,16,Candace,Mom! Mom! Come outside!
4,16,Linda,"Hon, I can't here you. Let's talk in a minute. (She hangs up) Who wants this a la mode?"
4,16,Candace,Mom! (She runs inside)
4,16,Isabella,Look! Ooh! It the rare bent-bill knot-hatch! Isn't she beautiful? (The bird begins to pick at the rock climbing wall) She's finding material for her nest.
4,16,Phineas,"Well, I guess they've got a lot of nests to make. We did build the thing out of pressed twigs and lawn clippings."
4,16,Ferb,Nature's little recyclers at work.
4,16,Candace,"(Seeing the rock climbing wall has gone) What? What? No! But, but but..."
4,16,Linda,"Oh, honey, I see it! (The rare bent-bill knot-hatch is shown to be on top of Candace's head) Don't move. Hold still. (Linda takes a picture) Got it! Oh, Candace, I wouldn't have seen it, if you hadn't grabbed my forcibly, and pulled me out here. Thank you! So, you kids want some dessert?"
4,16,Phineas,Yeah!
4,16,Ferb,"Some tea with honey would help that throat. And, there's crumpets in the conservatory as well. (He walks off)"
4,16,Candace,He's so British.
4,16,Phineas,Let's go!
