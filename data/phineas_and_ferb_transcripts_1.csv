1,27,Lawrence,"And that is why the 18th century sewing thimble was not only a slice of history, but a compelling example of American grit and perseverance. Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Yes?"
1,27,Phineas,"Great, Dad."
1,27,Betty Jo,"Oh, that was wonderf... (She fake snores)"
1,27,Linda,Mom!
1,27,Betty Jo,"Oh, I'm kidding! Hon, your speech is gonna be a big hit at the antique thimble symposium."
1,27,Lawrence,It's gonna knock 'em dead.
1,27,Linda,"Uh, which we're gonna be late for if we don't get on the road! Thanks again for looking after the kids today. Candace is skating at the park, all numbers are on the fridge."
1,27,Lawrence,"Be good for your grandparents, boys!"
1,27,Phineas,Bye!
1,27,Grandma Betty Jo,You wanna go down and embarrass your sister at the park?
1,27,Phineas and Clyde,Yeah.
1,27,Stacy,"You got it, Candace! You may be rusty, but you got it!"
1,27,Candace,"Uh, I can't turn around...or stop, but I got it! I wonder if Jeremy's skating here today. Does this helmet make my butt look big?"
1,27,Phineas,See? I told you Ferb was a good skater.
1,27,Betty Jo,"Ooh, that's my boy!"
1,27,Stacy,"Hey, isn't that your family?"
1,27,Clyde,Yoo-hoo!
1,27,Betty Jo,Hello!
1,27,Phineas,"Hey, Candace! Jump in!"
1,27,Candace,"I am so not with them! Turn me around, Stacy!"
1,27,Phineas,"So, Grandma, where did you get the moves?"
1,27,Betty Jo,"Well, boys, I was quite the skater in my– (She skates into someone) Oof! Watch where you're--"
1,27,Woman,(Gasps) Betty Jo? Of the Tri-State Bombers?
1,27,Betty Jo,Hildegard? Of the Saskatoon Slashers?
1,27,Hildegard,"I thought I smelled the last of you back in '57, when I whipped your sorry behind, took the trophy and became the rightful Queen of the Derby!"
1,27,Phineas,"Whoa, Grandma, you were in the rollerskating derby?"
1,27,Betty Jo,"Not only was I in it, I was champ! It was years ago."
1,27,Betty Jo,"(Narrating) The night of the final match between the Bombers and the Slashers. We were on our final lap. What was left of my team used our signature move ""The Whip"" to send me to the finish line. Hildegard's team had the same idea. The trophy was mine until..."
1,27,Betty Jo,You only won because you cheated!
1,27,Hildegard,"""Anything goes"", remember?"
1,27,Betty Jo,"Well, what do you say we try it again, cheater?"
1,27,Hildegard,"Anytime, anywhere."
1,27,Betty Jo,You skate like a water buffalo!
1,27,Hildegard,(in background) You couldn't win a race against a one-legged stuffed owl.
1,27,Betty Jo,(in background) Take your teeth out or I will do it for you!
1,27,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
1,27,Jeremy,"Uh, Candace? Why is my grandma yelling at your grandma?"
1,27,Candace,That's your grandmother?
1,27,Hildegard,"Come on, Jeremy. You and your little sister are on my team. Suzy!"
1,27,Suzy,"Yes, Grandma?"
1,27,Hildegard,"Me, you and Jeremy are a team. Got it?"
1,27,Betty Jo,"So I need two of you kids on my team, okay?"
1,27,Candace,"Well, you can have Phineas and Ferb, Grandma. I'm not–"
1,27,Suzy,"But it's not fair, Candace. Our team has two girls and one boy, so you need to be on your grandma's team so it's fair. Cause it's not fair if it's two boys and one girl against two girls and one boy, so you have to skate, Candace, or else it won't be fair."
1,27,Phineas,"Then it's you, Ferb, and Grandma! You'll make a great team!"
1,27,Candace,B-But–
1,27,Jeremy,"I guess it's set, then. We gotta do it for our grandmas. Right, Candace?"
1,27,Candace,"Yeah, (She chuckles) right."
1,27,Suzy,"Psst. See ya on the track, chump!"
1,27,Candace,"Yeah, great. Hey, wait! There's nowhere to have a rollerskating derby, remember? The old derby track got torn down and turned into a tattoo parlor!"
1,27,Phineas,Leave the rink to us!
1,27,Major Monogram,"Hmm. Uh, nice entrance, Agent P. But you do realize there's an elevator over there, right? Okay, just pointing it out. Doofenshmirtz is up to something. I want you to get out there and put a stop to it."
1,27,Candace,"I can't be part of this race. I mean, what if we win? Would Jeremy still like me?"
1,27,Stacy,All I know for sure is boys hate to be beaten by girls.
1,27,Clyde,"There you are, hon. You know where your dad keeps his glue gun?"
1,27,Candace,"Glue gun? What are they up to? Later, Stace. I knew it! I just knew you would be up to something by now. Et tu, Grandpa?"
1,27,Clyde,"No, I just had one. There's more if you want."
1,27,Candace,"Oh, just wait until Mom hears about this!"
1,27,Betty Jo,Heads up!
1,27,Candace,Oof!
1,27,Betty Jo,"Lace 'em up tight, dearie! We've got a score to settle. Win! Win! Win! (She growls)"
1,27,Phineas,Yeah.
1,27,Clyde,"Ooh, yeah."
1,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Will you cool it with the noise, Perry the Platypus? I've got a splitting headache. I was at this evil mixer until late last night, it was crazy. Can you hang out for just one moment? I'm almost there. Hold on. (Doofenshmirtz presses a button, and a cage falls on Perry) Ow! Oh, I've got to get a quieter trap. Now that you're trapped, I will tell you my evil plan. I'm miserable because I can't grow facial hair. It all started when I was about 15. (He begins to flashback, but then stops) Oh, you know, my head hurts too much for a flashback. Anyway, I've tried everything to grow facial hair. It's all so painful. I hate people with beards, et cetera, et cetera. So, who do they erect a statue of right next door? Rutherford B. Hayes, our 19th president! Only the president with the best facial hair of all! Just look at that thing. There's no beard like 19th century beard, Perry the Platypus. Anyway, that horrible statue must be destroyed as it is a constant reminder follicular failure! Oh. Give me just a moment, Perry. This hurts me more that it hurts you. Literally."
1,27,Betty Jo,"...And then on the final lap, we'll use The Whip to send the weak skater. (to Candace) No offense, honey, but that's you. Over to the finish line—To victory!"
1,27,Stacy,All I know for sure is boys hate to be beaten by girls.
1,27,Jeremy,"Candace! Have you no mercy?! Come on, Grandma. Let's go home."
1,27,Betty Jo,"And remember, honey, show 'em no mercy!"
1,27,Candace,What am I going to do? I can't beat Jeremy's grandmother. And I can't let my grandmother lose.
1,27,Phineas,(On intercom) Skaters to their marks!
1,27,Candace,"Oh, great. Maybe I'll get lucky and get hit by a bus."
1,27,Phineas,"(As an announcer) Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's main event. The ""anything goes"" grudge race of the century between Grandma Betty Jo and Grandma Hildegard. I'm Phineas Flynn, and I'll be your announcer for today's action, along with our color commentator, Grandpa Clyde!"
1,27,Clyde,"Yellow, green, blue!"
1,27,Phineas,"Excellent color, Grandpa."
1,27,Clyde,Glad to oblige.
1,27,Phineas,"And now, let's rock and roll-erskate derby!"
1,27,Hildegard,"Remember kids, two words..."
1,27,Candace,Oof!
1,27,Hildegard,...road kill!
1,27,Betty Jo,"Come on, honey! We've got butt to kick!"
1,27,Phineas,And they're off!
1,27,(Song,"""Ring of Fun"")"
1,27,♪ 'Cause she's lacing her boots up at 4,00 A.M. everyday ♪
1,27,Phineas and Clyde,(Smash their guitars) Yeah!
1,27,Phineas,And we're back! Grandpa?
1,27,Clyde,"Orange, purple, chartreuse!"
1,27,Doofenshmirtz,"So, Perry the Platypus, in order to rid myself of that horrid, bearded statue, I've invented the... (He pushes Perry's cage but soon stops) Ugh. Perry the Platypus, this is so heavy. Can you just step out for a sec? I've invented the Bread-inator! Not only will this machine emit a ray that will turn Mr. President into whole-grain bread, it will also release a flock of hungry magpies that will devour the doughy statue! Beard go bye-bye! (He laughs maniacally) Ow, ow. Aw, my evil head."
1,27,Phineas,We're coming to the end of the race. The crowd is going nuts!
1,27,Betty Jo,"Come on, Candace, time for The Whip!"
1,27,Hildegard,"Okay, one, two, three!"
1,27,Suzy,"Go catch her, Jeremy!"
1,27,Phineas,It's Candace and Jeremy neck and neck as they come down the strait.
1,27,Suzy,I don't think so.
1,27,Jeremy,"Wow! Candace, you've  got to teach me how to skate like that."
1,27,Phineas,"Oh, wait! Candace and Jeremy are back in the race, but they're going the wrong way! (Suzy begins to backpedal to avoid Candace and Jeremy) And now, Suzy is going the wrong way too! At least Ferb's still going the right way! (Ferb gets swept up by the Candace/Jeremy/Suzy rocket train going the other way) Oops, spoke too soon."
1,27,Betty Jo,"And don't even think about any rough this time, sister, or I'll kick your fat–"
1,27,Phineas,"And it's Betty Jo pulling away! It's Grandma Hildegard coming up on the shoulder! (Hildegard lands on Betty Jo's shoulders) And by ""shoulder"" I mean Betty Jo's shoulders!"
1,27,Betty Jo,Get off of me! I can't see!
1,27,Phineas,It's Grandma Betty! It's Hildegard! It's Betty! It's Hildegard! It's a tie!
1,27,Clyde,A tie? Ooh. Betty Jo ain't gonna like that.
1,27,Betty Jo,"Well, at least I won this race."
1,27,Hildegard,You won? You're crazy! I obviously crossed the finish line first!
1,27,Betty Jo,"Wrong! And, get off, cheater!"
1,27,Candace,"Hey, Grandma, that was really fun! I thought it'd be lame and I'd hate it, but, I had fun."
1,27,Betty Jo,"How about you, Hilda? Did you have fun?"
1,27,Hildegard,"Yeah, I did. Maybe it ain't so important who won but that we had fun with the kids."
1,27,Betty Jo,"Yea, maybe it ain't important. But just for the record, I won."
1,27,Hildegard,"You mean, even though you lost, it's having fun that's important."
1,27,Betty Jo,"Who are you calling an loser, cheater?"
1,27,Hildegard,"Who are you calling a cheater, loser?"
1,27,Betty Jo,That's it! Race ya to the Rutherford B. Hayes statue! Go!
1,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(He sighs) Perry the Platypus...my head is killing me. This is all a wash anyway. I'll turn on the ray and you'll turn off the ray, thwarting my plan. Let's just get it over with, all right? Ray on."
1,27,Doofenshmirtz,Ray off. Good.
1,27,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm just going to lie down for a bit. I promise I'll be more evil next time, alright?"
1,27,Candace,"All right, all right, we've had our kicks. But Mom's still gonna flip when she sees this. (A car door shuts) That's her car! You are so busted! (she skates into the house)"
1,27,Candace,"(coming out of the house) Mom, come on, come on! The boys built a giant roller rink in the backyard– uh...giant loaf of bread?"
1,27,Phineas,"(in the same intonation as ""I don't know"") Ah 'unno."
1,27,Candace,(skates back inside) Moooom Mom! The boys built a giant loaf of bread in the backyard!
1,27,Linda,(inside the house) What? I thought you said it was a roller rink.
1,27,Candace,"It was, but now it's a loaf of bread! (skates back out) Come on, come on! See?! (stops to see that the bread is gone)"
1,27,Linda,"(comes out with Lawrence) Candace, what are you talking about?!"
1,27,Candace,B-b-b...bread...
1,27,Linda,"(at Phineas and Ferb) Boys, I think she's finally lost it."
1,27,Phineas,"Hey, Dad. How'd your speech go?"
1,27,Lawrence,"Well, I have to say it was ""thimbly"" wonderful."
1,27,Phineas,"Hey, what's this thing do?"
1,27,Candace,Wha–? (Candace is launched off)
1,27,Jeremy,"Hey, guys. Candace around?"
1,27,Ferb,"Good catch, Jeremy."
1,27,Candace,(She giggles) He sure is.
1,27,(Song,"""Perry the Platypus"")"
1,33,Candace,"(On her cell phone, in her room) Oh, my gosh, Stacy! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Jeremy asked me if I could meet him at the fair later today next to the Ferris wheel. Oh, no! I almost forgot I'm scared of heights! What am I going to do?"
1,33,Linda,"(Calling from downstairs) Candace, we're leaving now!"
1,33,Candace,"Mom, I'm having a teenage crisis!"
1,33,Linda,Don't forget we're going bowling. We need you to keep an eye on the boys.
1,33,Lawrence,Preferably two.
1,33,Phineas,"Bowling? That sounds fun. Hey, Dad, is it alright if we use that old lawn-bowling set?"
1,33,Lawrence,"Sure thing, boys! Knock yourselves out."
1,33,Linda,Toodles!
1,33,Phineas,"You know, Ferb, with a few modifications, we could really zip up this old lawn-bowling set."
1,33,Baljeet,"Hello, Phineas. What'you doing? Ooh! I just sounded like Isabella."
1,33,Phineas,We're gonna build the world's biggest and best bowling-ball game!
1,33,Baljeet,"Well, according to The Most Pointless Book of World Records... (♪ Fanfare) ...the world's largest bowling ball is four feet in diameter."
1,33,Phineas,"Four feet? Ferb, we could beat that record in our sleep."
1,33,Baljeet,"You know, the officials from The Most Pointless Book of World Records... (♪ Fanfare) ...will be at the fair today at 3:00, handing out awards."
1,33,Phineas,"Ferb, get the tools. We've got a record to shatter."
1,33,Baljeet,And then you will be in the next volume! (♪ Fanfare) (to Buford) Is that absolutely necessary?
1,33,Buford,Why? Does it bug ya?
1,33,Baljeet,"Well, yes, a little."
1,33,Buford,"Then, yeah, it's necessary."
1,33,Baljeet,"All right. Fair enough. Hey, where is Perry?"
1,33,Carl,"Ooh, sorry about that, Agent P."
1,33,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. We've tracked Doofenshmirtz to an old abandoned warehouse, and he's made some suspicious purchases, 10,000 packets of powdered hot chocolate, a hotdog vendor's cart, a medium-sized parka, and a pair of red flannel long johns with a flap in the back. Don't ask us how we know. Get out there and kick some Doofen-butt."
1,33,Baljeet,Wow! That is one big bowling ball.
1,33,Phineas,"Hey, look at that, Ferb! Told you we could do it in our sleep."
1,33,Candace,"So, what do you think I should wear to the fair tonight? I'm thinking my favorite red blouse with my white skirt and red matching socks."
1,33,Candace,"Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back."
1,33,Phineas,That was amazing!
1,33,Isabella,"Wow, Phineas! Another strike!"
1,33,Phineas,"That makes four in a row! In your face, Buford!"
1,33,Baljeet,"Ha ha! Yes! What he said! In da face! (Laughs) Uh-uh, I mean... You will get him next time. Clearly."
1,33,Phineas,"Ferb, did you get that strike?"
1,33,Phineas,Who's next?
1,33,Candace,"Phineas, just what do you think you're doing out here?"
1,33,Phineas,"Candace, you're just in time. It's your turn."
1,33,Candace,"Just wait until Mom hears about... Then again, you guys always seem to make everything disappear before Mom gets home. But if I take the evidence to her at the Bowl-A-Rama, then she'll have to believe me!"
1,33,Linda,"Oh, Candace, you were right about Phineas and Ferb this whole time. We should've believed you."
1,33,Lawrence,"And just to express how sorry we are, here's my credit card. You have our permission to ruin us financially."
1,33,Jeremy,"Candace, that is so cool how you busted your brothers like that! Will you marry me?"
1,33,Phineas,"So, you wanna give it a try?"
1,33,Candace,"I do, Jeremy, I mean, uh... I'd love to give it a try!"
1,33,Phineas,All right. I'll show you how it works.
1,33,Phineas,"Well, first of all, the cockpit's on a gyroscope so it stays level. Here's your monitor, and this is the trackball you use to steer. Now, no matter what, never hit the gyro stabilizer lock button! It'll disable the gyroscope, and you'll spin around like a greased pig on roller skates."
1,33,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, use the trackball. Don't hit the button. I got it!"
1,33,Phineas,All right. You seem to know what you're doing.
1,33,Candace,"Do I ever? This is a piece of cake. Bowl-R-Ama, here I come!"
1,33,Phineas,"Okay, Candace, try to take it slow at first!"
1,33,Candace,(laughs hysterically as she controls the ball)
1,33,Phineas,"Way to go, Candace!"
1,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. Right on time. It seems like you've got quite a chill there! I want you to meet my latest creation: the Giant Robotic Penguin Icy-Freeze-Your-Socks-Off Breath-inator...thingy! First, I will unleash my giant penguins at the fair today, so they may begin freezing the entire city! Then I will sell all the citizens of Danville my organic, yet highly addictive, Doof brand hot chocolate. Because, you know, who doesn't enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate when it's so cold out? The first cup will be free, of course. But then the second...will also be free. But then the third...will cost a million dollars! That way, I only have to sell three, and I will already be a millionaire. So, Perry the Platypus, as they say in Mexico, dos svidanya! Down there, that's two vidanyas."
1,33,Phineas,She's headed for the Bowl-A-Rama!
1,33,Candace,(laughs hysterically)
1,33,Linda,"You know, dear, Candace hasn't called."
1,33,Lawrence,"Oh, don't worry. I'm sure the kids are having a ball."
1,33,Phineas,Ooh! That's gotta hurt.
1,33,Candace,"Oh, no!"
1,33,Phineas,So where does this lead?
1,33,Construction Worker,Huh. Heck if I know.
1,33,Phineas,"Ferb, the map of Danville's underground. (Ferb pulls out aforesaid map) Looks like she's headed downtown."
1,33,Candace,"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!"
1,33,Barry,"That's one big bowling ball, Bob."
1,33,Bob,"You betcha, Barry."
1,33,Phineas,Here she comes!
1,33,Buford/Baljeet,"Go, Candace!"
1,33,Buford,There she goes.
1,33,Phineas,"All right, guys! To Seventh Street!"
1,33,Baljeet,"Candace! You can do it! Go, Candace!"
1,33,Isabella,Go! Go! Go!
1,33,Phineas,"Hey, Baljeet, what's the world record for the largest pinball machine?"
1,33,Baljeet,"I am not sure, but I know we can beat it."
1,33,Phineas,"Okay, everybody, split up and let's keep her in play until we get to the fair."
1,33,(Song,"""Pin-bowlin'"")"
1,33,Candace,AAAAAAAAAH!
1,33,Candace,I'm out of control!
1,33,Phineas,Woo-hoo!
1,33,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAH! HELP!
1,33,Phineas,"Way to keep it goin', Ferb."
1,33,Man,"Oop, better luck next time, little man. (to Isabella) Isabella, darlin'!"
1,33,Isabella,"Set me up, Shady Joe. I'm feelin' lucky."
1,33,Shady Joe,Oh! That's my girl! You give it your best shot.
1,33,Shady Joe,"Help yourself, anything from the top shelf."
1,33,Announcer,"Welcome, Danvillians, to the World's Most Pointless Records Awards! Let's meet some of our record holders. Here we have Cletus with the world's hairiest pig. Next to him is Margaret with the world's stinkiest cheese. And finally, we got little Timmy holding the world's fattest gerbil. Let's have a big round of applause for the most pointless world-record winners!"
1,33,Phineas,Wait! We've got two more World's Most Pointless Records for our own!
1,33,Announcer,"Well, then, step right up, sonny, and tell everybody what they are."
1,33,Phineas,"Our first entry is for the world's largest bowling ball, and the other is for the world's largest game of pinball!"
1,33,Announcer,"Wow! Well, let's see 'em!"
1,33,Ferb,Wait for it.
1,33,Announcer,"Looks like we have two more World's Most Pointless Records! (Gasps) Wait, two records in one day? That's another world record!"
1,33,Doofenshmirtz,"To the fair, my pets, where the freezing of the Tri-State Area will begin! (Later notices the bowling ball) Wait. Wait, what is that? A giant bowling ball? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
1,33,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Eventually lands next to Jeremy on the Ferris wheel)
1,33,Jeremy,"Oh, Candace, you made it. I was thinking you weren't gonna show. Although, you know, usually we get on at the bottom."
1,33,Candace,(Giggles)
1,33,Phineas,"(On microphone) We'd especially like to thank our sister, Candace. We couldn't have done it without you, sis!"
1,33,Jeremy,"You know, your brothers are all right. Hey, are you okay? (Candace points to the ground) Oh, afraid of heights. Don't worry, I got ya."
1,33,Phineas,"How about you, Perry? Is there anything you'd like to add?"
1,33,Shady Joe,"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, step right up! It's only a dollar to see the mysterious Penguin-Man. Is he man? Is he penguin? Or perhaps some logic-defying amalgam of man and penguin? A manguin, if you will."
1,33,Doofenshmirtz,"I used to have goals. They were evil goals, but they were goals."
1,1,Phineas,"So, Ferb, what do you wanna do today?"
1,1,Phineas,"What about Perry, what does he want to do?"
1,1,Phineas,"Well, he's a platypus, they don't do much. I for one, am starting to get bored, and boredom is something of up with which I will not put! The first thing they're gonna ask us when we get back to school is ""what did we do over the summer?"". I mean, no school for three months. Our life should be a roller coaster! And I mean a good roller coaster, not like that one we rode at the state fair."
1,1,Fair Worker,Please exit to the left.
1,1,Phineas,"Man, that was lame. Why, if I built a roller coaster, I would... (Gets idea; angelic chorus plays) That's it! I know what we're gonna do today!"
1,1,Linda,"Phineas, Ferb. I'm gonna pick up a few things. You boys stays out of trouble, okay?"
1,1,Phineas,Okay mom. (At Ferb) We're gonna build a roller coaster!
1,1,Candace,"I'm in charge, right? You did tell them I'm in charge?"
1,1,Linda,"Relax, Candace, nobody has to be in charge."
1,1,Candace,But what if there's a emergency?
1,1,Linda,Like what?
1,1,Candace,What if a... What if a satellite falls out of orbit and crashes into the house? (smiles)
1,1,Linda,"If that happens, you're in charge."
1,1,Candace,Yes!
1,1,Candace,"(she enters into the backyard) Mom says I'm in charge, conditionally."
1,1,Phineas,Whatever.
1,1,Candace,"Wait a minute, what are you doing?"
1,1,Phineas,Homework.
1,1,Candace,It's summer.
1,1,Phineas,"That's cool, you wait till the last minute then."
1,1,Candace,"Well, I'm watching you. (Goes through the door) And I'm in charge, conditionally!"
1,1,Candace,"Hello? Oh, hi, Stacy! No, I can't get to the mall right now. Mom just went to the store, she left me in charge, well, you know, conditionally."
1,1,Candace,"And if you go, can you see if Jeremy is there? No, no, he's the cute one that works at Mr. Slushy Burger."
1,1,Candace,"Yeah, he totally smiled at me the last time I was there. I just about died. No, I told you I can't, I'm watching my brother and step-brother."
1,1,Candace,"Yeah, and they never get into trouble, 'cause Mom never catches them. One of these days though, I'm going to see that she catches them red handed."
1,1,Candace,"Will you hold it down, I am trying to use the phone! (at Stacy) Mom left me in charge, so there will be no shenanigans today. What are doing right now? Why do you ask? What do you mean you can see it from your house? See what?!"
1,1,Candace,"Phineas, what is this?!"
1,1,Phineas,Do you like it?
1,1,Candace,"Ooh, I'm gonna tell Mom, and when she sees what you're doing, you are going down. (runs off) Down! Down! Down! D-O-W-N, down!"
1,1,Phineas,We're gonna need a blowtorch and some more peanut butter.
1,1,Isabella,"Hey Candace, is Phineas... home?"
1,1,Candace,"Down, down, I say!"
1,1,Isabella,(hearts in eyes) Hey Phineas.
1,1,Phineas,Hey Isabella.
1,1,Isabella,Whatcha doin'?
1,1,Phineas,Building a roller coaster.
1,1,Isabella,In your backyard?
1,1,Phineas,Some of it.
1,1,Isabella,Wow. Isn't that kind of impossible?
1,1,Phineas,Some might say.
1,1,Isabella,"Hey, Ferb."
1,1,Isabella,Does your step-brother ever talk?
1,1,Phineas,Ferb? He's more of a man of action.
1,1,Isabella,"I was gonna go to the pool, you wanna go swimming?"
1,1,Phineas,Kind of in the middle of something here.
1,1,Isabella,"Oh, right. Okay, I'll see you later then. (leaves)"
1,1,Phineas,Okay. (at Ferb) Hey Ferb! You got enough rivets up there?
1,1,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
1,1,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us, he bought up 80% of the country's tin foil. I want you to get over to his hideout right away. Find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. As always Agent P, it is important that your cover identity as a mindless domestic pet remains intact. Now, get out there. We're all counting on you."
1,1,Phineas,"So, the way I see it, the fuel rockets kick in at the mall's parking lot, then we release the snakes during the corkscrew at the interstate. I'm gonna go get the snakes."
1,1,Candace,"Mom! You gotta come home, right now."
1,1,Linda,Did a satellite crash into the house?
1,1,Candace,"No, no, no. You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing."
1,1,Linda,Seems like we've had this conversation before.
1,1,Candace,What do you mean?
1,1,Linda,"I seem to recall you telling me that the boys were training monkeys to juggle bicycles, and when I come home, there was a stunning lack of monkeys."
1,1,Candace,I still don't know how they cleaned that up so fast.
1,1,Linda,"So, what's the emergency this time?"
1,1,Candace,They're building a roller coaster!
1,1,Linda,"Candace, seriously, isn't Phineas a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?"
1,1,Factory Manager,Aren't you a little young to be a roller coaster engineer?
1,1,Phineas,"Yes, yes I am."
1,1,Factory Manager,"Well, I must say, I'm very impressed, the forms all seems to be in order, although I'd never seen them filled out in crayon before. So, if there's anything I can get you, anything at all, just let me know."
1,1,Phineas,Do you think we could borrow one of those gadgets?
1,1,Phineas,"Now, this is the life."
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, what an unexpected surprise. And by unexpected, I mean: completely expected!"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"I, Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil, and when I put my giant magnet, next to my genius, Magnetism Magnifier, I will pull the East, in westerly direction, thereby reversing the rotation of the earth. You may ask yourself, why would he do this? What could he possibly have to gain? Well, let me just answer that question, I haven't really worked on all the bugs yet. I mean, tin foil alone costs a lot."
1,1,Candace,"But Mom, I'd tell you, they're building  it, and it's huge!"
1,1,Candace,"""Phineas and Ferb present the Coolest Coaster Ever now open""? Mom! (runs off)"
1,1,Pedro,Phineas and Ferb got a roller coaster? You think we get a discount if we bring the flier?
1,1,Another kid,Maybe we better take it.
1,1,Candace,"(Gestures toward the empty post, head turned away) There, look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy, I told you!"
1,1,Linda,(dryly) And you're not crazy because...?
1,1,Linda,"I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be at the dairy section if you wanna come yell at some cheese, or anything. (leaves)"
1,1,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages! May I present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making: The Coolest...Coaster...Ever!!!"
1,1,Phineas,"So, who wants to go first?"
1,1,Phineas,"To fasten, insert the tab into the metal buckle. To release, just pull back on the -- oops."
1,1,Phineas,"Well, you get the picture. Well, that's about it, enjoy the ride."
1,1,Phineas,"You guys all signed the waivers, right?"
1,1,Phineas,"Relax, they're just rubber!"
1,1,Phineas,"Hey, look, there comes the AH-AH-AH-AH!"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"...I really make of my money back, I-I-I want a really spacey real estate, and sell it again."
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha, you missed!"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Aaaoow!! Ow, Ow, Ow, Aaooww!"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Now you are too late. Quake in your boots and watch helplessly, as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces, pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing the rotation of the--"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,Well...that didn't work.
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, we have a two ton ball of tin foil traveling 200 miles per hour directly at us! Quickly, we must separate the magnet from the Magnifier before it's too late!"
1,1,Linda,"Now I know I have that club card in here somewhere. I always have it with me, but my purse is a disaster area, you know how it is."
1,1,Candace,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom? Mom!? (She rushes off.)"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"It's no use, it's no use, we are doomed!"
1,1,Doofenshmirtz,"You did it! You saved us, Perry the Platypus! (The ball of tin foil crashes through the building.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
1,1,Candace,"Look, look, look, see?"
1,1,Linda,"(pause) Okay, I give up, what am I supposed to be looking at?"
1,1,Candace,(turns to see the empty parking lot) No!! It's not POSSIBLE!!!
1,1,Linda,(going back inside) I'm gonna go get the cart.
1,1,Candace,IT WAS RIGHT HERE AND IT WAS HUGE!!! (sees the rollercoaster fly away) Mom!
1,1,Linda,"(walks past, taking her cart) Time to go. I've got frozens."
1,1,Candace,"Okay, so you think that Phineas and Ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right?"
1,1,Linda,"Well, yes, that would be my guess."
1,1,Candace,"Fine, then lets go home. Now! (She pushes her.)"
1,1,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
1,1,Phineas,"Nice hat, Isabella."
1,1,Phineas,"Funny, I don't remember this in the blueprints."
1,1,Phineas,And I'm sure this is new.
1,1,Candace,Hehehehehehehehehehe!
1,1,Linda,"I worry about you sometimes, Candace."
1,1,Employee,"Welcome to Mr. Slushy Burger, may I take your order?"
1,1,Phineas,Anyone want fries?

1,1,Candace,"Yes. (At Linda) See Mom, I told you they weren't there!"
1,1,Linda,"Oh, hi boys."

1,1,Pedro,Way too cool.
1,1,Third kid,That was awesome! Can we do it again?
1,1,Phineas,"Sorry, only one ride per customer."
1,1,Isabella,"That was great, Phineas. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow?"
1,1,Phineas,Don't know yet.
1,1,Isabella,(pets Perry) Maybe you could teach Perry some tricks.
1,1,Phineas,"Well, he is a platypus, they don't do much."
1,1,Ferb,They're the only mammals to lay eggs.
1,1,Phineas,...Maybe he'll lay an egg.
1,1,Isabella,"Cool, see you tomorrow. (goes to the gate) It really was the coolest coaster ever. You guys makes a great team."
1,1,Phineas,"Well, a brother is a brother, but I couldn't have asked for a better one than Ferb. You know what I mean?"
1,1,Phineas,"Oh-ho-ho, man! I could smell the peanut butter!"
1,1,Isabella,"Well, that was impressive. See you, guys. (leaves)"
1,1,Phineas,"So, what should we do tomorrow? There's a world of possibilities. (pause) Maybe we should make a list!"

1,32,Candace,But...
1,32,Phineas,"It's true. We were up there! Ferb did the whole ""one giant step"" thing. Check out this moon stuff we brought back!"
1,32,Candace,Hmm?
1,32,Lawrence,Oh. You boys are so adorable.
1,32,Candace,Ah! You don't believe it. I'm so over this.
1,32,Linda,"Oh Candace, revel in your brothers' imagination. Makes life so much more fun."
1,32,Phineas,(Yawns) Pushing the boundaries of time and space sure makes a guy tired.
1,32,Linda,See? How fun is that?
1,32,Lawrence,"Night, boys."

1,32,Candace,"(Mimics) ""See? How fun is that?"" If only they'd believe me..."
1,32,Lawrence,"Look at this. I got a traffic ticket from that camera they installed across the street. Oh, that blasted device picks up everything on the block 24 hours a day."
1,32,Linda,Doesn't it run out of tape?
1,32,Lawrence,"Oh, no. It's on a compressed CD thingamabob. It can store months of digital video."
1,32,Candace,Video.
1,32,Linda,"Hon, you know we drive on the right."
1,32,Lawrence,"Yes, yes, so you keep telling me."
1,32,Candace,Gotcha!
1,32,Major Monogram,"Excellent trick, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but we are about to give you the most important mission of your career. Our computer indicates that a city security camera located near your civilian hideout has recorded your comings and goings as a secret agent. It's crucial to the agency's security that you get those recordings and bring them back to HQ for special disposal."

1,32,Phineas,"Candace, you okay? Your muffled emotion woke us up. What'cha watchin'?"
1,32,Candace,"Oh, just a little summer mini-series called... ""Evidence""!"
1,32,Phineas,"Oh, cool, our moon elevator! Mom would love this! I wonder if she's still up, let's show her!"
1,32,Candace,"Yes! Let's show Mom. (to Perry) Oh, Perry, Perry, Perry. I will remember this night always. Just think: on this very computer are the deliciously incriminating images from that CD I borrowed that will finally bust my brothers! (Laughs maniacally)"
1,32,Linda,"All right Candace, what's going on in there?"
1,32,Candace,"Mom, I finally got the evidence that'll prove that..."
1,32,Linda,Oh! Not this again! Show me in the morning.
1,32,Phineas,How's 7:00 sound?
1,32,Linda,"And you, too! Outta here!"
1,32,Phineas,We're gonna pencil her in for 7:30.

1,32,Norm,Hi. I'm Norm.
1,32,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Ferb wants to get started on the multimedia presentation for Mom. Can we borrow the CD? (Tries grab the disk but Candace slaps his hand)"
1,32,Candace,"No way, Phineas. There's no way I'm lettin' this baby out of my sight. This is the single greatest moment in my life, and there is nothing you little creeps can do to take it away from me."
1,32,Norm,"Hello, children. I'll take that. My name is Norm."
1,32,Candace,What was...that?
1,32,Phineas,"I don't know, but it was cool."
1,32,Linda,Keep it down!
1,32,Candace,So...you guys didn't make that?
1,32,Phineas,"No, but I want one."
1,32,Candace,But that thing ran off with my disk! My evidence!
1,32,Phineas,"Don't worry, Candace. We'll help you get it back."
1,32,Candace,You guys would help me bust you?
1,32,Phineas,"Sure, if it'll make ya happy. Plus, battling a giant robot, how cool is that?"
1,32,Candace,Excellent!

1,32,Major Monogram,Any word from Agent P?
1,32,Carl,"No, sir."
1,32,Major Monogram,So I guess all we can do is wait.
1,32,Carl,"And hope, sir."
1,32,Major Monogram,And hope.
1,32,Carl,And also wait.
1,32,Major Monogram,"I already did ""wait,"" Carl."
1,32,Carl,"Did we do ""hope""?"
1,32,Major Monogram,Ugh. I didn't become a major so I could sweat out a vaudeville routine with an intern.

Before you go, I'd like to introduce you to the Gloominator 3000... inator! (rattle) Hmm? What's that? Could it be Morse code for ""That evil gadget looks so manly and threatening. What on Earth does it do?"" All right, I'll tell you. Sheesh! Stop bugging me! With this, I will launch thousands of weather pellets into the atmosphere, thereby plunging the Tri-State Area into a new ice age! (dramatic music) But before I do that, I shall finally make Perry the Platypus disappear! Voila! Ha-ha. It really worked! Maybe I should have stuck with the magic business, hmm?"
1,26,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, wanna join our maiden voyage?"
1,26,Candace,I'm not gonna be a guinea pig for one of your harebrained...
1,26,Lulu,"Candace, wait! (She places a bike helmet with a camera on Candace's head.) We need you to get on that ride with this secret hidden camera. Now go get that footage and leave the busting to us!"
1,26,Phineas,"Everybody ready? Make sure your life vests are securely fastened. In case we capsize, your seat cushions can function as a headstone. (removes Candace’s helmet) Oh, you don't want to get this wet."
1,26,Candace,But-But-But-But –
1,26,Phineas,"Come on, Candace, that wasn't too bad, was it?"
1,26,Candace,"Actually, that was kinda..."
1,26,Candace,"That's it. It's over, right?"
1,26,(Song,"""Gotta Make Summer Last"")"
1,26,Candace,Aah!
1,26,Phineas,You wanna go again?
1,26,Candace,Are you crazy?!
1,26,Lulu,"Oh, she'd love to! Ha-ha. (at Candace) We need that footage if you wanna bust 'em. (She gives her a cowboy hat with a camera sticking out of it.) We disguised the camera this time. Don't lose it."
1,26,All,Whoa!
1,26,Doofenshmirtz,Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Now let's test my Gloominator 3000-inator! A couple of these ought to be enough. Let's see. Whoo-hoo! Look at them go! .... Perfect! Now for the real thing. .... Hmm. Maybe I can squeeze a few more in there. Lemme see. Perry the Platypus? Bobo the rabbit! Do you know that I've been looking for you since the seventh grade? (top hat cocking) Aah!
1,26,Farmer's Wife,I can't believe you spent our entire life savings on a bunny farm and forgot to buy any bunnies!
1,26,Farmer,"But, dear, I..."
1,26,Farmer’s Wife,"I mean, what did ya think - rabbits were just gonna fall outta the sky?"
1,26,Farmer,Looks like somebody owes me an apology.
1,26,Farmer's Wife,Touché.
1,26,Candace,"So, Lulu, did we get enough footage?"
1,26,Lulu,"Did we ever! (Brief shot of the TV monitors showing the footage.) Now we need you to call your mom for the big confrontation scene, and I'll call the station manager."
1,26,Candace,"Hi, Mom."
1,26,Linda,"Hi, Candace. What took you so long?"
1,26,Candace,"Just get over here as soon as you can. This time, it's gonna be different."
1,26,Lulu,"Sir, you should come over here right away. This will be our best show ever, I guarantee it!"
1,26,Kid 1,"Hey, that evil scientist just stole my bike!"
1,26,Kid 2,"Hey, that nice duck just gave me 20 bucks for my skateboard."
1,26,Lulu,Ooh! This is great! I can smell that second season pickup. .... What was that?
1,26,Candace,(gasps) My mom is here.
1,26,Lulu,My station manager is here.
1,26,Linda,"Candace, what's going on? Who are these people? Could you please..."
1,26,Candace,"Mom, Mom, we're gonna be on TV. I can finally prove everything."
1,26,Lulu,"I'm talking about ratings dynamite here, sir. (With her eyes closed) Tell me that's not ratings dynamite!"
1,26,Station Manager,"That's not ratings dynamite, that's a suburban backyard."
1,26,Lulu,(sputtering) But I had no idea... What? I don't understand... What?! Where is everything?!!
1,26,Candace,Welcome to my world.
1,26,Lulu,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! The video tapes! All the proof is still in the van! Come on, gimme a ""bust 'em""!"
1,26,Both,(Fist bumping in time) Bust 'em! Bust 'em! Bust 'em!
1,26,Station Manager,You get that a lot?
1,26,Linda,Pretty much every day around here.
1,26,Lulu,"It’s in the van, it's in the van, it's in the van, it's in the van!"
1,26,Station Manager,I don't think I can take this everyday.
1,26,Linda,You get used to it.
1,26,Lulu,The van... (Reveal the van is gone.) Where is the vaaaaaan?!
1,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! So nice of them to leave the keys inside.... That's what you get for being the good guy. You have to stop at all the traffic signals. (laughs) Uh... Oh, no! What.... What is this? Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
1,26,Linda,"So, kids. Keeping cool today?"
1,26,Candace,"""Hi, Mom."""

1,26,Phineas,"Oh, there you, Perry."
1,26,Candace,And Ferb says...
1,26,Ferb,And that's why I never wear suspenders in public.
1,26,Candace,"""Now for some snacks."""
1,26,Linda,Why do you kids come inside for some pie?
1,26,Candace,"Yeah, I'll take some pie."
1,26,Candace,Now you can understand my pain. Want some pie?
1,26,Doofenshmirtz,I'm getting dizzy! Oh! Maybe I'm supposed to turn into a skid. Whoa!
1,26,Farmer's Wife,I can't believe you sold our lucrative bunny farm and bought a van rental place! And you didn't buy a single van! (Hears the van falling over her) Not one word.
1,30,Phineas,"How's the view up there, Ferb?(Ferb gives a thumbs up)"
1,30,Phineas,"This is the life. The sand, the sea, the sun."
1,30,Buford,(Sobbing)
1,30,Phineas,"The crying? Hey, what's wrong, Buford? Why are you crying?"
1,30,Buford,"First, let's get one thing straight: I'm not crying. I'm just sweating through my eyes. And second...I lost Biff! (Sobbing)"
1,30,Phineas,You mean your goldfish?
1,30,Buford,"Yes! (Sobbing) He changed my life, you know. I used to be a wimp, just like you. But then, one day, at the carnival, I was somehow drawn to this game."
1,30,Young Buford,"(Hammers, Ding)"
1,30,Buford,"And that's how I won my goldfish. I named it Biff, after my mother. It was the happiest day of my life. But then I met the local bully."
1,30,Bully,"Hello, nerd! Well, well, what do we have here? Looks like you brought me lunch! (Puts Biff over his mouth) (Laughs)"
1,30,Buford,"I knew I had to defend my friend, so I did what I had to do."
1,30,Flashback Buford,No! NO!!
1,30,Buford,(Sobbing hysterically)
1,30,Phineas,Wow. This was more annoying than when he was bullying us. We gotta do something to get the old Buford back. Maybe we should help him find his fish.
1,30,Buford,Really? You guys would do that? How about a hug?
1,30,Phineas,Maybe later.
1,30,Buford,Let Buford hug you.
1,30,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
1,30,Buford,Come here!
1,30,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. We've intercepted some very surprising footage from a local TV station. (Plays video)"
1,30,Reporter,Breaking news: A kitten in peril! Up a tree! (Cat falls) Oh no!
1,30,Major Monogram,(Stops video) You see that? Dr. Doofenshmirtz saving a kitten. Looks like he's defecting to the good side! Make contact and present him with our standard welcome package. Monogram out.
1,30,Candace,"(Puts on glasses shaped like the sun) How about these? Do you think Jeremy would like them? (Gasps) Ooh, these are even better!"
1,30,Stacy,"Hey, Candace, look, is that a submarine? (Helicopter whirring) And aren't those your brothers?"
1,30,Phineas,I can't believe how fast we put this together.
1,30,Ferb,Yes. Usually takes us at least a montage.
1,30,Candace,"(Wearing fish glasses) They're not getting away with this. I know what I'm getting. I'm gonna get this disposable camera, and then I'll finally have proof, and I can bust them!"
1,30,Store Owner,"Hey, you gotta pay for that!"
1,30,Candace,Right after I pay for this.
1,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello? Oh, Perry the Platypus. What do you want? Oh, a gift for me? (Unhooks chain lock) Oh, how sweet of you! Oh, what's this note attached? ""Congratulations, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, on defecting to the good side""? Oh no, not you, too! The TV's been repeating that news footage all day! First, I'm not going to the good side. Second, I'm going to keep this basket. There's a lot of goodies here. Third, let me tell you what really happened."
1,30,Phineas,"All right, Isabella. Now it's your turn, Baljeet."
1,30,Buford,(Sobbing)
1,30,Baljeet,Why is Buford crying?
1,30,Buford,I'm not cryin'! I'm sweatin' through my eyes! (Sobbing)
1,30,Phineas,"All right, Buford. You're next."
1,30,Buford,That doesn't look very safe. (Goes in)
1,30,Phineas,You're doing fine.
1,30,Buford,"Hey, I'm stuck! I'm stuck! (Sobbing)"
1,30,Isabella,"Hey, Buford, are you...sweating out of your eyes?"
1,30,Buford,"(pause) No, I'm just cryiiiiiing! (Sobbing) (Ferb lands on him) Thanks. I needed that."
1,30,Isabella,"Ready when you are, Captain."
1,30,Phineas,We're ready to go. How's Buford?
1,30,Buford,"Buford is doing great! I just hope we'll be able to find my friend Biff. (Points at bowl, Sobbing)"
1,30,Phineas,Don't worry. Ferb can communicate with dolphins. (Dolphins chirping) They'll help us find your goldfish.
1,30,Buford,"(Gasps) Biff! He looks so sweet! (Sobbing, Puts picture in fish bowl) How about a hug? (Ferb puts hand up) Come on!"
1,30,Phineas,"All right, everyone, the dolphins are leading the way."

1,30,Doofenshmirtz,"So, Perry the Platypus, allow me to introduce the Media Erase-inator! Patent pending, Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. It will erase all video signals, print ads, basically it will erase any image in the entire Tri-State Area! And I will be able to attend my reunion without any embarrassment."

1,30,Phineas,It sure looks like it.
1,30,Buford,"(Puts fishbowl through Biff) There you go, little buddy. You're all safe now. Let's get out of here."
1,30,Phineas,Maybe later.
1,30,Buford,"I'm so happy, I could cry! (Sobbing)"
1,30,Phineas,"I wish we'd get our Buford back. Uh, Buford?"
1,30,Buford,(Screams)

1,30,Phineas,Hmm. A giant squid. What are the odds?
1,30,Baljeet,My money is on the squid.
1,30,Isabella,"Cut me off a slice of that action,"
1,30,Buford,"Hey, squid! (Jumps off) Drop the goldfish! You and me are gonna dance!"
1,30,Phineas,"So, I guess that's that."
1,30,Baljeet,I do not know how he does it.
1,30,Isabella,"Always go for the long shots, kid."
1,30,Phineas,"Good day for Buford, huh? He got Biff back, and I don't think he's afraid of squids anymore."
1,30,Buford,"Alright, there's nothing to see here. Everybody back inside."
1,30,Candace,That was amazing! I can't believe I got all of this on film.
1,30,Buford,(Goes into submarine)
1,30,Phineas,"Hey, Buford, you were really brave out there."
1,30,Buford,What's that supposed to mean? (Grabs Phineas) You think I was a wimp before?
1,30,Baljeet,"N-no, not really. But you were a lot more sensitive."
1,30,Buford,"What did you say? (Drops Phineas, Does the Wet Willie on Baljeet)"
1,30,Phineas,"Yeah, Buford is back!"
1,30,Candace,"(Come out of submarine) What? I've got to save the camera! Save the camera, save the camera, save the camera!"
1,30,Baljeet,Yay! We are back! We made it! (Falls back)
1,30,Buford,I told ya I was comin' out first! Biff and I have some catchin' up to do.

1,24,Phineas,"No, the Badbeard part."
1,24,Grandpa Clyde,"Oh, right. It was named after Badbeard, the most ruthless freshwater pirate ever to plunder a lakeside community."
1,24,Kids,Cool!
1,24,Grandpa Clyde,"And in the middle of Badbeard Lake lies Spleen Island, where legend has it Badbeard buried his bountiful booty. Heh!"

1,18,Phineas,We're racing our remote-controlled monster trucks. (Remotes clicking)
1,18,Linda,I don't see any monster trucks.
1,18,Phineas,"Oh, that's 'cause we rigged them to go light-speed. You how those stock motors are. They never give you enough action."
1,18,Linda,(oblivious) You boys have such active imaginations. You must get it from your father.
1,18,Lawrence,Let's see... Green goes to number 5. (Laughs) I'm painting!

1,18,Phineas,"Bye, Mom. (At Ferb) Final lap, Ferb. (Cars zooming) Aw! Another photo finish. I'm never watching closely enough to see who won."
1,18,Candace,Despair speaking.
1,18,Stacy,"Care to explain why ""Despair"" isn't picking up her cell phone this morning?"
1,18,Candace,"Because of a little thing called PARALLEL PARKING! You see yesterday, Dad was teaching me how to drive..."
1,18,Lawrence,"Okay, Candace. All you have to do is park between this plastic trash can, and that plastic trash can."
1,18,Candace,So I put it in reverse... AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! (drives back and forth slamming into the two trash cans)
1,18,Phineas,"Oh my gosh, Ferb. I can't believe it! I've never noticed how soft our carpets are. But more importantly, we have to help Candace get her confidence back. Any ideas?"
1,18,Phineas,"This is perfect! The Candace Crusher! Nothing says confidence like a monster truck. Hey, where's Perry?"
1,18,Major Monogram,"Oh, hey Agent P. So, get this: I got this memo this morning on Doofenshmirtz. And somebody abbreviated his name and it- guess how they wrote it. (Pauses) Doof! (Laughs) The Doof! (Laughs again) It's times like these when you really appreciate having a cool name like Monogram."

1,18,Lawrence,"Oh, oh, yeah, thanks. (Notices the monster truck) CRIKEY! A monster truck!"
1,18,Phineas,"Yeah! Isn't it sweet? It's to help to teach Candace how to parallel park and stuff. We figured out if she learned how to drive on of these monsters, she's got the confidence to drive anything."
1,18,Lawrence,"Oh yeah, brilliant. But I better check with Mom about this. (At phone) Uh, hello honey, yes, yes, oh gosh, I love you too, darling. Uh, are you aware the boys have a monster truck in the backyard?"
1,18,Linda,"Honestly, you're as bad as Candace."

1,18,Candace,"Oh, this seems like a good idea."
1,18,Phineas,I gotcha.
1,18,Candace,"Oh, what's the point? I'm never gonna be able to parallel park."
1,18,Phineas,"Don't worry, sis. It's just to build your confidence."
1,18,Lawrence,"Okay, don't forget to buckle up."
1,18,Candace,But we can't drive here. It's just the backyard.
1,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Gentlemen, I have a unique investment opportunity for you. I'm sure you're all aware of the popularity of monster trucks, right? But you know, they are not really monsters, just big, stupid trucks! So, I came up with my own line of monster trucks! Behold!"
1,18,"Very evil, don't you think? And there's even one that looks like me! Look, look! (Laughs) We'll corner the markets! And just to be sure, I have created","The Monster Truck Away-inator! (Dramatic music) You know, to do away with the competition."
1,18,Evil Investor,But is it safe to use?

1,18,Evil Investor,(Head swelling up)
1,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Except maybe a little swelling, but don't worry, it will go down. You know, probably. Now, watch what it does to this miniature monster truck! (Fires laser; Evil Investors talking at once) I don't know where it sends them, maybe another dimension."
1,18,Alien,(Eats the miniature truck)
1,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Of course, that was just a toy. Let's try it out on a real monster truck. Huh? Which brings me to my next invention. The Monster Truck Locate-Inator! (At Perry) Perry the Platypus? Guess what? That's not a monster truck locate-inator at all! It's a Chinese platypus trap! (Laughs) I got you. Here's the real Locate-inator! Okay, now, where is the nearest monster truck? Yes! Right here in Danville! Okay, everybody, get in me and we'll go."
1,18,Evil Investor,Are you sure you want to bring him?
1,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Well, yes, of course. He's my nemesis. I have to show him everything."

1,18,Candace,Oh. So I put it into drive... AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH!
1,18,Phineas,"I don't think we're gonna get a deposit back on those cones. Okay, Candace. All you have to do on this test is go up this gentle incline."
1,18,Candace,"Dad, you look nervous."
1,18,Lawrence,"No, of course not. I- I have full confidence in you."
1,18,Candace,"Phineas, this incline is getting kind of steep!"

1,2,Phineas,Sure.
1,2,Candace,"I mean, I've been a friend of Suzy's longer than Katie, so I should've been invited to that party first. I don't care if they're lab partners! We're locker neighbors. And locker neighbors trumps lab partners any day. (Gasps) Sorry Stacy. Gotta go."
1,2,Phineas,Welcome to our beach.
1,2,Candace,"Hah! You call that a beach? This is WAY below your usual standard. This isn't even worth a call to mom. You know, if you guys ever want to be popular, you're gonna have to stop playing in sandboxes. (Gets hit by a beach ball) Hey!"

Here's the scores from our judges. And Buford doesn't like it one bit. (Buford smashes the table with Bobby) Next up is Phineas Flynn, and it's great to see a young surfer show such confidence. Uh-oh, what's this? (Buford splashes through the holographic Phineas) Oh, those kids today and their holographic projections. He's in the pipeline, now he's hangin' ten! He's hanging twenty! He's hangin' thirty-two! Now he's just hangin'! The crowd loves it! I don't think there's a name for that! The crowd is doing the wave, and Phineas is surfing it! Let's go to the judges.10 to the 5th power, infinity, and oh! It seems Phineas Flynn's radical surfing has made judge #3 re-think Einstein's theory of relativity! Cowabunga, laws of nature!"

1,2,Candace,"(Sighs, talking fast) Phineas and Ferb built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to. But instead of just a cute little beach in a sandbox; it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline, and palm trees, and a pier, and hula dancers, and water skiers, and tiki huts, and dolphins, and dancing, and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up-"
1,2,Doofenshmirtz,Oof!
1,2,Candace,"...and then I was just about to share a smoothie with Jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head, and ...and just for a moment, it seemed that the wily Buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes...then I can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom!

This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like. And this is Asparagus, the greatest warrior in all of Greece. With this golden chariot, he would win every race. And here he is defeating the Minotaur, a creature that's half-man, half-bull. Asparagus defeated him using the head of Medusa, a creature so ugly she could turn people to stone with just one look."

1,25,Isabella,(runs back) Wait! At what time?
1,25,Phineas,In about an hour or so.

1,25,Male teen,I bought a ticket to see this movie.
1,25,Doofenshmirtz,"(Groans) Okay, just roll the film."
1,25,Male narrator,"Who is the enemy of the platypuses? Or platypi or platypeople? Or... Well, you know what I mean. The platypus is one of our greatest friends in nature, a humble but key component in Mother Nature's delicate cycle of life. But as of late, worldwide populations have been declining to near endangerment. But why? Who is the enemy of the platypuses or... Well, you know what I mean."
1,25,Male teen,This is the best platypus movie I have ever seen.
1,25,Male narrator,"Historically, the enemies of the platypus were well known: the poisonous swamp viper, the snaggle-tooth badger, and duplicating imitable stunts seen on television. But there is a new enemy of the platypus, one whose tireless development paves over the platypus's woodland homes: The greatest enemy of the platypus...is man."
1,25,Cheerful male voice,"Hi, there."
1,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, you see, Perry the Platypus? For years I've been trying to rid myself of you with traps and bombs and poisonous gas and automatic tennis ball machines. I--I don't even know what I was thinking back then, but now I have the ultimate platypus elimination weapon. Perry the Platypus, recoil in horror at my new creation! A giant...killer...robot...man."
1,25,Giant Robot Man,My name is Norm. The enemy of the platypus is man.
1,25,Doofenshmirtz,Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!
1,25,Male teen,This is awesome! I did not know this movie was in 3-D.
1,25,Norm,"Please, stop running. Perhaps we could discuss our differences over coffee."
1,25,Phineas,"Okay, we're all set! Let's meet our racers. In the first chariot is us. Then we got Isabella and the Fireside Girls, Buford and Baljeet, and we have one for Candace, too, if she ever shows up. Here are the maps for everyone. The first chariot to reach the museum wins. Any questions?"
1,25,Baljeet,Yes. Should we not establish the rules first?
1,25,Buford,This is a chariot race. There are no rules.
1,25,Isabella,"No rules? Well, if those are the rules!"
1,25,Buford,"Hey, you, you're goin' down!"
1,25,Baljeet,But we're on the same team.
1,25,Buford,Then you're goin' down with me!

1,31,Phineas,"Hey, I know what we should do today. Grandpa Fletcher, let's have a medieval tournament just like the knights did in the days of yore. We can he jousting and catapults and not bathe."

1,31,Candace,"Uh, Stacy, I'll call you back."
1,31,Stubbings,"I believe it's my serve. Oh, dear. I have punned."
1,31,Phineas,"(Dressed as a fool) Back it up! Back it up! (Trucks beep) Good. Right there. Lumber over here, suckling pigs over there. Hold it! That pig's barely suckling. What do I look like, a fool? (The man carrying the pig shoves an apple into the pig's mouth) That's what I'm talking about. Carry on. (To Ferb) So, you ready to chop some lumber, Ferb? (Ferb salutes) Hey, where's Perry?"
1,31,Major Monogram,"Ahh, Agent P. Sorry about the tight squeeze, but they're on the metric system. Doofenshmirtz is attending an evil scientists' convention in London. We're sending you in undercover, disguised as evil scientist Dr. Lloyd Wexler who, incidentally, is the man sitting next to you. Good luck, Agent P."
1,31,Candace,Phineas?
1,31,Phineas,"Oh, hi, Candace."
1,31,Candace,What do you think you're doing?
1,31,Phineas,I think I'm building a horse.
1,31,Candace,"There's a cute boy next door, and I don't want you guys scaring him off by acting like complete freaks."
1,31,Charles,Beg pardon?
1,31,Candace,Hello. (Giggles)
1,31,Charles,I'm Charles Pipping the fourth.
1,31,Candace,I'm Candace Flynn... the First.
1,31,Charles,"So, what's all this?"
1,31,Candace,This? Uh... This is just a--
1,31,Phineas,We're putting on a medieval tournament.
1,31,Candace,"Medieval tournament? That has to be, without a doubt, the most--"
1,31,Charles,Brilliant idea I've heard in years!
1,31,Candace,Exactly. (Laughs) Because who doesn't love whatever happens at one of those... Those... Things?
1,31,Phineas,Wanna join us?
1,31,Charles,"Absolutely. We could use my family's castle as a backdrop. And you can be the fair princess in the tower, waiting to be rescued by a handsome knight."
1,31,Candace,(she blinks twice) Okay!
1,31,Man #1,"Welcome to Evil-Con, Dr. Lloyd Wexler. Hey! Wait a second. (Moves ID card to reveal Perry disguised as Dr. Wexler) You didn't get your evil button. Enjoy the convention, Dr. Wexler."
1,31,Candace,"(With a fake British accent) As the fair princess in the tower, I declare Sir Charles the winner of the tournament... (Thinks using her normal voice) Wait a second. Could this be one of those things that backfires horribly on me? (Pauses) Nah."
1,31,Charles,Looks like that armor is big enough for the two of you.
1,31,Phineas,"That's a great idea. (To Ferb) Ferb, I'll take the top half because I tend to do more of the talking, and you take the bottom half because of your incredibly long, willowy legs."
1,31,Candace,"Yoo-hoo! Sir Charles! They can't even hear me up here. (She yells) Yo, Chuck! (Growls) What is going on down there? (She attempts to open the door, but only manages to pull the handle off) Oh, come on! Hey, guys! I am locked in the tower!"
1,31,Phineas,"That's the spirit, Candace! You sound like a real damsel in distress!"
1,31,Candace,"(She growls) I have got to get out of here. (She tries to grab a spear from a knights grip) Let go! Come on, let go! Fine! Have it your way. (She picks up the armor, and smashes through the door. However, soon after the armor becomes undone, and Candace lands in it, making her look like the Black Knight)"
1,31,Charles,"Well, then, since you chaps are just about put together, I think it's time I popped next door to fetch my own armor."
1,31,Phineas,"There's something almost disturbing about this. Hey, look. he's back."
1,31,Candace,(Grunts)
1,31,Phineas,"Okay, Charles, we'll help you get on your horse and do a practice run."
1,31,Candace,(Muffled scream)
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"You didn't think I'd recognize you, did you? But I do! You’re Dr. Lloyd Wexler, my greatest hero in all of evil science. Oh, I can't believe I'm actually talking to you! You know, I wrote my thesis on one of your early ransom notes. Gee, you wouldn't mind if I just hung around with you today, would you?"
1,31,Perry,(He blinks twice)
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,"Lords and ladies of the court, I declare that this contest is to begin!"
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,Are you boys ready over there?
1,31,Phineas,"Ready, Ferb?"
1,31,Phineas,"We're ready, Grandpa!"
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,"How about you, Charles?"
1,31,Candace,(Muffled screaming)
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,That's the spirit.
1,31,Phineas,"Look, our catapult works."
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,"Way to hang in there, Charles."
1,31,Phineas,"Guess we won, Ferb. Yeah!"
1,31,Charles,"What ho, chaps. Still up for a bit of a joust?"
1,31,Stubbings,"Your lance, sir."
1,31,Phineas,Charles? Then who's that?
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,Perhaps it was the ghost of the Black Knight. But I wonder where his Hounds of Heck are.
1,31,Man #2,(Upon seeing this) It's the ghost of the Black Knight and his hounds of Heck!
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"It makes me so happy to be surrounded by so much evil. Oh, look! It's your autobiography. It’s always been a dream of mine to have you read it to me. (He pauses) Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait! (Pulls out a teddy bear) Okay, now I'm ready."
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"(laughs) Come on! Don't be shy. Paragraph 4. ""Upon an evil winter's heart."" Go ahead."
1,31,Perry,"(reading from the book) ""Upon an evil winter's heart, the heavy hand of regret infrequently alights. The malevolent path is one trod without the cumbersome shackles of sentimental introspec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec... spec..."" (He whacks the CD player with the book)"
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying ""spec"" so many times. (Perry rips off his disguise) Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. (Perry, looking annoyed, puts his fedora on. Doofenshmirtz gasps) Perry the Platypus!"
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"I want to say that I knew it was you all along, but I can't because I didn't. So now, I guess I'm supposed to surrender, which I might do if we weren't standing IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EVIL WEAPONS EXPO! (He runs to the giant robots, and gets in one) Ah-ha! Perry the Platypus, your giant robot dragon is no match for my giant robot... Queen Elizabeth I. Hmmm. W- Would you mind switching robots with me? Would you mind too terribly? Please? (They switch robots) Thanks. Thank you very much. I just prefer this one. Thanks. Now, Perry the Platypus, your silly, girly Queen Elizabeth I robot is no match for my giant, fire-breathing... (Perry's robot shoots a laser blast at Doofenshmirtz) Ow! Ow! Wait! I didn't know she had laser eyes. I want to trade back. (Perry sends a punch at Doofenshmirtz) Oof! Well, yours may have laser eyes, but mine breathes (The dragon robot shoots fire from behind Doof) f- (He screams as the fire rushes past) (The dragon robot stops shooting fire) That was a stupid design."
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,Commence with round Two!
1,31,Phineas,"Uh, oh! Ferb, I think we put it on sideways this time."
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,It's a draw!
1,31,TV Announcer,"This just in: A giant mechanical Queen Elizabeth I and a dragon are rampaging through the country engaged in an apparent duel to the death. And in other news, a new version of Jane Eyre is in the offing."
1,31,Lawrence,"(Reading from a newspaper inside a taxicab driving past the fight)) Good heavens, look at that! They're making a new version of Jane Eyre."
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs) Obviously, your Queen Elizabeth I is no match for my dragon! (The Queen Elizabeth robots breaks the headlock she was in) That Queen Elizabeth is a tough old bird."
1,31,Computer,Thank you for pressing the self-destruct button.
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that's just great!"
1,31,Computer,Thank you for pressing the ejection button. Remember to take a parachute with you.
1,31,Doofenshmirtz,Now you tell me!
1,31,Charles,"Look, everyone, it's the ghost of the Black Knight."
1,31,Phineas,I guess he's still in search of the dragon.
1,31,Computer,"To order a parachute, please call our help desk. Self-destruct in 3, 2, 1."
1,31,Candace,"Hi, Charles."
1,31,Grandpa Fletcher,"Jolly good, old bean."
1,31,Phineas,"Ah! There you are, Perry."
1,31,Lawrence,Hello. we had the most amazing time. Look! I found this 19th century barometer. Anything interesting happen 'round here?
1,31,Ferb,I hear there's a new version of Jane Eyre in the offing.

1,35,Linda,"My, Candace, what's got you in such a good mood?"
1,35,Candace,Jeremy asked me to go play croquet with him in the park!
1,35,Lawrence,"Okay, well, be sure to be home in time for the barbecue. We're gonna be watching Kermillian's Comet fly past the Earth."
1,35,Phineas,A comet? Cool!
1,35,Lawrence,It only comes around every seventy three and a half years.
1,35,Linda,We'll be barbecuing steaks for the whole neighborhood! Why don't you bring Jeremy?
1,35,Candace,"You had me at ""steaks""!"
1,35,Phineas,"Why is it called Kermillian's Comet, Dad?"
1,35,Lawrence,"Kermillian's Comet was named after an ancient Danville astronomer, Augustus Kermillian, who discovered the comet."
1,35,Linda,"It's also been said that if you wish on a comet, your wish will come true."
1,35,Phineas,"Wow! Come on, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do today!"
1,35,Lawrence,"By the way, where is Perry?"
1,35,Major Monogram,"(Talking throughout the Flynn-Fletcher's television set) Agent P, (Perry puts on his fedora) Sorry to disturb you, but we have an emergency. We've just been informed that all steaks in the Tri-State area have disappeared. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it. Go lay your smack-down on him, Agent P. The fate of the world rests entirely in your hands."
1,35,Lawrence,"(Walking into the living room) What, the fate of the world?"
1,35,Major Monogram,"Uh, welcome to our telethon. If you're just joining us, your dollars are helping us to find a cure for, um... antidisestablishmentarianism."
1,35,Lawrence,"Goodness me, that sounds dreadful!"
1,35,Major Monogram,"Oh, it is. It, um, makes you look pale and weak, (He shows Carl) like this young lad."
1,35,Lawrence,"Oh dear, the poor thing. Look at that. Wait a minute. Antidisestablishmentarianism? That's more of an ideological stance than a disease. Isn't it?"
1,35,Major Monogram,"Uh, well, look at that. (He hides Carl) Seems they just found a cure. Thanks to all the viewers who donated. Bye now."
1,35,Linda,"Honey, you ready to go?"

1,35,Jeremy,"Well, my folks asked me to keep an eye on Suzy for the afternoon. Who's my favorite girl?"
1,35,Suzy,"I am, I am! (She giggles) Would you show me how to play croquet?"
1,35,Jeremy,"Sure thing, kiddo."
1,35,Candace,Is this pie homemade?
1,35,Jeremy,"Yeah, my Mom made it. I'll go get some plates out of the picnic basket."

1,35,Jeremy,"Candace, what happened?"
1,35,Candace,I don't know.
1,35,Jeremy,Wait here. I'll go get a towel.
1,35,Suzy,"So we meet again, Candace Flynn. There's only room for one girl in Jeremy's life, and that is me. And here he comes now. ... Jeremy!"
1,35,Jeremy,Here's the towel.

1,35,Phineas,"Cool. Hey, Ferb, new hairdo. Check it out."
1,35,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
1,35,Phineas,Ferb and I are building a giant observatory to watch Kermillian's Comet tonight.
1,35,Isabella,"Ooh, that sounds like fun."
1,35,Phineas,"We're gonna put on a laser light show and, as a grand finale, we're gonna laser our faces into the comet. That way, when it comes back in seventy-three and a half years, we can all show our grandchildren. Oh, yeah, my parents are cooking steaks for everyone."
1,35,Isabella,"You had me at ""our grandchildren."""
1,35,Phineas,What?!
1,35,Isabella,"STEAKS! You– you had me at ""steaks."""

1,35,Jeremy,"So, you wanna see those street performers?"
1,35,Candace,Sure.
1,35,Jeremy,I'm gonna go grab some snacks. I'll meet you over there.

Yes, these are my latest invention - steak specs. I came up with the idea after your last little visit. (Doofenshmirtz shows Perry his black eye) With these on, you don't have to constantly hold a piece of steak to your black eye. See? See?... I plan on mass-producing these. I'll make millions. Let me show you. (He shows Perry a containment unit for all the steaks) I've stolen all the steaks in the Tri-State Area, and I keep them here in my steak containment unit or SCU (Pronounced skʰʌ), for short, or maybe it should be SCU (Pronounced skʰu). ... I'm a little on the fence about - Wait. What are you doing? (Perry pulls down a she, revealing an -inator) Oh, that? That's just a giant heat ray in case I want to do something evil later."

1,21,Boy,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. I've got a plan so ingenious it involves military-like stealth, precision and timing. (Screams)"
1,21,Officer,We got us a yeller at quadrant to 6!
1,21,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
1,21,Jeremy,"Oh, hey, Candace."
1,21,Candace,They have a slushy dog here.
1,21,Jeremy,"Yeah, it's new. I'm so bored. Feels like by the time my shift is over, I'll be a part of the fossil exhibit."
1,21,Candace,"(Laughs) Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! (Laughs) Oops, gotta go. That was close."
1,21,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. We're ready to test the circuit quanta stabilizers. Testing."
1,21,Candace,Mom!
1,21,Linda,Did you hear something?
1,21,Candace,"(Laughs) Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! (Laughs)"
1,21,Jeremy,"Yeah, um, where did you run off to?"
1,21,Candace,What do you mean? I didn't go anywhere.
1,21,Jeremy,Right.
1,21,Phineas,Testing #2.
1,21,Jeremy,"So, can I get you something?"
1,21,Candace,"(Laughs) Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! (Laughs)"
1,21,Phineas,We are a go on #3.
1,21,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
1,21,Jeremy,"Candace, you're really kind of freaking me out."
1,21,Officer,"Say, aren't you a little young to be working in a museum?"
1,21,Phineas,Yes. Yes I am.
1,21,Officer,"Well, it's nice to see young people taking an interest in history. Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all?"
1,21,Phineas,"Actually, there seems to be a piece missing. It looks sorta like this. Have you seen it?"
1,21,Officer,Hmm. Looks familiar. I'll keep my eye out for it.
1,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Sorry, Perry the Platypus, I didn't want you to find out this way. Okay, here it is. Peter the Panda is my new nemesis. We met at an evil genius expo in Seattle, and, well, me and Peter, we instantly disliked each other. And then, he foiled a little evil scheme of mine. And, I didn't plan it that way, it just happened. (At Peter the Panda) Peter the Panda, be a dear and go get us a soda. (At Perry) It's not that I don't hate you anymore. I do, but look, I-- I just think it's time for us to, you know, take a break and start fighting other people. (At Peter the Panda) Thank you, Peter the Panda. (Sips) (At Perry) I'd offer you one, Perry the Platypus, but I-- I think it's better if we just have a clean break. Don't you? So, where was I? Oh, yes. (At Peter the Panda) So, Peter the Panda, you think you have outwitted me! (At Perry) Perry the Platypus, you're—you're making this harder than it needs to be. Go on, it's over now. Oh, that? That's a Freeze-Inator ray but, uh, I-- I don't want to explain it again. I just gave the whole spiel to Peter. But, don't worry. He's stopping me. He's-- He's got it well in hand. Goodbye. (At Peter the Panda) Curse you, Peter the Panda!"
1,21,Candace/Officer,(Screams)
1,21,Officer,"You? I thought I tossed you out! Hey, what's this? Stealing a part of a display is serious. Almost yelling serious."
1,21,Phineas,"And last, but not curcuitly not least. Heh, heh."
1,21,Officer,Huh?
1,21,Candace,Mom!
1,21,Officer,Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all?
1,21,Phineas,"Well, uh, yeah. Like I said before, we seem to be missing this piece."
1,21,Officer,Hmm. Looks familiar. I'll keep my eye out for it. Ah! Here it is!
1,21,Phineas,Cool. Thanks.

1,21,Candace,Why am I wearing a turtle on my head? (Screams)
1,21,Phineas,"Hey, what a stroke of luck! Look!"
1,21,Candace,And how is this better?
1,21,Phineas,This one's a vegetarian.
1,21,Candace,So it's not gonna eat us?
1,21,Phineas,Nope.
1,21,Candace,Woo-hoo.
1,21,Phineas,"Uh, excuse me? Yoo-hoo, down here. Hi, we're made of meat, ma'am. Thanks. Wow, isn't this amazing?"
1,21,Candace,"You guys better figure out a way to get us home. 'Cause if we don't get home, I can't bust you for this!"
1,21,Phineas,"Hey, that looks familiar. Guys, come here. Anyone recognize that bad boy?"
1,21,Candace,"Uh, that looks like a footprint from the beast that tried to eat me alive."
1,21,Phineas,"And, it happens to be the very same footprint that's fossilized in the museum."
1,21,Candace,Great. But how does that help us get out of prehistoric times?
1,21,Phineas,Watch and learn.
1,21,Isabella,"It looks like a T-Rex footprint to me. (notices a message in the dinosaur footprint) Hey, look! A message! ""Time machine destroyed! Stuck in 300,000,000 BC. Please help!

1,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, I-- I'm sorry, he does—He doesn't actually talk."
1,21,Dr. Feelbetter,"Ah, I see. And this communication issue is what led you to replace Perry the Platypus?"
1,21,Doofenshmirtz,"No, o-- Of course not! Uh—Peter the Panda doesn't talk either, he—He's a panda bear!"
1,21,Dr. Feelbetter,"I see. Because he's an animal, he doesn't talk."
1,21,Doofenshmirtz,Of course not! What kind of an evil scientist are you?
1,21,Dr. Feelbetter,"Right. Doctor, what if I were to tell you, Peter the Panda is backstage right now."

1,21,Phineas,(monotone) I don't know. Ferb and I have decided to use this time as an opportunity to practice patience.
1,21,Candace,"Lovely. Well, I suppose things can't get any worse. (Rain splashing) Oh, look. The world's first bad hair day."
1,21,Phineas,"Hmm. It just occurred that I may have misspelled ""Time Machine"" on the plans."

1,7,Lawrence,Okay. You lot go on ahead. I'll find a parking spot and meet you there! (drives off)
1,7,Phineas,"We're going up to the monument. Come on, Perry."
1,7,Linda,"Okay, we'll join you in a minute!"
1,7,Candace,"Mom, that's lame."
1,7,Linda,"Okay. How about this cute, cuddly Lincoln?"
1,7,Candace,"Jeremy? (Runs to counter) Hi, Jeremy."
1,7,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
1,7,Candace,What are you doing here?
1,7,Jeremy,"Ah, I'm just here on the Mr. Slushy Burger worker exchange program."
1,7,Candace,"Um... (Clattering) Uh, oh, well, it's my birthday today, and...I...uh... (Clattering) I gotta check something. Back in a flash, 'kay? (Zips off)"
1,7,Isabella,"Hi, Mrs. Fletcher."
1,7,Linda,"Oh, hi, Isabella. What brings you girls here?"
1,7,Isabella,"Fireside Girls field trip. Um, is Phineas here?"
1,7,Linda,Mmm hmm. He and Ferb are up on the monument.
1,7,Phineas,Possibilities.
1,7,Ferb,(Ding)
1,7,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
1,7,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good again. We just discovered his new hideout is located inside Lincoln's head at Mt. Rushmore. (Perry scowls) I-I know. You were just there. Poor planning on our part, actually. Sorry."
1,7,Candace,(growling voice) Phineas?! Ferrrrb?! Ohh.
1,7,Man,"Hey, honey. What are them kids doing up on the monument?"
1,7,Candace,"Let me see that. (Looks through the binoculars, sees Phineas and Ferb on the monument and gasps) Mom! Mom, you've got to see this now. Here, look!"
1,7,Linda,Oop. Ran out of time.
1,7,Candace,"Oh, (Rummaging) here, look now!"
1,7,Linda,"Oh, Old Reliable Geyser. How exciting! (at Candace) I'm just gonna go back to the gift shop."
1,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus! Your timing﻿ is impeccable. And by impeccable I mean: COMPLETELY PECCABLE! (Laughs) You're just in time to witness my latest scheme. Behold, my Drill-Inator! I will bore a tunnel to China, build a toll highway, and make millions!"
1,7,"So, as they say in China",Arrivederci!
1,7,Phineas,"Now, where should we start?"
1,7,Isabella,"(dreamy voice) Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'?"
1,7,Phineas,It's a surprise.
1,7,Isabella,Can I help?
1,7,Phineas,We could use a lookout!
1,7,Isabella,You got it!
1,7,Cashier,"Uh, ma'am, if you handle the big stick, you gotta buy it."
1,7,Candace,Mom! You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing!
1,7,Ranger,"(On megaphone) Uh, excuse me. Aren't you a little young to be restoring a national monument?"
1,7,Ferb,(Holds megaphone)
1,7,Phineas,(On megaphone) Yes. Yes we are.
1,7,Ranger,"Well, it's good to see young people taking an interest in our national heritage."
1,7,Doofenshmirtz,(Grunting and screaming)
1,7,Computer Voice,Hull overheating. Hull overheating.
1,7,Doofenshmirtz,The molten lava of the earth's core completely slipped my mind.
1,7,Candace,Wait 'till you see what those two are up to!
1,7,Isabella,(singsong) She's coming!
1,7,Phineas,We're running a little behind on schedule. Go to Plan B.
1,7,Isabella,"(on bullhorn) Plan B, girls!"
1,7,Candace,"You are gonna be shocked by what I'm about to show you, Mom."
1,7,Linda,"Hmm. I guess things look better in photos. (Phone rings) Oh, it's Dad. (walks away)"
1,7,Lawrence,"Hi, honey! I found an absolutely brilliant parking space!"
1,7,Linda,"(Going down the stairs) Great! I'll meet you at the gift shop, Dear. I still have to buy that big stick."
1,7,Candace,Huh?
1,7,Phineas,Now!
1,7,Phineas,(long pause) Oops.
1,7,Candace,"Huh? (tears up, sobs) Why it's... (sobs) i-it's...IIIIIT'S BEAUUUUTIFULLLL...! (sobs) MOOOOOM!!! (runs off)"
1,7,Candace,Mom! (trips) I've gotta show you something right now! (drags her) Come on! Follow me!
1,7,Linda,"Candace, are you still trying to get the boys in trouble?"
1,7,Candace,"No! No, no, this is a great thing! Oh, it's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me!"
1,7,Linda,"(tries to climb the stairs) You know, Candace, this is the second time I've climbed up there! I'm already down half a dress size!"
1,7,Candace,Come on! Hurry!
1,7,Doofenshmirtz,AAH!
1,7,Candace,"Hurry, Mom! You won't believe it!"
1,7,Linda,"Whew! Finally made it, honey! Now, what is it you wanted me to see?"
1,7,Candace,Bu...bu...!
1,7,Linda,"You're right! It's beautiful! (hugs her) Happy birthday, honey. (Kisses Candace's cheek) Now let's go find your father."
1,7,Candace,Ugh! (bangs her head on the iron rod)
1,7,Phineas,Did ya like your birthday present?
1,7,Candace,"Uh-huh, uh... (walks away)"
1,7,Ferb,"Well, it was definitely better than the gorilla in the cake."
1,7,Jeremy,"(comes over with a gift box) Hey, Candace! I had a break, and I, uh, I thought I'd give you this for you birthday. (Gives her the box, she opens it) I saw you looking at it in the gift shop."
1,7,(Candace takes out her present,)
1,7,Candace,A Mt. Rushmore bobble head.
1,7,Jeremy,Eh -- You like it?
1,7,Candace,(Dreamly) Oh! I absolutely love it...
1,7,Jeremy,Great. I gotta get back. Happy birthday! (walks away waving)
1,7,Candace,This was the best birthday ever! (walks away)
1,20,Linda,What a beautiful summer day. Do you boys have anything exciting planned?
1,20,Phineas,"We're either gonna make this nuclear-powered submarine or this incredible shrinking ray. But for some reason, Ferb and I can't seem to make up our minds."
1,20,Linda,"Well, I've made up my mind. (hugs them) You two have the most wonderful imaginations."
1,20,Candace,"It's real, you know."
1,20,Linda,"What's real, dear?"
1,20,Candace,The submarine? The shrinking ray? They're really gonna build that stuff.
1,20,Phineas,"(walks up) Well, actually we haven't (Candace pushes him away with her spoon) decided yet--"
1,20,Candace,"(talking fast) Anyway, when I try to bust them, everything will just magically disappear. Always happens. you'll see. Well, you won't see. I'll see, trust me."
1,20,Linda,"(Oblivious) As usual, the imagination in this room is astounding! (walks away)"
1,20,Candace,(With the spoon in her mouth) Hello?
1,20,Jeremy,"(On phone) Hi, Candace. (cut to him) It's Jeremy. I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk today?"
1,20,Candace,I would very much enjoy going for a walk. Wherever shall we go?
1,20,Jeremy,To my uncle's restaurant?
1,20,Candace,"Yes! That sounds do-able! Why not pick me up around noon? Okay! Goodbye. (hangs up, dials) Oh, my gosh! Guess who just called and asked me out on a date!"
1,20,Stacy,(On phone) Who!?
1,20,Candace,Jeremy!
1,20,Stacy,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Stacy,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Stacy,(On phone) Hold on! Let's conference in Jenny!
1,20,Candace,Okay! (dials) Ahh!
1,20,Stacy/Jenny,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Stacy/Jenny,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Stacy/Jenny,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Stacy/Jenny,(On phone) Ahh!
1,20,Candace,Ahh!
1,20,Phineas,(overlapping) LET'S GO OUTSIDE!
1,20,Phineas,"Submarine, shrinking ray. I just can't make up my mind!"
1,20,Isabella,(offscreen) What'cha doooin'?
1,20,Phineas,"Oh. Hi, Isabella."
1,20,Isabella,"(Walks up walking her dog) Hi, Phineas! You remember Pinky."
1,20,Phineas,"(offscreen) Oh, yeah! Hi, Pinky!"
1,20,Isabella,"(Showing her Fireside sash) Hey, check out my new sash! It's got all my accomplishment patches sewn onto it. (holds aforesaid sash in front of him) See?"
1,20,Phineas,Wow. That looks totally irreplaceable.
1,20,Isabella,"Oh no! Pinky, I need that sash for a Fireside Girls ceremony this afternoon!"
1,20,Phineas,"Don't worry, Isabella, we'll get your sash back."
1,20,Isabella,But how? It's in Pinky's stomach.
1,20,Phineas,"Hmm... (realizing) Ferb, you're a genius! Hey, where's Perry?"
1,20,Major Monogram,"Agent P, thanks for coming. It's Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been hiding out in the old abandoned vacuum cleaner factory. You know, at building across town with the giant vacuum cleaner on top? Man, I can't believe that place closed. I blame the Internet. (pause) Your mission, Agent P, is to find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to and then stop him."
1,20,Isabella,"So, how are we gonna retrieve my sash?"
1,20,Phineas,"Here. Ferb made this multimedia presentation. We shrink the sub down with Ferb and me in it and put in Pinky's dog food. After he eats us, the sub extrudes two mechanical arms, which fold up the sash to microscopic size and pull it into the sash storage unit. Finally, we pilot up into the mouth and have Pinky drool us out. Easy."
1,20,Isabella,"Gross, but cool! But Pinky will eat anything but dog food. He likes grilled cheese sandwiches."
1,20,Phineas,Not a problem. You make the sandwich. We'll make the sub.
1,20,Man,"Okay. A subatomic shrinking module, hydrostatic ballast tank, and a case of AA batteries. Sign here, please."
1,20,Phineas,Aren't you wondering if we're a little young to be building a submarine?
1,20,Man,"Yes, yes I am."
1,20,Phineas,Yeah. We get that a lot.
1,20,Isabella,"One grilled cheese sandwich, hot off the... Oh, cool!"
1,20,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella. You're just in time."
1,20,Isabella,You guys amaze me.
1,20,Phineas,"When we're inside, we'll activate the shrinkage. You take care of the rest."
1,20,Isabella,"Check it out, Pinky, your favorite."
1,20,Phineas,Ready?
1,20,Isabella,"It worked! All right, Pinky-Winky, time for some cheesy-weesy!"
1,20,Isabella,"(While running after Pinky) No, Pinky! Chasing the cat is so cliche! You're better than that!"
1,20,Candace,"(after opening the door to the garage) Listen up! Jeremy will be here any second and I wanna tell you... (notices the grilled cheese sandwich) Ooh, grilled cheese, my favorite. Might as well eat now, so I don't look like a pig on my date."
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? I... You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape, then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little. Let me tell you what. I will tell you my scheme first and then I will trap you! What do you say, huh? Yes, this is much better. Okay, so here it is. The Make-Up-Your-Mind-inator! (chuckles) You know, when you're waiting to order a pizza and the person in front of you can't decide on a topping. Ohh, I hate that! I hate it! (mumbles) I will destroy anyone who can't make up their mind!"
1,20,Phineas,Ferb and I can't seem to make up our minds.
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Should I go with Make-Up-Your-Mind-inator? Or is that too-on-the-nose? It's funny. Now I can't make up my mind. Oof! (Perry attacks Doofenshmirtz in a frenzy and cuffs him to a wall) Perry the Platypus! What are... Well, I--I did not see that coming."
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Calling headquarters, huh? Hmm. Yes, you—you didn't even give me a chance to trap you."
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,See? I was going to put you in that giant snow globe over there. (Camera switches back to him) Now I have to return it.
1,20,Major Monogram,"Agent P! What's wrong? Oh! You caught Doofenshmirtz, huh? That's weird. Usually he traps you, then you escape and then..."
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,We mixed it up a little!
1,20,Major Monogram,"Hang tight, Agent P. Backup is on the way. I mean, it would be, if we had some. Uh, I'm gonna make some calls."
1,20,Candace,"Oh, yeah. (chewing noisily) This is good."
1,20,Phineas,It worked! Pinky's chewing! Prepare for swallowing!
1,20,Candace,(Gasps) Jeremy's here! (Gulps)
1,20,Phineas,Whoa! Whaah! (Sonar pinging) Wow. Pinky's neck is really long.
1,20,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
1,20,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
1,20,Phineas,Whoa!
1,20,Candace,(Belches) Heh heh. Heh. Excuse me.
1,20,Phineas,"We did it, Ferb! We're inside Pinky. How about a little road trip music?"
1,20,(Song,Hemoglobin Highway)
1,20,Phineas,"Now to find that sash. Hey, tacos! Ah, tacos. You know who makes the best tacos? Mom. These kind of remind me of the ones we had... for dinner last night. Hey, Pinky didn't have dinner with us. Wait a minute. Candace's favorite cereal?"
1,20,Phineas,Hello?
1,20,Isabella,"Phineas, where are you? Pinky ran away, and when I came back, the sandwich was gone!"
1,20,Phineas,"Okay, let me call you back. (to Ferb) Yeah, we're inside Candace's stomach."
1,20,Ferb,That's creepy on so many levels.
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"(Looking at his watch) This backup of yours is taking forever. (Points to the left while Perry gets up and stretches) I have a travel chess set in my bag over there. (Perry walks in the opposite direction) Do you play chess? (Still pointing to the left) Over there, actually."
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha ha ha ha! I tricked you, Perry the Platypus! (Takes a hairpin from his hair then uses it to pick the lock on the handcuff) Do you like my Any-Flat-Surface-Magnet-Belt? It sticks to any flat surface. Hee hee hee hee. Guess what? There's no travel chess set in this bag, either. (gets trapped by the other magnet belt) There was one of these in both bags, so whichever one you chose, you would be stuck. Just like I'm... stuck... right now. What, uh... wh-what time is that backup getting here again?"
1,20,Phineas,"Oh, here we are. Let's tap into Candace's nerve center so we can see what she sees. Ears. Eyes. Look, we're getting an image. She's on her date with Jeremy. That means we're on a date with Jeremy."
1,20,Ferb,"Again, creepy on so many levels."
1,20,Candace,"Oh, excuse me. My phone is ringing. Hello?"
1,20,Phineas,"Candace, I know this sounds weird, but Ferb and I shrunk down in a submarine. We were in that sandwich you ate, and now we're in your stomach."
1,20,Candace,Are you wacko? Don't call me!
1,20,Phineas,"Wait! We can prove it! (to Ferb) How do we prove it? ""(Ferb pulles up a feather duster to tickle Candace's insides)"
1,20,Candace,(Laughing) Whoo! Yeah! (Whispering harshly) What is going on?
1,20,Phineas,"Hey, monkey bars. Do you still get sick when you hang upside down?"
1,20,Candace,Yeah. Why?
1,20,Phineas,"Sorry, Candace. We have to help Isabella. So, arms and legs!"
1,20,Jeremy,"Candace, are you okay?"
1,20,Candace,"Heh heh. Heh. Never better. Never better! (straining) Phineas, I'm going to... (Gulps)"
1,20,Phineas,It's working! All right! Yeah! What happened?
1,20,Jeremy,"Candace, you sure you're okay?"
1,20,Jeremy,"Come on, my uncle's restaurant is right over here."
1,20,Phineas,"Any other ideas? ""(Ferb pulls out the feather duster again and tickles the inside of Candace's throat)"""
1,20,Candace,"(Coughs, clears throat) I have a tickle in my throat. (Clearing throat)"
1,20,Jeremy,Stay right here. I'm gonna go get some water.
1,20,Phineas,We did it!
1,20,Candace,You guys are so busted!
1,20,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Candace."
1,20,Linda,(on the phone) Hello?
1,20,Candace,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a SHRINKING SUBMARINE!"
1,20,Linda,"(on the phone) Candace, I'll see it later. Right now, I have to swing by Jeremy's uncle's restaurant and pick up some sandwiches for your father."
1,20,Candace,Perfect!
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Farewell, Perry the Platypus!"
1,20,Candace,Mom Mom Mom?! Submarine submarine!
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,(screaming) (falls into the submarine)
1,20,Candace,See? It's a submarine!!!
1,20,Candace,(facepalms) URRRG!
1,20,Linda,So... (walks away) imaginative.
1,20,Isabella,"Hey, I been lookin' everywhere for you guys! Pinky threw up and I got my sash back!"
1,20,Phineas,"Hmm. Gross, but cool. Speaking of pets..."
1,20,Phineas,"Where ya been, Perry?"
1,20,Jeremy,"Candace, I have a surprise for you. Check it out."
1,20,Candace,"Sandwich menu? ""The Candace Special""? Oh, you had a sandwich named after me?"
1,20,Jeremy,"Yeah. Grilled cheese, 'cause I know it's your favorite."
1,20,Jeremy,Shall we eat inside?
1,20,Candace,This is the end of a perfect day. My very own sandwich! I can't wait to try it!
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello? Where am I? Oh, it's all gastrointestiney in here. Hmm... Brain. (gasps) I'm inside a dog!"
1,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Perfect. Now I can pee all over the Tri-State Area! Ha ha ha ha ha! (sighs) Oh, what am I doing with my life?"
1,34,Buford,Prepare to feel the wrath of Buford.
1,34,Isabella,Don't bring that smack-talk around here. This is my house!
1,34,Phineas,"Technically, this is our garage."
1,34,Ferb,She's on a roll.
1,34,Buford,No girl has ever beaten Buford. Watch and learn. It takes a highly trained eye and a quick wrist to...
1,34,Isabella,"To score like that, Buford?"
1,34,Buford,(Recovers from initial shock) Hey! I wasn't ready.
1,34,Candace,"Stacy, what am I going to do? Jeremy's coming over to take my picture for his photo class."
1,34,Stacy,"So, what's the...? (notices Candace's hair) Oh!"
1,34,Candace,"(reveals her hair is messed up) Yeah, you think he'll notice? This is the worst bad hair day ever! I'm officially freaking out! (picks up her cell phone) I'll call and cancel."
1,34,Stacy,"No, wait! Just wear a hat."
1,34,Candace,Yeah! A hat! ..... How's this?
1,34,Stacy,"Well, your hair looks better."
1,34,Candace,"Yeah, but the strap is cutting off my... (the hat rips off) I'm gonna need something stronger."
1,34,Buford,Alright! This is the tie-breaker.
1,34,Isabella,I thought the last two were.
1,34,Buford,Nah. It's this one.
1,34,Isabella,"Tell you what I'm going to do, Buford. I'm going take this ball and I'm going hit into your goal in one shot."
1,34,Buford,"Oh, is that right?"
1,34,Isabella,"Absolutely, and you want to know the funny part? There's nothing you can do about it!"
1,34,Buford,Bring it!
1,34,Buford,(Laughs) You missed.
1,34,Isabella,Wait for it.
1,34,Candace,What about this?
1,34,Isabella,"Ain't that how it works, Buford?"
1,34,Phineas,"Wow. Nice foosing, Isabella."
1,34,Isabella,Thanks.
1,34,Candace,"You guys are making such a racket that I can't focus. I need time to fix my hair. 'Cause when Jeremy gets here, I don't wanna be wearing this stupid--"
1,34,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
1,34,Candace,"Hello, Jeremy. Ha."
1,34,Jeremy,You look sporty.
1,34,Candace,"Oh, you like it?"
1,34,Jeremy,"Well, that's perfect. (holds up a camera) The sport shoot."
1,34,Buford,"Well, that didn't really count, 'cause it's just a dainty little girls' game."
1,34,Isabella,"It could be the biggest game in the world, and girls could still beat boys. (pauses) Biggest game in the world. Did you get that, Phineas?"
1,34,Phineas,"Yeah, we're on it. (at Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
1,34,Buford,"Great. It's boys against girls. And to give ya a fair shot, I'll even take Shrimpy here."
1,34,Baljeet,I am honored.
1,34,Buford,"So, who's on your team?"
1,34,Isabella,"Candace, can you be on the girls' team with me?"
1,34,Candace,"Isabella, I'm a little busy right--"
1,34,Jeremy,"Perfect. Real action shots. Oh, you'll look great."
1,34,Candace,"Really? OK, I'm in."
1,34,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
1,34,Major Monogram,"There you are, Agent P. Sorry about the stairs, our elevator maintenance guy is on a corporate retreat with our slide-waxing guy. Anyway, our intelligence tells us that Doofenshmirtz has been shopping around for a show dog. We need you to infiltrate the pet store and uncover his evil plan. Me, I'm goin' home early. It's taco night. Ha-ha."
1,34,Phineas,So those are the official rules for the F-Games. Any questions?
1,34,Buford,Yeah. Why are they called the F-Games?
1,34,Isabella,Yeah.
1,34,Candace,"Yeah, why is that?"
1,34,Phineas,"""F"" for Ferb."
1,34,All,(gasp) Ohh.
1,34,Baljeet,"I, too, have a question. If I miss the third shuttlecock with my rubber chicken, does Buford have to jump over the chokecherry bush before or after the girls finish peeling their tangerines?"
1,34,All but Baljeet,After!!
1,34,Buford,"Aw, man, pay attention. You're embarrassing me."
1,34,Phineas,"All right, then let's get out there."
1,34,Buford,"Wow, definitely big."
1,34,(Song,"""F-Games"")"
1,34,Phineas,"Ooh. Extra points for recycling. The girls' score is now the square root of pi, while the boys still have a crudely drawn picture of a duck. Clearly, it's still anyone's game."
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, I'm looking for a purebred show dog."
1,34,Shop owner,"Well, we have various award-winning breeds to choose from."
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, what about him?"
1,34,Doofenshimrtz,"Oh, he's perfect. Oh, yes. Coochie-coochie-coo. You are Doctor D's precious little puppy, aren't you?"
1,34,Shop owner,"Sir, I'm not even sure if that's a dog."
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't try to wheel and deal with me. I get a big alimony check every month, so money's no object."
1,34,Shop owner,"Oh; well, in that case, he's ten thousand dollars."
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, coochie-coochie. You are my little coochie-coochie. You are my ticket into the Danville Dog Show, and together, we will make them pay for all I have suffered."
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"And don't worry about your lack of training and experience, because I have an ace in the hole. .... This - the Misbehav-inator. It, uh, well, it does what the name implies. Watch this. (dog yips) Ha-ha-ha. Bad dog! (dog barks) Ah, nothing can stop us now. Hee-hee-hee-hee. (gasps) Aah! Hey, what was all that about?"
1,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Uh, ha-ha, now I'm very embarrassed about all that ""coochie-coochie-coo"" stuff. Wait, wait. Where are you going? Bring back my Misbehav-inator!"
1,34,Phineas,And now for the tiebreaker event. Giant foosball. Get ready to foos.
1,34,Buford,This is so my game.
1,34,Baljeet,But didn't Isabella beat you at this earlier?
1,34,Buford,"Quiet, you!"
1,34,Isabella,"Ready, Candace?"
1,34,Candace,I feel like a kebab.
1,34,Baljeet,"I, too, feel a certain element of kebabism."
1,34,Buford,"I said quiet, you. Let's play."
1,34,Phineas,There's the first ball.
1,34,Baljeet,I feel this may not be the best way to block a shot. Clearly I was - Clearly I was wrong about that. That was most effective. Aah!
1,34,Candace,What?
1,34,Phineas,Candace blocks. The ball is up...

1,34,Phineas,..it's going...it's going... It's going!...
1,34,Baljeet,"Oh, my. Ohh!"
1,34,Candace,"Aah! Ohh! Isabella, I have feet too, you know."
1,34,Isabella,"Sorry, Candace."
1,34,Baljeet,Aaaah! Suddenly I am not feeling so fresh.
1,34,Phineas,Looks like we've reached the all-important fruit level!
1,34,Candace,The what? (Watermelon destroys her helmet. Buford laughs and ends up with a fruit in his mouth. Ferb continues to shoot fruit everywhere.)
1,34,Phineas,"It looks like the final ball is drifting lazily into neutral territory. Folks, we may be looking at a draw."
1,34,Buford,"Oh, no, we're not."
1,34,Baljeet,"Buford, no! That would be cheating."
1,34,Buford,Heh-heh-heh-heh. Boys rule!
1,34,Candace,"Aah, my hair! Jeremy's gonna see my hair!"
1,34,(Isabella spins Candace; ball whistling. Ball ricochets off Candace flying towards Buford) Buford,"Uh-oh. (Ball hits his stomach, which goes flying and ends up crashing the wall of the territory) WHOOOH!"
1,34,Phineas,They've done it! The girls have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat!
1,34,Jeremy,"Wow, Candace, your hair looks great."
1,34,Candace,(giggles) Really?
1,34,Isabella,"Well, Buford, that was a great game. Come on, be a good sport."
1,34,Buford,"Like I said before, losing to a girl doesn't count. (gets zapped by Doofenshmirtz's -inator) What I meant to say was I had a wonderful time. I guess you were right. Girls are just as good as boys. Thanks again. Woo-hoo! The F-Games rock."
1,34,Ferb,That was completely out of character.
1,34,Man,"T minus 3, 2, 1."
1,34,Isabella,"Thanks, guys. It was a lot of fun."
1,34,Phineas,The next F-Games will be even better.
1,34,Candace,"Yeah, but much better is when Mom sees this. Look at that thing. I'd just like to see you try to get rid of that before Mom ---"
1,34,Linda,"Hey, kids! What's new?"
1,34,Candace,"Nothing, Mom. Absolutely nothing is new."
1,34,Linda,"(Feeling Candace's hair) Well, your hair sure looks new. I like it."
1,34,Candace,Thanks. It took a lot to get it this way.
1,34,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
1,22,Linda,So you really don't know what day it is?
1,22,Lawrence,"I told you, it's Thursday."
1,22,Linda,"It is more than just another Thursday, Lawrence."
1,22,Lawrence,Then it must be...the day I realized how cute you are when you're angry? (Phineas and Ferb stare at each other)
1,22,Linda,I'm going to get my hair done. I'll be back at 2. Maybe you can figure it out before I get home.
1,22,Lawrence,"Oh, I wonder what all the fuss is about."
1,22,Candace,Ahem.
1,22,Lawrence,Huh?
1,22,Candace,June 15th. It's your wedding anniversary!
1,22,Lawrence,"Ooh! Egads! Wait, wait! I can fix this!"
1,22,Phineas,"Gee, Candace, isn't this a lot of fuss to make over a date?"
1,22,Candace,"Are you kidding? Anniversaries are very important. Take June, for example. On the 3rd, Jeremy spoke to me for the first time back in the 7th grade. May 6th, he brushed up against me in the hall. Oh, and April 3rd - that's the day he laughed so hard, milk came out of his nose! (laughs) He looked so cute."
1,22,Phineas,"Hey, Dad, can we help?"
1,22,Lawrence,"Well, I'm afraid not, unless you can perform miracles."
1,22,Phineas,What's your budget?
1,22,Lawrence,"Tell, me boys, what would you get a special woman on her anniversary?"
1,22,Candace,"Oh, please! Asking two boys for romantic advice? Now that's just pathetic. Don't you and Mom have any cherished memories?"
1,22,Lawrence,"Oh, yes. I've got just the thing in here. (begins rummaging around in his toolbox)"
1,22,Candace,"(at Phineas and Ferb, under her breath) He keeps his treasured memories in a toolbox."
1,22,Lawrence,Your mother's favorite band. Love Händel.
1,22,Lawrence,"(voice over) I bought us tickets to their farewell concert. Oh, we were a handsome, stylish couple back in those days."
1,22,Danny,So which lucky couple out there will be caught in our flamin' hot spotlight of love?
1,22,Lawrence,"(voice over) I'd never so much as held your mother's hand, but that night, I made my move."
1,22,Danny,"Well, don't just stand there, man. Kiss her. (Lawrence looks up at Danny, still confused, but Linda kisses him. The crowd cheers.)"
1,22,Danny,♪ You snuck your way right into my heart ♪
1,22,Lawrence,"Truly that was an evening I will never, ever forget."
1,22,Candace,"But you did forget, didn't ya?"
1,22,Lawrence,(groans) But Love Händel broke up years ago. Some things can never be recaptured.
1,22,Phineas,"That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make it their best anniversary ever. Hey, where's Perry?"
1,22,Major Monogram,"Ah, there you are, Agent P. We've learned some alarming information. Several suspicious items have been purchased by the Doofenshmirtz Corporation. They include: an industrial-grade air compressor, 20 canisters of helium oxide and 400 pounds of fireworks. Get right on it."
1,22,Narrator,"(over a rock ballad) For a moment, their ballad, ""Snuck Your Way Into My Heart"", snuck its way to number one and stayed there for 11 consecutive minutes. But whatever happened to Love Händel? The band was riding high, but tastes were changing, and Love Händel found itself playing smaller and smaller venues. Pressures from a dwindling fan base caused in-fighting among the band members. Lines were drawn. Then lines were crossed. Eventually the lines were erased, and the piece of paper crumpled up and thrown away, and Love Händel was no more. Years later, Love Händel's music continues to warm the hearts of an appreciative public. Bass player Bobbi Fabulous now runs a trendy hair salon, drummer Swampy works quietly at the public library, and only lead singer Danny is still a player in the music industry. (The screen shows a picture of Danny's Music Shop.)"
1,22,Candace,I've seen that sign. It's down on Main Street.
1,22,Phineas,"We'll get him to sing for Mom! Ready, team? (holds out his hand)"
1,22,Candace,"Team? Oh, no, I am not getting involved in one of your crazy schemes."
1,22,Phineas,"Come on, Candace. For true love? (Blinks at her pleadingly)"
1,22,Candace,Ugh!
1,22,Phineas,"Candace, you keep Mom away from the house. We'll go get Danny."
1,22,Lawrence,"Ooh. ""Love on the Run. Romantic solutions for every occasion."""

1,22,Lawrence,"Yes. Well, be careful."
1,22,Phineas,"Come on, Ferb."
1,22,Candace,"(cell phone rings) Oh, hey, Stacy. I can't talk right now. My brothers and I are reforming Love Händel for a concert in our backyard."
1,22,Stacy,"Love Händel? That's my mother's favorite band! (phone beeps) Hey, Mom, did you know Love Händel is reforming?"
1,22,Dr. Hirano,Love Händel? (expands to numerous people talking) Love Händel? Love Händel? Love Händel?
1,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasps) Perry the Platypus. Quick, could you hand me that staple gun right over there? Thank you. Ahh... So what do you think? It's for my daughter Vanessa's birthday. I try to throw her a party every year. (He pulls out a roll of pictures, each with an unhappy Vanessa at an excessively girly party.) I know we usually go about our daily battle of good versus evil, but instead, could you maybe help me set up the party for my little girl? Please?"

1,22,Phineas,"Uh, you must be Danny of Love Händel, right?"
1,22,Danny,"Always an honor to be recognized by my fans. Hey, aren't you a little young to be fans of Love Händel?"
1,22,Phineas,"Yes, we are, but our parents aren't. Don't you think you were a little tough on that guy?"
1,22,Danny,"Oh, he'll be back... when the spirit calls him!"

1,36,Owner,"But kids today only go for the stuff that's all shiny and new and high-tech. Ah, the Scotsman in me tells me (♪ Bagpipes) to hold on stubbornly to the bitter end! But then again, I'm half Irish. (♪ Irish dance)"
1,36,Phineas,"That's too bad. This was the perfect day for miniature golf. Hey, everyone, I know what we're gonna do today."
1,36,Phineas,"(to Linda) Hi, Mom. We'll be out back building a miniature golf course."
1,36,Linda,"That's fine, dear. After all, it's only golf in miniature."
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) What's that?
1,36,Stacy,Your brothers own a giant crane? No way!
1,36,Candace,They are so bu... bu... bu... (Writes on a notepad then hands it to Stacy)
1,36,Stacy,"What's this? Dancing weasels? (Candace rotates the notepad) Oh, ""busted."" Oh, you want me to bust your brothers. You know, you really gotta work on your penmanship."
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) Find out what they're up to and report back to me.
1,36,Stacy,No problemo. I'll handle it.
1,36,Candace,Ah-ah... achoo!
1,36,Phineas,(Gasps) Awesome plan. We should be finished before lunch.
1,36,Stacy,"Listen up, twerps. Just because Candace is sick doesn't mean you can get away with anything. I am now her eyes, ears and mouth. Basically I'm her whole face."
1,36,Phineas,What a good friend.
1,36,Stacy,"Yeah, right? She wrote you this message."
1,36,Phineas,Hmm... Weasels. I think she means it.
1,36,Stacy,"I knew they were weasels! So anyway, what's all this?"
1,36,Phineas,We're only making the greatest miniature golf course in the whole world! Or at least in Danville.
1,36,Stacy,Isn't it kind of big?
1,36,Phineas,"Well, you know, it isn't golf in miniature."
1,36,Stacy,"It's miniature golf! And it's so unbelievably cool! With a windmill and a dinosaur, and – (Candace silences Stacy by covering her mouth with her hand)"
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) You must not be seduced by the coolness! Focus!
1,36,Stacy,"You're right. I can do this if I stay focused. Focus, focus, focus! Hey, where's Perry?"
1,36,Major Monogram,"Just looking over your request for vacation time. We're ready to approve it, but there's one small problem. And by ""small problem,"" I mean ""big problem."" And by ""approve it,"" I mean ""deny it."" Sorry, Agent P. I know you've been putting in a lot of extra hours, but we've got word that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has bought a new house in the suburbs. Three bedroom, two and a half baths, central air. Nice place. We need you to find out what he's up to. Here's his new address. Good luck, Agent P."
1,36,Stacy,"Okay. Focus, focus, focus. You can do this, Stacy. Don't get seduced by the coolness. Wuh-oh. ""Elevator to the coolness""? (Steps on to the elevator) This is so cool!"
1,36,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, you're up."
1,36,Stacy,Phineas.
1,36,Phineas,"Oh. Hey, Stacy. What do you think of our miniature golf course?"
1,36,Stacy,"It's so... I mean, I've come to deliver a message with an unimpressed demeanor."
1,36,Phineas,Cool. We're on our way to the next hole. Why don't you come along?
1,36,Stacy,"Well, okay, but--"
1,36,Phineas,Great!
1,36,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"")"
1,36,Phineas,"So, Stacy, what was it you were gonna tell us?"
1,36,Stacy,"Oh, right, well, Candace is gonna... call...!"
1,36,Stacy,"What kind of hole is this, anyway?"
1,36,Phineas,It's the air hockey hole. Check it out.
1,36,Stacy,Wicked!
1,36,Buford,"Hey, look at us. We're glidin' on air."
1,36,Stacy,"Hole in one! I mean, goal! I mean..."
1,36,Stacy,"Yeah! We all, like, freaked out! Can you believe it?"
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) No, no, I can't. Did you, by any chance, tell them I was going to call mom?"
1,36,Stacy,"Uh, I was gonna, but the elevator and the slide, and... (Candace slaps her hand over Stacy's mouth)"
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) Hush! Focus! We need evidence! Two words: video phone.
1,36,Male Voice,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. Translated into evil. Chapter one. ""Tom Sawyer's dislike of Aunt Polly was rivaled only by his hatred of puppies."""
1,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Waah! Oof! Perry the Platypus! You scared the dunkelschtup out of me! Don't you know it's rude to bust in on someone's new home unannounced and... (Gasps) A housewarming gift? Oh, how thoughtful! How thoughtful. Thank you. Look, Perry the Platypus, as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not really up to anything terribly nasty today. So, you're welcome to chill out here for the day. It's nice, huh? Huh? What do you think? If you need, I'll even sign something that says I was up to no good."
1,36,Stacy,Are you catching this?
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) Yes! Yes! This time we've got them, but you need get the boys in the picture. (Giggles then Coughs)"
1,36,Phineas,There you are. We've been looking all over for you.
1,36,Stacy,Me?
1,36,Phineas,You gotta play through.
1,36,Stacy,Hold this.
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) Stacy, what are you doing? Focus!"
1,36,Phineas,Nice focus.
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) Aahh!
1,36,Stacy,What was that?
1,36,Phineas,Sounds like the crowd's going wild.
1,36,Stacy,That is so cool!
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) Aah!
1,36,Stacy,"Whoo-hoo! Yes, yes, yes!"
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) No, no, no!"
1,36,Phineas,"Well, here we are. We've reached the final hole. You better put on your dancin' shoes."
1,36,(Song,"""Disco Miniature Golfing Queen"")"
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) Poor Stacy. What was I thinking? Okay, Candace. Looks like it's up to you. (She gets off her bed. As she takes tiny steps her slippers squeak)"
1,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, this is nice, eh? But, you know, I don't think suburban life is for me. I'm thinking of just adding a breakfast nook and flipping the property. The main problem is my neighbor, Phil. He is truly diabolical. His fruit falls into my yard, his dog poops on my lawn, he leaves his trash cans out too long, and... Oh, I'm at my wit's end! And the worst, the absolute worst, is his leaf blower."
1,36,"Behold, Perry the Platypus! The ultimate suburban weapon",the Atomic Leaf Blower-inator! This will be the last time his stray leaves blow onto my lawn.
1,36,Candace,"(Hoarsely) At least the golf course can't vanish if they're still in it. Come on, Mom."
1,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Phil the neighbor!"
1,36,Linda,"Candace, what are you doing out of bed? Wasn't Stacy taking care of you?"
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) She was seduced by the coolness. Follow that miniature golf course!
1,36,Linda,What does that even mean?
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) Look behind you!
1,36,Linda,I don't see anything.
1,36,Farmer's wife,You know you should've been setting aside a portion of your profits over the years with the understatement that money would be used to upgrade your vestment. What did you think? A shiny new miniature golf course would just fall out of the sky?
1,36,Owner,You'd be surprised what falls out of the sky in Danville.
1,36,Linda,"Oh, isn't that great? They remodeled Little Duffers."
1,36,Phineas,I still don't know how we ended up at Little Duffers.
1,36,Ferb,I don't know why we didn't build it here in the first place.
1,36,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
1,36,Stacy,"Candace! Did you hear? I won! I actually won in miniature golf! It just goes to show you that if you focus, you can accomplish anything. (Sneezes)"
1,36,Stacy,"Sorry, I forgot to bust your brothers."
1,36,Candace,(Hoarsely) It's okay. I'm sorry I got you sick.
1,5,Candace,"""To think... To dream... Whether 'tis nobler to love, I know not."" Ah, The Princess Sensibilities. My favorite play. What is going on out there?!"
1,5,Phineas,"Not so little anymore. Last week our website got 176,000,000 hits."
1,5,Linda,"Oh, sorry I'm late. They're filming down the street."
1,5,Candace,Filming? What What are they filming?
1,5,Linda,A movie version of the play The Princess Sensibilities.
1,5,Candace,(Gasps) I would be perfect for that part! I've been practicing it for my drama club all summer! I'm gonna get discovered!
1,5,Phineas,"That's serendipitous. Hey, where's Perry?"
1,5,Major Monogram,"There you are, Agent P. There's something very strange going on with Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been very quiet lately. A little too quiet. I want you to find out what's not going on, and...uh...put a...stop..to it. I suppose. Good luck, Agent P."
1,5,Candace,"There it is! Excuse me. Uh, Mr. Producer, sir?"
1,5,Producer,I can't talk to you right now. My lead actress just quit!
1,5,Candace,"Well sir, this is your lucky day! (Clears throat) I will replace her. Besides, I know her lines by heart. Listen. ""To think, to dream, whether 'tis nobler to love, I know not."""
1,5,Producer,"Heh. That's not bad. And you know your lines. Mmm, I don't know."
1,5,Candace,I'll do it for free.
1,5,Producer,You're hired.
1,5,Candace,Really?
1,5,Producer,"You bet! With the money I save, I'll be able to hire the hottest new directors in town. Hello?"
1,5,Candace,Wow! I could get used to this!
1,5,Man,"Miss Candace Flynn, here's your contract and your bagel. This is Antoine, your dialog coach, Nikki, your swimming stand-in, and your personal trainers Olga and Chicago Joe."
1,5,Olga,"Charmed, I'm sure."
1,5,Chicago Joe,Drop and give me 20!
1,5,Producer,"Candace, baby! Let me introduce you to the directors of this film."
1,5,Phineas,"Hi, Candace."
1,5,Candace,Phineas and Ferb? What are you doing here?
1,5,Phineas,We're directing the movie. Our new agent arranged the whole thing.
1,5,Isabella,"Look. My client gets 3% of the gross and a piece of the back end, or he walks. Yeah, that's right. You mess with the bull, you get the horns, buddy. (Phone rings) Hello? Syd, baby, you got that 3rd act in line yet?"
1,5,Candace,"Wait, wait! Don't you think they're a little young to be big-budget movie directors?"
1,5,Producer,"With 176,000,000 hits, they could be in diapers for all I care."
1,5,Candace,"Phineas, I don't remember any monsters in The Princess Sensibilities."
1,5,Phineas,We just finished the rewrites this morning.
1,5,Candace,"""The Curse of the Princess Monster""? That is not what I signed up for! Besides, I can't wear this! No one will see my face!"
1,5,Producer,"Yes, but in the end, the curse is lifted! And in your big dramatic scene, you will look stunning! This film could make you a star."
1,5,Candace,Really? A...a...star?
1,5,Man,Hey! Ugly monster! You're needed on the set!
1,5,Candace,I'm coming! (Music playing) Oof! Oof! Won't you stay on? Oof! Darn!
1,5,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Why do you keep breaking down my doors? Why don't you knock first? It's not even locked! This time, you'll pay. That's right, fork it over. What? Are you kidding me? This isn't just drywall, you know! It's solid oak! That's more like it. You can't just go busting into people's houses for no reason, you know. Besides, I've given up evil to pursue the art of cheese making. Do you like stinky Limburger? It's a Doofenshmirtz family recipe."
1,5,It's not ready yet. It still has to age for 58 and 1/2 years. (Watch ticking) But who's got that kind of time? Which is why I created,The Age Accelerator...Inator.
1,5,Phineas,"Okay, Candace. This is a very important scene. It is nothing less than the emotional backbone of the whole film. Oh, and the villagers are coming at you with everything they've got."
1,5,Candace,"Uh, what do mean the villa-"
1,5,Phineas,Action! The air force!

1,5,Candace,Wow! Is this banana hat for some cool tropical dance number?
1,5,Phineas,We're trying to come up with some exciting camera angles for the big chase scene. So we strapped a camera on to this starving monkey.
1,5,Candace,Aah! Wait! No! (TV static)
1,5,Phineas,"(Laughing) Sorry that monkey cam didn't work out. We're gonna try it with Ferb this time. Now take this sandwich and remember, Ferb hasn't eaten lunch yet. (Ferb imitates the monkey while beginning to charge) Hold on tight."
1,5,Candace,AAH! Wait! NO! (TV static)
1,5,Phineas,"Okay. In this scene, the monster; that's you, gets attacked by 800 cubic feet of rats, spiders, and snakes."
1,5,Candace,There is no way I am doing that!
1,5,Phineas,Relax. They're made out of rubber.
1,5,Candace,(Sighs)
1,5,Phineas,"Well the snakes are rubber, anyway."
1,5,Candace,AAH! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me! Get 'em off me!
1,5,Phineas,"Okay. Candace, this is your beauty shot. The curse has been lifted, and you are no longer a monster. Now this scene, is what the heart wants, but the mind can't have. Take one."

1,5,Candace,"(Weakly) Whether 'tis no- (Sinks, toilets and pipes fall)"
1,5,Phineas,Wrong prop. What the heck. Let's keep it!
1,5,Candace,Oof!

1,5,Candace,"(Panting) ""To think... To dream-"""

(Laser zaps a baby on a playground, turning it into a large hairy adult) Hooray, it worked! And now to make some perfectly aged cheese! (Laser zaps) Ah, perfect! You can actually see the pungent aroma. Here you go, Perry the Platypus. But I'm warning you. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. I'll go get some crackers. We're in luck! I still have some left over Melba Toa-- (gasps in horror) Oh no! The cheese! What happened to the stinky cheese?!"
1,5,Doofenshmitz,"Perry the Platypus, you ate all the cheese?! Noooooo! I created this for peaceful, cheese loving purposes, but now you forced me to wield it in anger! (Laser zaps) Perry the- Perry the Platypus, hold still! Hold still so I can blast you!"

1,5,Phineas,"Well, at least we had fun."
1,5,Candace,Fun? What about me? I was gonna be a star.
1,5,Phineas,"Don't worry, Candace. We saved a copy of your best scenes. We're gonna put it on our website right away."

1,4,Candace,WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MOM'S CAR?!
1,4,Phineas,We tricked it out!
1,4,Candace,You don't even know how to drive.

1,4,Vivian,Oy-vey. Look how tall you are now. You must've grown a couple of inches since the last time I've saw you.
1,4,Candace,"That was last week, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro."

1,4,Isabella,Aren't you gonna need a pit crew?
1,4,Phineas,Do you know a pit crew?
1,4,Isabella,Well...I know a few people who work well together.

1,4,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons completely unknown, he's purchased a giant airship or blimp, as the kids say. Your mission is to find out why, and if necessary, put a stop to it."
1,4,Isabella,"(Dreamily) Hi, Phineas. I got your pit crew."
1,4,Phineas,Cool! See ya in the pits.

1,4,Linda,"What is it, Candace? I'm right in the middle of a 3-No trump."
1,4,Candace,(on a payphone at the race) Turn on the TV!
1,4,Linda,"All right. All right, Candace. This better be good."
1,4,Candace,(from the phone) Well? Well? Do you see it?
1,4,Linda,"Just a second, honey."
1,4,Vivian,Turn on the cable box first.
1,4,Linda,"Hmm. All right. (Presses another remote, ejecting a CD) Wait. 'Kay, that's not it. Um, is it this one? No, this is another phone."
1,4,Candace,"(cringing) Mom, hurry up!"
1,4,Linda,"Okay, just a second! (Presses the right remote)"
1,4,TV Narrator,Are you embarrassed about flaking? Itching? Peeling?
1,4,Linda,"Candace, this is a dandruff commercial. Is there something you're trying to tell me?"
1,4,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. Are we good to go?"
1,4,Rick,"And with the race about to start, there's the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated blimp!"
1,4,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. I'm glad you're here. Actually, I was just getting ready to serve some PLATYPUS UNDER GLASS! You're just in time to witness my latest invention...my Deflate-inator Ray! Which I will demonstrate by deflating the tires of the Jefferson County Motor Speedway! After which, I will deflate everything in the Tri-State Area! That way, if anyone want's anything flated, they will have to talk to me."
1,4,Candace,"Phineas, you are in big trouble, mister--! (Cars zoom past her, leaving her burnt)"
1,4,Jeremy,"Candace, you got a little..."
1,4,Photographer,(takes picture) Smile! Souvenir picture? Only a dollar.

1,4,Candace,"Oh, yeah, uh, I've only got a dollar, but uh, I just want the one. You can just tear the other one up, 'kay?(The photographer rips one picture)"

1,4,Rick,"And on the fast on the inside lane is Number 42, Team Phineas!"
1,4,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. Do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery. But I was thinking: Let's open it up and see what this puppy can- (Classic car honking) Uh, Ferb? We're actually slowing down now. Ferb? Hello? (Car speeds up) OH YEAH! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT!"
1,4,Isabella,"Hey, Ferb. We should bring Phineas in for a pit stop. All right, Fireside Girls, let's move, move, move!"

1,4,Doofenshmirtz,"Already they fear me, listen to their screams, huh? Imagine the mayhem once my Deflate-inator ray is fully charged. (at the mouse in the machine) Run! Run like the wind, my little indentured rodent. And I will give you some cheese. Heh, I know I had some around here somewhere."
1,4,Doofenshmirtz,I think there's some- There used to be some Roquefort around the back here. I don't...
1,4,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm? AYYY! AY-AY-AY-AYYY! (Glass breaks) Agh! Oof! (Laser fires, Blimp deflating) Hmm. I suppose I should've seen that coming."

1,37,Mad scientist,"You know what we're going to do today, Talbo? It's time to test...THE TELEPORT! (Flips a switch, causing the teleports to activate. Talbo teleports to the one to the right, only get to singed.) Eureka! Now I can teleport myself anywhere in the world!"
1,37,Talbo,"Wouldn't you have to take one of those teleport things there first? Oh, but then you'd already be there. It kinda renders the whole thing redundant, doesn't it?"
1,37,Mad scientist,"Do you want me to remove your tongue again, Talbo?"
1,37,Phineas,"Cool! (turns off TV with the remote) I know what we can do today, Ferb. (chuckles while Ferb covers his mouth with his hands) No, not the tongue thing. The teleporter."
1,37,Linda,"(off screen) Hey, boys."
1,37,Phineas,"Hey, Mom. Ferb and I are gonna build a teleport device."
1,37,Linda,"(oblivious) Oh, great. I wish to teleport to where my earrings are. I've lost them."
1,37,Phineas,The dangly smoky topaz or the hoops?
1,37,Linda,Hoops.
1,37,Phineas,"Oh, she must be wearing the blue dress. We'll keep an eye out for 'em. (at Ferb) Come on, Ferb. We're burnin' daylight."
1,37,Phineas,"Teleports completed! .... Hey, where's Perry?"
1,37,Candace,(sniffs) (record scratch) Ew!
1,37,Candace,Mom! Do you know where Phineas and Ferb are?
1,37,Linda,"They're in the garage, honey."
1,37,Candace,"Oh, by the way, Jeremy's gonna be here soon. Please try not to embarrass me in front of him again."
1,37,Linda,"What do you mean, again?"
1,37,Candace,Remember my fifth-grade graduation with the inflatable–
1,37,Linda,"Oh, that's right. My bad."
1,37,Phineas,This is a glorious day for mankind. Ready with the camera so we can document it?
1,37,Phineas,Cheese!
1,37,Candace,How many times have I told you to keep Perry out of my room?! (notices the teleports) What are those?
1,37,Phineas,"Teleports. Pretty cool, huh?"
1,37,Candace,"You guys are so bus – Aah! (trips on a controller, disappears through one teleport, and appears from the other)"
1,37,Phineas,Cool. It worked. (suddenly looks concerned) Candace? Are you OK?
1,37,{Editor's Note,"Until Perry and Candace switches back, this transcript refers Perry in Candace's body as Perry/Candace and Candace in Perry's body as Candace/Perry.}"
1,37,Candace/Perry,"(pointing at her brothers) Wait a second. How you guys get so big? (gasps) And why is my hand green? (takes a pink mirror from a nearby box) AHHHHHHH!!! I'M AN UGLY, SMELLY PLATYPUS!!! I'm a platypus! I'm a platypus! I'm a platypus! I'm a platypus!"
1,37,Phineas,(talking over) Amazing. You and Perry going through the teleport at the same time must have switched your brains.
1,37,Candace/Perry,"Oh, you think? You guys better change me back now or I'll... Wait...JEREMY'S GONNA BE HERE SOON!"
1,37,Phineas,"Not a problem, sis. We'll just put you both through the teleporter again. Hey, where's Perry? Uh, I-I mean Candace. I mean Perry in Candace's body."
1,37,Phineas,"I wonder where he scampered off to. Any ideas, Ferb?"
1,37,Isabella,What'cha dooooin'?
1,37,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella. We built a teleportation device and accidentally switched Candace and Perry's brains."
1,37,Isabella,Really? That's so cool!
1,37,Candace/Perry,You wouldn't think it was so cool if you smelled like this.
1,37,Phineas,We're looking for Perry so we can switch them back to normal. Wanna help?

1,37,Jeremy,"Hey, Mrs. Flynn. Is Candace here?"
1,37,Linda,"Oh, she's still getting ready. You know girls. Have a seat. While you wait, I'll make you a snack."
1,37,Jeremy,"Oh, hey, Perry. Come up here. How's my favorite little platypus today?"
1,37,Candace/Perry,Oh hee- hee- hee- hee I mean... (tries to imitate Perry's chatter)
1,37,Crowd,"(reading the billboard) ""Lost platypus. Looks like a girl."" You know, that's insulting to the platypus. How are we supposed to tell if it's a girl?"
1,37,Linda,"Why don't you watch some TV while you wait? Oh, hey. I've got some great baby movies of Candace."
1,37,Linda,Ohh! There she is in the bathtub. (bubbles gurgle) Oops! Little bubbles.
1,37,Candace/Perry,(off screen) Mom! Remember what we talked about? My fifth-grade graduation?
1,37,Linda,Fifth-grade graduation? What is she talking about?

Gets hit with Perry/Candace's shoulder bag) Oof! Did you have that purse when you came in? .... Well, I'm out of here. .... (Speeds away, leaving a smoke statue, which dissipates, revealing Doofenshmirtz)"
1,37,Linda,"You're such a nice boy, Jeremy. I can why Candace built a shrine of you in her room. (laughs) Oopsy! I probably should've not said that. Thanks for feeding Perry while I look for my earrings."
1,37,Jeremy,"Sure, no problem. .... What's in this platypus food, anyway?"
1,37,Linda,"Mostly worms and insect larvae. (Candace/Perry starts to barf then Linda puts her outside) Oh, Perry! Now I have to get the carpet cleaned again! Hey, maybe I lost my earrings while folding Candace's laundry. Why don't you help me look while you wait, Jeremy?"
1,37,Candace/Perry,Am I sweating milk?! Being a platypus is so gross!
1,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, wait! I can't-I can't fight when you're dressed as a girl. It's so...como se dice... awkward. .... Look! Shoes on sale! .... Curse you, Perry the teenager!"

1,37,Candace/Perry,Great. Change me back now!
1,37,Phineas,"So this is how you went through the first time, right? You were holding Perry?"
1,37,Candace/Perry,"(Holding Perry/Candace) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hurry! Oh! He's a lot heavier now."
1,37,Phineas,I wonder if it worked.
1,37,Candace,You guys are so busted! I'm telling Mom! (she leaves)
1,37,Ferb,You might consider bathing first.
1,37,Doofenshmirtz,"I gotta get out of this! (Hits a button on the panel of a machine, it fires) Gah! Oh, dear. My old Shrinkinator. (sighs) I suppose I should've unplugged it before I turned it into a planter."
1,37,Candace,"(comes into the garage with an evil look on her face) Come on, Mom, hurry up! (at Phineas and Ferb) You're busted."
1,37,Candace,(With her eyes closed) See?! see?! It's right there!!
1,37,Linda,"Oh, my goodness!"
1,37,Phineas,Uh... yeah.
1,37,Linda,(gasps) These are so much nicer than the ones I lost!
1,37,Phineas,Awesome.

1,44,Phineas,A meteor shower? How cool is that? Just think: somewhere out in space there's a bunch of asteroids headed right for Earth!
1,44,Lawrence,"Hey, boys? Boys? Oh there you are! Hey, look what I got for you online!"
1,44,Phineas,"Oh, cool! You named a star after us!"
1,44,Lawrence,You're now the owners of a little piece of the universe!
1,44,Phineas,Did you get one for Candace too?
1,44,Lawrence,"Well, I did. Yes, of course I did, although she doesn't really care about this stuff. Anyway, they're practically giving 'em away online! D'you know, it's even better than the Oklahoma land rush of 1889!"
1,44,Linda,"Ah, those corny history references made me fall for him in the first place. Vivian and I are off to our mahjong tournament. Have fun today, boys."
1,44,Lawrence,"Okay, darling. Good luck."
1,44,Phineas,Good luck!
1,44,Lawrence,"Well, what am I doing standing here when I can be out buying more stars?"
1,44,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. Now that we own a star, we should go check it out! And how cool is space travel? The g-forces, eating dinner out of a tube, going to the bathroom without going to the bathroom, not to mention the weightlessness. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
1,44,Candace,"Uh, Jeremy, I was wondering, uh... if you'd like to go the Night of the Falling Stars Girls-Choice Dance with me."
1,44,Jeremy,With you? You've got to be kidding me. (He begins laughing)
1,44,Candace,"(Talking on the phone) And that, Stacy, is why I can't ask Jeremy to the dance."
1,44,Stacy,"You realize that's kind of a worse-case scenario, right?"
1,44,Candace,That could very well happen. What if he says no? What if he laughs in my face?
1,44,Stacy,"You can't let fear rule your life, Candace. Jeremy likes you. He's not gonna say no. Now, I'm gonna hang up, and when I do, I want you to call Jeremy. Don't man the phone, girl. Phone the man!"
1,44,Candace,"Yeah, I am not gonna let fear rule my life. (Dials number)"

1,44,Isabella,Sure. No prob.
1,44,Isabella,Why are you guys walking so slow?
1,44,Phineas,Dramatic effect.

1,44,Candace,"(Climbing into Phineas and Ferb's spaceship) Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and other things to worry about. Every single day, it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing– (She enters the cockpit, to find Phineas and Ferb aren't there)"
1,44,Phineas,Got the remote?
1,44,Phineas,Oops.

1,44,Phineas,Candace? How'd you get in there?
1,44,Candace,(Yelling) I can't hear you! My cheeks are covering my ears!
1,44,Phineas,We should probably help her. Good thing we built two rockets.
1,44,Isabella,"Wow, it's pretty."
1,44,Phineas,It was for Candace to see her star. I don't know why she took ours.
1,44,Astronaut,"(In a space shuttle, preparing to dock with the space station) Uh, ready to park this puppy?"
1,44,Astronaut,"Oh, it's bad enough this happens on earth. Now space?!"

1,44,Candace,I can't hear you! I'm too busy hitting buttons randomly!

1,44,Candace,I don't know. He must've gotten off before we launched.
1,44,Major Monogram,"Agent P, afraid I have terrible news. It's Doofenshmirtz. He's built a space station, and due to budget cuts, we have no way of getting you into space. Now, I've contacted the president, and... Agent P, are you in space? Nice work. You are always one step ahead. Your mission is to find Doofenshmirtz and stop him, Agent P."
1,44,Monogram,(Floating in space) Agent P? Agent P?
1,44,Candace,"Uh, guys, what are all these red flashing things heading toward my rocket?"
1,44,Phineas,"Yeah, those are asteroids."
1,44,Candace,Asteroids? (She screams)
1,44,Phineas,Just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We're catching up to her!
1,44,Phineas,"Oop, she lost her engines. Let's go get her."
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"I can't believe it's Perry the Platypus. (He traps Perry in an ice cube tray) Hohohohoho Perry the Platypus, what are you doing here? I thought you guys were having budget cuts. Well, it just shows to go ya. Hey, let's walk and talk. So, you're probably wondering why my space station has two enormous arms. Well, what you should be wondering is why it has two giant hands! Ha ha ha ha!"
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"(Flashing back) See, during my teen years, I was very adept at hand shadows. It was great for entertaining at parties, and for meeting Fräuleins. But then one day, there was a new puppeteer in town. His name was Hans, and his hands were huge. We called him ""Huge Hands Hans"". His puppetry was garbage, but unfortunately, it was good enough for my Fräulein. I lost her to a boy with bigger fingers, and I never did a shadow puppet again."
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"Until tonight! (He laughs) And when the sun rises in one hour; see, right over there; Then everyone in the Tri-State Area will see my enormous hand shadows on the moon!"
1,44,Phineas,"There she is! Uh-oh, this isn't good. Candace, you're in a decaying orbit."
1,44,Candace,What does that even mean?
1,44,Phineas,You just need to get to the spacesuit on the hook behind you.
1,44,Candace,Okay.
1,44,Phineas,Now put it on.
1,44,Candace,"Okay, I'm putting it on."
1,44,Phineas,Now walk over to the door.
1,44,Candace,"Okay, I'm at the door."
1,44,Phineas,Now just open it and take a little spacewalk to our ship.
1,44,Candace,What?
1,44,Phineas,"Candace, there's nothing to be scared of."
1,44,Candace,"Nothing to be scared of? There's the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space!"
1,44,Phineas,I hear negative!
1,44,Candace,There is no way I'm going out there.
1,44,Phineas,We're just a few yards away. You can't let fear rule your life.
1,44,Candace,Of course I can. That's my thing.
1,44,Phineas,"Candace, just calm down and take Ferb's hand."
1,44,Candace,"Ferb's hand? (Ferb grabs her hand, and leaves Candace's ship, dragging Candace along, back to Phineas's ship) Thanks, guys."
1,44,Phineas,"Mission Control? Come in, Mission Control."
1,44,Isabella,"Phineas, did you find Candace?"
1,44,Phineas,"Yes. We've got her, and we're on our way home."
1,44,Isabella,"Excellent. So, Phineas, speaking of home, there's that dance tonight, and– (An alarm begins beeping)"
1,44,Phineas,"Hold that thought, Isabella. I think we're out of fuel."
1,44,Candace,What? Find some fuel somewhere and let's go.
1,44,Phineas,That's gonna be hard. We're kinda nowhere.
1,44,Candace,You mean we're stuck here in the empty void of space?
1,44,Candace,Phineas... what is that?
1,44,Phineas,I have no idea.
1,44,Astronaut,"Uh, will the owner of a red station wagon please move your vehicle? You are in a shuttle loading and unloading zone only."
1,44,Candace,What is that?
1,44,Phineas,"I have no idea. (reading the signs that was emitting the light) Milk shakes? Wow, that was so bright, I thought it was a star. Maybe we'll find some fuel here. (The rocket lands) Are you sure you don't wanna come with us? Ferb says the oxygen levels are just like Earth."
1,44,Candace,"Uh... I'm sure. Just find some fuel, and let's get out of here!"
1,44,Bartender,One sarsaparilla coming up.
1,44,Alien,"I love you, man."
1,44,Phineas,"Hi. I'm Phineas, and this is Ferb."
1,44,Bartender,Wait a second. You're Phineas and Ferb?
1,44,Phineas,Yeah.
1,44,Bartender,"Hey, everyone, it's the new owners!"
1,44,Phineas,"New owners? Those coordinates are right here. Ferb, this is our star. Wow. That sign really is bright."
1,44,Alien 2,I told you they'd show up.
1,44,Bartender,"So now that you own the joint, what do you think of it? I know, it's a little run-down."
1,44,Phineas,I have a few ideas for this place.
1,44,Isabella,"You do realize that's a worst-case scenario, right, Candace? But I do feel for ya. I've been trying to ask Phineas to that same dance all–"
1,44,Candace,"Phineas. What's taking those boys so long? They were supposed to find fuel ages ago. Later, Isabella."
1,44,Isabella,Sure. No prob.
1,44,Doorman,(In a Cockney accent) Stop right there.
1,44,Candace,"Let me in, buster."
1,44,Doorman,Phineas and Ferb don't take kindly to gatecrashers.
1,44,Candace,I'm no gatecrasher; I'm their sister!
1,44,Doorman,"Ooh, sorry about that. Honest mistake. You won't mention this to them, eh?"
1,44,Alien 3,"Uh, I'm their sister."
1,44,(Song,"""Shooting Star Milkshake Bar"")"
1,44,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, guess what? This is our star!"
1,44,Candace,I thought we were getting out of here.
1,44,Phineas,"Ferb and I thought we'd fix up the place. You know, pride of ownership? Take a load off. Have a shake."
1,44,Alien 4,I can't do it.
1,44,Candace,"Uh, are you okay?"
1,44,Alien 4,"No. The bicentennial Taming of the Yarks Dance is tonight, and I wanna ask the girl of my dreams, but what if she says no? What if she laughs in my face? What if her friends laugh at me? What if her friends' friends laugh at me?"
1,44,Candace,"Aren't you being a little overly dramatic? I mean, really, what's the worst thing that could happen?"
1,44,Alien 4,Uh... the entire planet could blow up?
1,44,Candace,Please. I think you should just ask her to the dance.
1,44,Alien 4,Really? You think so?
1,44,Candace,I do. Really.
1,44,Alien 4,Well... Okay. (He takes a breath) Here goes nothin'. Ahem. Sylvia... will you go to the dance with me?
1,44,Sylvia,"(Appearing, attached to his head) Well, of course. I've been waiting for you to ask me. I mean, even if you asked someone else, I'd still have to go with you."
1,44,Candace,See? That wasn't so hard.
1,44,Phineas,So... Candace?
1,44,Candace,"Oh, I get it. Big lesson. Yeah, well, I learned that it wouldn't be hard to ask Jeremy out if he was growing out of the back of my head. Now you find us some fuel, and let's get outta here."
1,44,Phineas,"Wow. I just wanted to know if she liked the shake. (to the bartender) You don't know where we could find some rocket fuel, do ya?"
1,44,Bartender,Rocket fuel? It's all Ronaldo drinks.
1,44,Ronaldo,(In an Italian accent) Only imported rocket fuel.
1,44,Ronaldo,Grazie.
1,44,Candace,Let's go!
1,44,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, I'm sensing Candace wants to leave."
1,44,Candace,Will you cut that out?
1,44,Astronaut,"Okay, that's it. I'm not waiting anymore. (The two astronauts lift the car away) Great. Let's park the shuttle. (A flying saucer lands) Oh, come on! (He throws his helmet off in fury, and quickly puffs up because of it) Uh-oh. I think I should go inside now."
1,44,Candace,Why are we stopping?
1,44,Phineas,"I don't get it. We have plenty of fuel. The battery's worn down. Candace, were you using the videophone without the engine running?"
1,44,Candace,Yeah. Was that a bad thing?
1,44,Phineas,"If by ""bad"", you mean we're stranded in the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space... then, yeah."
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"Soon, Perry the Platypus, the sun will be at full strength, and my plan will come to fruition. Unless, of course, it's overcast... (An alarm begins beeping) Eh, but what are you going to do? Proximity alert? Why are there so many people in space? What's up with that?"
1,44,Isabella,"You need another jump-start? Candace, didn't you have the engine running when we were talking on the videophone?"
1,44,Candace,Am I the only person who doesn't know this?
1,44,Phineas,"So, any suggestions, Isabella?"
1,44,Isabella,Sensors are indicating a massive power source in your area.
1,44,Phineas,"Where? I don't see it. (Doofenshmirtz's ship rises behind Phineas, Ferb, and Candace's) Wait a minute. I see it. It's Mom's car! We're saved! Ferb, toss me the starter remote. (Ferb shrugs) Ooh, that's right. We left it at home."
1,44,Candace,What's a starter remote?
1,44,Phineas,"Well, legally we're too young to start a car. We get away with it by using a starter remote. But you, Candace, have your learner's permit. Looks like you'll be doing the jump-starting."
1,44,Candace,"What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Can't you guys just find some old nuts and bolts lying around and jerry-rig up some kind of machiney-deely-bob and get us out of this situation?"
1,44,Ferb,"Candace, we are just kids."
1,44,Candace,( She groans) Why am I arguing this? Hand me the suit.
1,44,Phineas,Let me turn on the oxygen.
1,44,Candace,Does this suit make my butt look big?
1,44,Phineas,"Yes. Yes, it does. Maybe I had the pressure up too high."
1,44,Candace,"Never mind. I'll fix it. (She backs up, and transfers the inflation to her hands) Well, I guess this is preferable."
1,44,Phineas,"You can do this, Candace."
1,44,Candace,I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can't do this. I can't do this.
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"(Watching) What is this? Now, why would an astronaut wear such big gloves? Wait a second! (He gasps) Huge Hands Hans?! It's Huge Hands Hans! He found me out in space! Oh, you're not going to steal a job from me this time, Huge Hands Hans! Nor my Fräuleins!"
1,44,Candace,"How did it go again, Phineas?"
1,44,Phineas,It's positive to positive.
1,44,Candace,Positive to positive.
1,44,Phineas,Negative to ground.
1,44,Candace,What ground? We're in space!
1,44,Phineas,"No, no. Ground just means any piece of metal."
1,44,Candace,"Any piece of metal? Well, then why do they call it ground? Why don't they just call it me- (She turns around and sees Doofenshimrtz's spaceship reaching to grab her)"
1,44,Phineas,"What's wrong, Candace? Candace? Candace, what's wro- (Phineas sees the ship as well) Oh. Danville, we have a problem."
1,44,Isabella,"Okay, girls, turn to the giant robot section of your Fireside Girls manuals."
1,44,Phineas,"Isabella, anything?"
1,44,Isabella,Still looking.
1,44,Phineas,Isabella!
1,44,Isabella,"Here it is. Okay. According to this, you should get the heck out of there!"
1,44,Phineas,"Great, but we've got no power. She didn't connect the— Candace, negative to ground!"
1,44,Candace,What?
1,44,Phineas,"Negative to ground, Candace! Negative to ground!"
1,44,Candace,"Oh, you mean negative to metal! (She attaches the jump lead to the robot, thereby giving the rocket a jumpstart) I did it! I did it!"
1,44,Phineas,She did it!
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"No! Huge Hands Hans is getting away! Not this time, freak fingers!"
1,44,Phineas,"Isabella, I hate to bother you again."
1,44,Isabella,"Oh, no bother."
1,44,Phineas,You got anything else? The robot's gaining on us.
1,44,Isabella,It says they don't corner well.
1,44,Phineas,"They don't corner well? Wait a sec. Candace, fasten your seat belt. We're taking a little detour. (They steer the spaceship into the asteroid belt, swing Candace around) Now, how is she passing us?"
1,44,Candace,"Phineas, what are you doing?! (She screams)"
1,44,Phineas,See? Corners like a dream.
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"That's it! Run away, Perry the Scaredy– Oof. (With his face puffed up from exposure to the vacuum of space) Oh, I think I need to put on my spacesuit. Uh oh."
1,44,Lawrence,"And now, my good man, you ready for this? Your tip. Your very own star."
1,44,Delivery Guy,"Uptown, they give quasars. (He drives off)"
1,44,Candace,"Oh, sweet land!"
1,44,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas, you guys were great."
1,44,Phineas,Thanks. You weren't too bad yourself.
1,44,Isabella,"Oh. (She giggles) Thanks. So, would you like to go to the Night of the Falling Stars Girls' Choice Dance tonight?"
1,44,Phineas,Sounds like fun.
1,44,Isabella,Really?
1,44,Phineas,"Ferb, what's our schedule like?"
1,44,Phineas,"Okay, we'll be there."
1,44,Isabella,Both of you?
1,44,Phineas,"Yeah. Why don't you come by, and we'll all walk over together?"
1,44,Isabella,Sure. No prob.
1,44,Linda,"Thanks for the lift, Viv."
1,44,Candace,(Stares at her rocket ship and walks up to Linda) Mom!
1,44,Linda,"Hey, sweetheart. Oh, look at your outfit. Hey, guess what? We won! (flatly) But the grand prize was a star."
1,44,Lawrence,"(eating pizza) Ooh, whoo!"
1,44,Candace,"(smiles) Mom, that's great, but you gotta see something in the yard. Come on, you gotta see it! Come on, come on!"
1,44,Linda,"All right, I'm a-comin'."
1,44,Linda,"Hmm. Uh, I'll be right with you after I pull my car into the garage."
1,44,Candace,"Yes, it's still here! (to Linda) See, Mom? There! Mom?"
1,44,Linda,I'm just backing the car in! I'll be right with you!
1,44,Linda,"So what did you want to show me, Candace?"
1,44,Candace,(facepalms) Just go make some pie...
1,44,Linda,Or... (leaving) How about a healthy fruit salad?
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, curse this tin can! Ugh, I'm going to need a jump-start! (Phineas and Ferb;s rocket crashes into Doofenshmirtz's, causing it to begin to fall towards earth) I, uh, no, I guess it won't help now."
1,44,Phineas,"Hey, Candace?"
1,44,Candace,What?
1,44,Phineas,"Ferb and I just wanted to say thank you. We were in a pretty precarious situation up there. If it wasn't for your bravery, who knows what would have happened?"
1,44,Candace,Really? You think I'm... brave?
1,44,Phineas,Are you kidding? Ferb was goin' on and on about it.
1,44,Candace,"Yeah, I was brave! (She gasps) I was brave! I'm not gonna let fear rule my life anymore! Now I've gotta go. I've got a mission to accomplish."
1,44,Phineas,"Hey, Perry. Where ya been?"
1,44,Candace,"Jeremy, will you go to the dance with me?"
1,44,Jeremy,Candace?
1,44,Candace,(Reveals she's in her spacesuit) Yeah.
1,44,Jeremy,I've been waiting for you to ask me.
1,44,Candace,Really?
1,44,Jeremy,"Yeah. Only, uh, uh, Candace, is that what you're gonna wear?"
1,44,Candace,Why? You like it?
1,44,(Song,Let's Take a Rocket Ship to Space)
1,44,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace, look."
1,44,Candace,"A shooting star, just for us."
1,44,Doofenshmirtz,"(Screaming) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And you too, Huge Hands Hans!"
1,44,Voice,"It's the final frontier, baby."
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb."
1,45,Phineas,Have you seen bolt #473?
1,45,Candace,"Okay, it's still here. Oh, come on, Mom! We're really coming down to the wire on this one."
1,45,Linda,"Thanks, Vivian. See you Tuesday for totem pole carving."
1,45,Candace,"Mom! Mom! Quick, Mom, look! Before it disappears!"
1,45,Linda,"Well, if it isn't the welcoming committee. -"
1,45,Candace,"No time for dry, witty remarks! Must move. Move, move, move, move! Move, move, move, move!"
1,45,Linda,Don't you get tired of this?
1,45,Candace,What do you mean?
1,45,Linda,"The same old routine every day. Doesn't it ever get--"" mm, I don't know-- boring?"
1,45,Candace,"...You know what? You're right. I guess it has gotten a little old. I just get so frustrated. I always come so close to busting Phineas and Ferb, but it ends the same way every single time. I look and say there's a massive ""thing"" Phineas and Ferb built right in front of me, but every time you look, you always say..."
1,45,Linda,I...see it.
1,45,Candace,"There it is. ""I see it."" Right on you. Wait, what? Come again?"
1,45,Linda,I see it!
1,45,Candace,You mean you see my point?
1,45,Linda,"No, Candace. I see that! (she points at the tower)"
1,45,Candace,(Gasps) You do?!
1,45,Linda,How could I miss it? But I don't understand. How the...? Or who the...? B-- What the?
1,45,Phineas,"Hi, Mom! Check it out! The Flying Car of the Future; Today!"
1,45,Linda,Is that my...car?!
1,45,Candace,"(Ecstatic) She sees the car, too!"
1,45,Phineas,"(To Ferb) The Flying Car of the Future; Today, is still pulling a bit to the right."
1,45,Linda,(In the distance) PHINEAS! FERB! GET DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!!!
1,45,Phineas,"Okay, Mom, be right down."
1,45,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry. (To Linda) So, what do you think, Mom? Pretty cool, huh?"
1,45,Linda,Cool?! This is the most dangerous thing I've ever seen!!
1,45,Phineas,"Don't worry, we were safe. Ferb invented a new invisible helmet head system. (He and Ferb take off hats that look like their normal heads) ""When life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull."""
1,45,Linda,How dare you do all this without permission!
1,45,Phineas,But all our building permits are in order.
1,45,Linda,"I mean, my permission."
1,45,Phineas,This morning I asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.
1,45,Linda,"I was talking about your toy car!! How could you possibly think I meant my station wagon?! You are in SO much trouble, young man!!!"
1,45,Phineas,But...we do this sort of thing every day.
1,45,Linda,(Her anger now replaced with shock) What?!!
1,45,Candace,"(Sounding a bit smug) See, Mom? I told you...but you never listened."
1,45,Linda,But I...
1,45,Memory-Candaces,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster! Phineas and Ferb are one-hit wonders? Phineas and Ferb carved my face into Mount Rushmore. Phineas and Ferb are driving cattle. Phineas and Ferb built a giant tree house robot... (The next several begin to slur together as they quickly come to her) are promoting a boxing match...built a beach in the backyard...built a time machine... built a ski resort! Are directing a movie... built a haunted house... built a giant sundae maker... are getting the band back together... Phineas and Ferb are in my large intestine!"
1,45,Linda,"Oh, Candace. All the times I called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back, all those journals I've filled with an eye towards stand-up comedy...but you were telling the truth! I'm so sorry. You're the best daughter any mother could dream of having."
1,45,Candace,"Finally, you realize that!"
1,45,Lawrence,"Well, what's all this yelling about? (Notices the tower) Oh, my word! That is impressive."
1,45,Linda,Did you know about this?
1,45,Lawrence,"Well, I -- I...I -- I, uh...no."
1,45,Candace,(Clearly overjoyed) What are you gonna do to them? No TV for a month? Or -- they have to serve me for a year. (gasps) How about confiscating their toolbox? (gasps) I know! Take away their seats on the city council!
1,45,Linda,You have seats on the city council?
1,45,Phineas,We rotate out with the Board of Selectmen.
1,45,Lawrence,"Well, some punishment may be in order, but, look, there's no harm done really."
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, look, Ferb, here's bolt number 473. I hope that wasn't important."
1,45,Phineas,"Well, at least the self-parking works."
1,45,Candace,(Grinning widely) Ee-ee-ee-ee!
1,45,Linda,"I'm sorry, but this is really for your own good. We need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous. I'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt."
1,45,Phineas,We were wearing helmets. (A sergeant walks behind the bus then holds a Smile Away Reformatory School brochure with an image of a sun on it.)
1,45,Sergeant,"Don't worry. Your boys will be in good hands. As you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the Smile Away Reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged. Your boys will be whipped into shape in no time."
1,45,Phineas,"Well, I'll be honest, Ferb, I didn't see this coming. (Notices Baljeet is on the bus too) Baljeet? What are you doing here?"
1,45,Baljeet,"Well, I got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high. But then I heard about this place. Sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but school is school."
1,45,Lawrence,"Bye, boys. See you at the end of summer!"
1,45,Candace,"Yes, I actually busted Phineas and Ferb! (sighs) This is the happiest moment of my life! Woo-hoo! (Candace acts like an acrobat. Elsewhere in the sky, she skydives with two teenagers, soaring pass a meadow.) I'm finally free!"
1,45,(Song,"""The Good Life"")"
1,45,Phineas,That doesn't look like the brochure.
1,45,Baljeet,"I was too excited to wait. (Takes off his wig) I shaved last night. Just call me Bald-jeet. Heh-heh. Get it? ""Bald-jeet""?"
1,45,Sergeant,"Okay, listen up, maggots! You are here because your parents (Mockingly) are worried about you. Now, the way I see it, the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination, fun, creativity and unbridled enthusiasm! Don't you eyeball me! Our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure, order, discipline and conformity."
1,45,Sergeant,What--? (he looks over to see Phineas and Ferb doing something to their bunk bed) Whatcha doin'?
1,45,Phineas,"Oh, a few simple modifications. We call it the ""Ferris bed."" It makes trading off fair, simple and fun...(♪ carousel music) ...as well as giving easy access to the top bunk. All at the push of a button. Pretty cool, huh?"
1,45,Phineas,"You know, this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom."
1,45,Sergeant,"That's the idea! Now, make it shine!"
1,45,Sergeant,And no funky rhythms! (Leaves)
1,45,Phineas,"I thought it had more of a free-form jazz vibe. Huh. Well, you can't please everybody."
1,45,Candace,Oh! Ow-ow!
1,45,Stacy,What did you do?
1,45,Candace,I tripped over Ferb's old toolbox.
1,45,Stacy,"Well, do you wanna go horseback riding?"
1,45,Candace,"What's your hurry? Let's relax for a little while. You know, with Phineas and Ferb gone, I've had a blast doing things I wanted to do. But it's strange. I kind of miss the little guys. It's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that I never noticed before."
1,45,(Song,"""Little Brothers"")"
1,45,Candace,"Uh, Stace, you're kind of bumming me out with the song there."
1,45,Stacy,"You know, you finally have everything you ever wanted. Call me when you get over it. (leaves)"
1,45,Candace,Ok. Maybe a little TV will take my mind off things. (turns on the TV)
1,45,Morty Williams,"Today on ""The Morty Williams Show,"" ""My Kid Is Bad, and I Want to Blame Others!"" We'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school, where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. They are forced to think inside the box."
1,45,Candace,Wait a second. They didn't belong in a place like that. I know what I have to do.
1,45,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
1,45,Candace,Jeremy? How did you get in here?
1,45,Jeremy,There's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house.
1,45,Candace,"Oh, yeah, well, Phineas and Ferb would've usually fixed that by now."
1,45,Jeremy,You wanna go horseback riding?
1,45,Candace,Would you stop already with the horses? Jeremy! I know what I'm gonna do today! I'm gonna bust my brothers...
1,45,Jeremy,Didn't you already do that?
1,45,Candace,Out! Bust my brothers out!
1,45,Jeremy,Cool. I always liked your brothers. I'm coming with you.
1,45,Candace,"(gasps) You mean, like a date?"
1,45,Jeremy,Yeah. A weird sort of prison-break kind of date.
1,45,Recorded female voice,Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. Creative acts are imitable and dangerous. Using your imagination is morally wrong.
1,45,Baljeet,The book was so much better.
1,45,Linda,"Hmm. It's a letter from the board of selectmen. The city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter, and they need Phineas and Ferb's input."
1,45,Lawrence,(sighs) Perhaps we were a bit hard on them.
1,45,Linda,"Yeah, they really did believe they had permission. I suppose it was all a big misunderstanding."
1,45,Lawrence,"Well, let's go get 'em, shall we? We can take the Flying Car of the Future...Today."
1,45,Linda,Weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal?
1,45,Lawrence,"Yes, yes, but you must admit, it's pretty cool!"
1,45,Linda,"Yeah, it's pretty cool."
1,45,Lawrence,"Hey, where's the Flying Car of the Future...Today?"
1,45,Candace,Agh! Sorry. The Flying Car of the Future...Today is pulling a bit to the right.
1,45,Jeremy,Are you kidding? This is the best date ever.
1,45,Candace,(screaming laugh) Whoa-oa-oa!
1,45,Jeremy,Maybe we should walk the rest of the way.
1,45,(Song,"""Chains on Me"")"
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. (starts to reach for the tools)"
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts them with water) No.
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, I know what we're... gonna do..."
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,Hey...
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,...Ferb...
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,...I...
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,...uh...
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,...know...
1,45,Sergeant,(Squirts) No.
1,45,Phineas,...what...
1,45,Sergeant,"(Squirts) No, no, no, no, no!"
1,45,Phineas,"(shivering) Hey, F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F..."
1,45,Sergeant,(laughs) Yes. I've finally broken them.
1,45,Jeremy,"You okay, Candace?"
1,45,Candace,"No, I'm trudging. I never knew people actually trudged."
1,45,Jeremy,"Look, we're here."
1,45,Sergeant,What do you want?
1,45,Candace,"Um...uh, hi. Yeah, I'm here to see my brothers, Phineas and Ferb."
1,45,Sergeant,They don't graduate till the end of the summer. Get lost.
1,45,Candace,So much for the direct approach. It's time we tried it Phineas and Ferb style.
1,45,Jeremy,Is this gonna work?
1,45,Candace,"It's just like the Trojan horse from history class. They'll accept this as a gift, then after everyone falls asleep, we'll jump out and rescue Phineas and Ferb."
1,45,Sergeant,You two again? I thought I told you to get lost!
1,45,Candace,Maybe we gotta think bigger.
1,45,Sergeant,"Wow, what a thoughtful gift. Too bad I don't have room for you, handsome. I'm gonna have to get a bigger yard."
1,45,Candace,(whispers) Now's our chance.
1,45,Jeremy,"Yes, we did i--"
1,45,Candace,"Oh, what is this, hair? Gross! I bet you regret coming along with me now, huh?"
1,45,Jeremy,"Actually, I'm kinda havin' fun. You know, crazy, prison-break kinda fun."
1,45,Candace,"And, ew! Look at this. ""Baljeet's summer wig. Store at room temperature""? Huh? The Morty Williams Show? Wait a second. I've got a plan. It's foolproof."
1,45,Candace,"(deep voice) Yes. Clearly I'm Morty Williams, and I'm back to do another segment."
1,45,Sergeant,"Hey, aren't you a little...female to be Morty Williams?"
1,45,Candace,"Uh, well, you know what they say. The camera adds...masculinity."
1,45,Sergeant,"Great. Well, come on in, Morty."
1,45,Candace,We're doing a follow-up show on Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher.
1,45,Sergeant,"My biggest success stories. Right this way. Ah, Phineas and Ferb. Such curious and self-reliant children. So fun-loving, imaginative and creative. Fortunately, we got to them just in time. See for yourself. (to Phineas and Ferb) Flynn, Fletcher, fall in! (Phineas and Ferb come out of lockers, to Candace) You see, here at the Smile Away Reformatory, our motto is, ""It's structure, order and discipline today, so tomorrow it's Smile Away."" Our methods have been proven 100% effective since... (continues under)"
1,45,Candace,"(whispers) Guys, it's me, Candace. We've come to bust you out of here. Now's our chance. RUN! (to Sergeant) Just testing. Wow, you've done a great job of turning them into, uh...that."
1,45,Sergeant,"Yes. Yes, we have."
1,45,Candace,"Uh, yeah, I-I think we should really get some more footage of you."
1,45,Sergeant,"Oh, really?"
1,45,Candace,"Oh, yeah. You've got...""it,"" mister. So, uh, let's see. Uh, close your eyes."
1,45,Sergeant,"Uh, like this?"
1,45,Candace,"Yes! Now stick your fingers in your ears. Perfect. Now go, ""La la la la la la la la la!"""
1,45,Sergeant,"Well, okay. ♪ La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la. ♪"
1,45,Candace,"The lights are all wrong. Go inside the janitor's closet. (Sergeant's singing continues) And...action! (Slams door on him) Come on, guys, we can escape now."
1,45,Phineas,"(Robotic voice) Escaping is wrong, and wrongness is bad."
1,45,Candace,We don't have time for this. Grab 'em!
1,45,Linda,Why is Morty Williams running off with our children?
1,45,Lawrence,I don't know.
1,45,Sergeant,"Attention, all personnel. Two students have escaped with the help of Morty Williams, syndicated daytime talk show host. Weekday mornings. Check local listings for time and channel. (dogs barking)"
1,45,Candace,"Come on, this way!"
1,45,Morty Williams,"Yep, it's time to go back inside the Smile Away Reformatory School for more footage. Those zombified brats are making me one rich - (shouting; dogs barking; barking continues)"
1,45,Candace,(gasps) I've got to buy us some time.
1,45,Sergeant,It's Morty Williams! Get him!
1,45,Guards,Oh! Ow! Ow!
1,45,Sergeant,"Hey, wait a minute. Look. They tricked us."
1,45,Guards,Get him! (dogs barking) Get him!
1,45,Candace,"We made it! Okay, guys, this is your department. Fix the car, quick!"
1,45,Phineas,(Robotic voice) Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible.
1,45,Jeremy,"Uh, Candace?"
1,45,Candace,You don't have to build anything. Just figure out how to fix it! I'm getting your toolbox. See? Your tools!
1,45,Candace,A bridge? You can build a bridge across the ravine!
1,45,Phineas,Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy.
1,45,Candace,"Great, great. Make me happy. Put on your helmet head systems, use your tools and do what you do best - build a bridge and Save Us!"
1,45,Phineas,Creative acts are imitable and dangerous.
1,45,Candace,"Listen to me, guys. Forget everything they told you. Creativity isn't bad. It's the best thing about you. (Sobbing) You two can do anything, and that's why I've always been secretly proud to be your older sister. What have I done?! What have I done?!"
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb...I know what we're gonna do today."
1,45,Candace,Yes! They're back!
1,45,Sergeant,Too late. They're mine. (dogs barking) And so are you. (gasps; rocks crumbling; gasps) Look!
1,45,Candace,Perry has a hat?!
1,45,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,45,Sergeant,"(screams; gasps) La la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la - (thud)"
1,45,Candace,Do you think he'll be...
1,45,Phineas,"♪ Corn dog, corn dog. Yummy, yummy, yummy. ♪"
1,45,Candace,"Okay. Where did you get that... Mom, Dad! Thank goodness. The strangest thing just happened."
1,45,Baljeet's voice,Fear not. Your parents are here now.
1,45,Candace,Huh?
1,45,Baljeet,The real shock is you're just noticing this now.
1,45,Candace,What?
1,45,Talking Zebra,"I'm just as confused as you are, Kevin."
1,45,Jeremy,"Candace, since I have no idea what will happen next, I need to tell you something. I love you, Candace Flynn. Will you marry me?"
1,45,Candace,"Oh, Jeremy! I always dreamed - (record needle scratches) Wait a minute. That's it! I'm dreaming!"
1,45,Jeremy,That would explain the talking zebra.
1,45,Candace,"Nah. I see him all the time. This, this is actually the freaky part. And it's all just been one...big..."
1,45,Candace,Dream! (pause) So none of that really happened. I never actually busted Phineas and Ferb. I am so happy.
1,45,Candace,"And suddenly Mom, Dad and Baljeet were controlled by a giant puppet master!"
1,45,Phineas,Cool.
1,45,Candace,"Yeah, so I'm standing there, and Jeremy comes over and says (pauses to correct her words) certain things. And..."
1,45,Linda,(to Lawrence) Go grab my journal. This is comedy gold.
1,45,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, we should build a device that projects your dreams like a movie. I'd love to see what Perry dreams about."
1,45,Perry,(chatters)
1,45,Candace,"Ooh, I almost forgot. Perry was in the dream too. He was like a super-secret agent or something."
1,45,Ferb,Perhaps that's where he disappears to everyday.
1,45,SSSN,"Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!"
1,45,Candace,"Hey, Wait, What are you doing? Hey!"
1,45,Lawrence,Oh!
1,45,Linda,Oh!
1,45,Phineas,Wait a minute. What's going on? I haven't even finished my cereal!
1,45,Major Monogram,"Agent P, your cover's been blown! You're going to have to relocate!"
1,45,Phineas,"Ah, hey, Perry. What's wrong, boy? You sounded like you were having a bad dream. It's okay now. Go back to sleep. (lies down and closes eyes, going back to sleep)"
1,45,Sergeant,I said no funky rhythms!
1,45,Phineas,"Y'know, Ferb. He's right. That was a little funky."
1,47,Baljeet,"To truly understand my predicament, I feel it will be best expressed in a song. (Claps hands twice)"
1,47,Candace,"Let's see, who should I call first to hang out with? (Holds up cell phone) How about Jeremy!"
1,47,Jeremy,"(Via recording) Hey, it's Jeremy. You know what to do after the (beep)"
1,47,Candace,"Oh, hey, Jeremy. It's Candace. Uh, just seeing what's going on today. Call me back if you want to. Okay, bye! (Closes cell phone) Oh, man, that never gets easier. Oh, well, I'll just call Stacy. (Opens cell phone) She's probably been waiting by the phone all morning."
1,47,Stacy,"(Via recording) You've reached Stacy's mobile. Leave a message, I'll get back to you."
1,47,Candace,"Hey, Stace! It's Candace. Where are you? Call me! Hmm. That's weird. Who else can I call? I know! Jenny! I haven't seen her since the boys built a beach in the backyard."
1,47,Jenny,Hello?
1,47,Candace,"Jenny, hey, it's Candy."
1,47,Jenny,"(Via recording) Leave a message, I'll get back to you as soon as possible."
1,47,Candace,"Call me. Hmm. Who else do I know? Becky, this is Candace. I know we haven't talked since kindergarten, but... Hey, Wendy. This is Candace. We shared a seat on the bus to planetarium. Hello? Clarissa, this is Candace. We played volleyball at camp. Jill? Nancy? Barbara? Olga? Chicago Joe!"
1,47,Woman,Information.
1,47,Candace,See a movie with me. (Screams) Where is everyone?
1,47,Candace,Are they all out having fun without me?
1,47,Candace,"So all my friends need some time to themselves, huh? Well, not without me they're not."
1,47,Manager,"Hey; I'm looking for Jeremy too. I need him to work tomorrow. Our fry guy just defected over to Taco Tepee. (at Taco Tepee manager) You win this one, Cooks with Grease!"
1,47,Candace,Am I that bad to hang out with?
1,47,Candace,Ooh! A text message. And it's from Stacy!
1,47,Candace,"""CYL, BFF, S."" What does that mean? Let's see. ""Candace, You Loser....Bad Friendships Fail...Stacy."" Harsh!"
1,47,Pidgeons,(Cooing)
1,47,Candace,"(sighs) Feels like I don't exist anymore, like I'm a nobody. I wish I could go to some cool faraway place and start over. Wait a minute. Those are Phineas and Ferb's bikes!"
1,47,Baljeet,"Inside I am thanking you a thousand times, even though on the outside I remain quite frugal."
1,47,Phineas,See you tomorrow.
1,47,Candace,What are you guys up to?
1,47,Phineas,"We just built a teleport to a cool, faraway place."
1,47,Candace,"Well, that's all I needed to hear! Candace Flynn is out. Peace! (Walks through the portal)"
1,47,Phineas,Welcome to Mars.
1,47,Candace,Mars?!
1,47,Baljeet,"Oh, no! The portal is broken! Ooh, now I will not get a good grade at the science fair tomorrow, and, uh,... there's also the issue of your sister stranded on a distant, barren planet."
1,47,Phineas,"Don't worry, we can fix it. Heh. Candace is probably laughing about it as we speak!"
1,47,Candace,PHINEAS!!!
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, what's up? Oh, are you here to...? Oh, no, no. I'm running a little behind. I'm still in the middle of basic plotting and scheming. Of course, I-I...can't give you my evil scheme monologue because I write that last. Sorry! That's just how I roll."
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, wait! Why don't you help me? That way I can finish faster and you can defeat me faster. It's win-win! Let me grab my coupons. We'll start by shopping for some supplies."
1,47,Candace,"You guys are so busted! (echoing) Busted...busted... Now I truly am alone. (Notices a Mars Rover) Hey, it's one of those Mars Rovers. I'm saved!"
1,47,Man,"(Screaming) I can't take it anymore! I've been staring at red rocks for 20 years! That's all that is on that stupid planet! Red rocks! Face it, there's no life on Mars. That's it! I'm shutting this place down! Game over! (The screen shuts down)"
1,47,Candace,"(While kicking at the Mars Rover) Stupid Rover! You're not going to ignore me too. Take that, you ugly, unmanned exploratory vehicle! And that!"
1,47,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought. (Notices a Martian) Huh?"
1,47,Martian,(Taps the broken Rover)
1,47,Candace,What are you?
1,47,Martian,(Screeches)
1,47,Martians,(Speaking in a foreign language)
1,47,Candace,What's going on? What are you doing? Put me down!
1,47,Phineas,There! I think we fixed it.
1,47,Baljeet,"No, that is Venus. And that is Earth in prehistoric time. (Gasps, yells) Change it, change it, change it! Hey, look, it is us in the future fixing the portal."
1,47,Baljeet of the future,"Hello, Baljeet of the past! Just watch us. That is how we learned to fix it. Gesundheit!"
1,47,Baljeet,Thanks. (Sneezes)
1,47,Phineas,"It worked. Cool! (At Baljeet) Ok, give us 20 minutes to find Candace, then open up the portal."
1,47,Baljeet,"Ooh, please be careful. I still need your help at the science fair tomorrow."
1,47,Phineas,Hmm. Something tells me Candace was here. Good thing you brought your tools. I got an idea.
1,47,Candace,"Okay, what's going on? (A Martian places a crown on her head) Ooh. You're making me your ruler?"
1,47,Martians,(Speaking foreign language)
1,47,Candace,Cool! Let's get this party started! Crank the tunes.
1,47,Martians,(Blinking)
1,47,Candace,"Uh, you know, music. You guys don't know what music is? Well, it's like...it's like this."
1,47,Candace,That's it! You're getting it.

1,47,Candace,♪ I was just a lonely girl ♪
1,47,Phineas,"Whoo-hoo! Follow that music, Ferb!"
1,47,Candace,"You are much more attentive than my friends on Earth, and better at building statues of me. Come on, let's walk and talk. Of course, I'll do most of the talking. Okay. To make things easier, I'll call you Good Stacy, and you, Good Jenny. And...huh?"
1,47,Martians,(Speaking foreign language)
1,47,Candace,"Oh, okay, what the heck? (Smashes a Mars Rover)"
1,47,Martians,(Cheering)
1,47,Phineas,"Hey, Candace."
1,47,Candace,Phineas? Ferb?
1,47,Martians,(Chattering indistinctly)
1,47,Phineas,We're here to rescue you.
1,47,Candace,Why would I go back to being a nobody when I could be the queen of here?
1,47,Phineas,"Well, there's a lot of... Uh, Candace, what's up with your friends?"
1,47,Candace,"Ah, ignore them. They're harmless. Hey, why don't you hang out while so you can tell everyone how popular I've become."
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(While pushing a shopping cart) Okay, I've already got the chicken wire. Let's see. Oh, here! (Hands a list to Perry, who's sitting in the child's seat) You-you...take the list and cross things off as we go. Should we get something for later, like...like...one of those big pickles or a three-bean salad? (he bumps the shopping cart against another one)"
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, that was awkward."
1,47,Candace,"I'm just gonna go for a walk. (A group of Martians points to a Mars Rover) Uh...uh...guys, not now, okay? (more Martians surrounds her) No, really, I would just like to got for a walk alone. (Groaning) (At Phineas and Ferb) There you are! Where've you guys been?"
1,47,Phineas,Ferb was just explaining to the Martians how we got here.
1,47,Candace,"Oh. Wait, what?"
1,47,Phineas,Ferb speaks Martian. They're really excited about the idea of a science fair.
1,47,Candace,Figures. I'm the queen of little green nerds. Can you tell them that I want a little time to myself?
1,47,"Ferb, Martian",(Both speaking Martian)
1,47,Ferb,"They say fine, but not without them."
1,47,Candace,"(Groans) Okay; just because I need to do things without you, sometimes, doesn't mean I don't like you or don't appreciate your friendship."
1,47,Phineas,"But Candace, isn't that..."
1,47,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, just like my friends with me. Whoop-de-doo!"
1,47,Martians,(All speaking Martian)
1,47,Phineas,It appears the Martians are blaming us for their queen wanting to leave.
1,47,Candace,Quick! Get in! Queen Candace is out! Peace!
1,47,Martians,(All screeching)
1,47,Phineas,Did you know they could do that?
1,47,Candace,"No, but get this: Every part of their body is a musical instrument, and they never discovered music before. Martians are so lame."
1,47,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. You got your cell phone on you? (At Baljeet) Hello, Baljeet?"
1,47,Candace,How is it we have bars here?
1,47,Phineas,We kinda need you to open the portal now.
1,47,Candace,They're gaining on us!
1,47,Giant Martian,(Screaming)
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, thanks for your help. I usually hate shopping, but, you know. You make it fun."
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"What, that? Oh, that's my first Inator. Good story. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. Well, I should probably get back to my latest evil scheme! (Slams door with a foot) So long...sucker!"
1,47,Candace,"Mom, Mom!"
1,47,Linda,"Well, hello, Candace. Where've you been? I want you to see my telescope."
1,47,Candace,A telescope? Perfect!
1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, I don't even remember what this does. (He pushes a button on the Inator, and a green beam shoots out of it) Oh, that's right, it just shoots a beam into space. No wonder why I lost to a baking soda volcano."
1,47,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb built this portal to Mars. I went through it and was crowned queen of the Martians. Now I know it sounds crazy, but this time, I have proof."
1,47,Candace,Who does that look like?
1,47,Linda,"(while looking through the telescope) Hmm. Well, it looks a little like a rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig."
1,47,Candace,What? Let me see that.

1,47,Jenny,"Hey, Candace."
1,47,Candace,"Oh, there you are, guys! Where have you been all day?"
1,47,Jenny,I was at the dentist.

1,47,Stacy,"Didn't you get my text message? ""Call You Later, Best Friends Forever. Stacy."""

1,47,Unknown guy,"Actually, I was trying to avoid you."
1,47,Candace,(Pauses) Do I know you?
1,47,Unknown guy,"No, that's how great it's been working. Unknown guy is out. Pee-ace!"

1,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on!"
1,46,Phineas,What should we do today? (First slide appears) Build an underwater skate park? Sounds pretty wicked! (Second slide appears) Fly with rocket-powered bat wings? Awesome! (Third slide appears) Teach Perry tricks. (He and Ferb looks at Perry) He's just a platypus. He doesn't do much.
1,46,Phineas,"Oh, hi, Isabella."
1,46,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas. You might wanna go check up on Baljeet. I was walking by his house and heard him scream... ""AIIIEEEE!!! I'M DOOMED TO BE AN INCOMPETENT FLUNKEE FOREVER!!! Ever...ever...ever..."" (pause) I added the echo part."
1,46,Phineas,Sounds pretty serious.
1,46,Phineas,Baljeet! It's Phineas and Ferb. (Opens door to Baljeet's room) Why are all the lights off?
1,46,Baljeet,Darkness is a shroud that hides my shame.
1,46,Phineas,"(Turns on light switch) Hey, buddy, why don't you tell us what's going on."
1,46,Baljeet,"Because of the 17 summer school classes I am taking, I qualified for the science fair. So I decided to design this."
1,46,Phineas,(Takes blueprint; he and Ferb holds it up) A portal to Mars? Cool!
1,46,Baljeet,"No, not cool. (Grabs blueprint; rolls it up) When I showed my teacher, he said..."
1,46,Male Teacher,A portal to Mars? And what does it do?
1,46,Baljeet,"Well, without over-complicating things, it's a portal to Mars. You step through it and you're on Mars."
1,46,Male Teacher,"Well, this is very...creative. But, unless you can build a working model, the best I can give you is..."
1,46,Baljeet,An A-minus?! That would be the worst grade of my life!
1,46,Phineas,Why don't you just build one?

1,46,Wendy,"Sounds like a great idea to me. (At Candace) Good luck. (Extends hand; quickly takes it away) Ooh, too slow. I think I'll call you Molasses."
1,46,Candace,"Molasses. Well, I think I'll call you something...slower than molasses, that's for sure."
1,46,Candace,"This isn't part of the competition, is it?"
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus, welcome to my truck of doom. (Stops truck; Pushes a button)"
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,"I suppose you're wondering why I'm wearing lederhosen. (Pauses; Perry glares at him) What? I've the legs for it! (Stretches right leg on dashboard) Eh? Eh? Eh? (Lowers right leg) Anyway, it will all become clear soon enough!"

1,46,Doofenshmirtz,"No! What makes you say that? I mean, look at me! I'm wearing lederhosen!"
1,46,Elderly man,(Pauses) Okay. Go ahead.
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,(Chuckles; to Perry) See? I know what I'm doing.
1,46,Baljeet,"(Cheerfully) Hi, Mr. McGillicuddy."
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Well, I see you've built yourself a prototype, but the question still remains: Does...it...work?"
1,46,Baljeet,"Well, I think..."
1,46,Phineas,"Of course it works! Baljeet, fire it up."
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Ok, so I see science fair."
1,46,Baljeet,"Take a closer look, Mr. McGillicuddy."
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Wow! A science fair on Mars! Baljeet, you have just validated my entire career as an educator! You get an A+++! (Voice squeaks) I'm gonna go get the judges!"
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,Soon I will show them the havoc created when an acid and a base combine! (Laughs; dramatic music) But first I have to find an outlet 'cause there's a nice laser show that goes along with it. We'll take this out and put mine in. (Chuckles) Hello!
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"It's right over here. (At Baljeet) Baljeet, show our judges what Mr. McGillicuddy has taught you."
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"Ah, um, just a moment. It takes the skilled hand of a master professor. (Chuckles) Hello! Mr. Martian! It's Mr. McGillicuddy. (Chuckles) Uno momento."
1,46,Judge #1,Who's up for corn dogs?
1,46,Judge #2,I am.
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"A-ha! Turn it all the way up to high. (Switches dial from ""low"" to ""high"") Yes! That should do it."
1,46,Phineas,I wonder what's wrong with the portal?
1,46,Baljeet,"Ah, no matter. Actually, I never cared about winning. I just wanted a good grade."
1,46,Phineas,"Aah. Well, who's up for corn dogs?"
1,46,Baljeet,Me!
1,46,Manager,"Girls, your first task is to dress these dogs with ketchup and mustard. I'll be back in a bit to check your work. Good luck!"
1,46,Wendy,(Growls)
1,46,Candace,"(Holds up a bottle of ketchup) Hey, no fair! I ran out of ketchup. (Squeezes the bottle, then grins sheepishly.) Oops. Now I'm out of ketchup."
1,46,Wendy,(Squeezes a bottle of mustard) Oops. Now I'm out of mustard.
1,46,Candace,"(Squeezes a bottle of relish twice) Oh, look, I'm out of relish!"
1,46,Wendy,(Laughing)
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"It's gotta work, it's gotta...work! Huh? (notices the plug to the portal)"
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,Now just add some vinegar and... (Perry lands on his head; he screams)
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,"It just wasn't plugged in. There's an outlet over there. (Notices a high voltage outlet; plugs the cord in, cackling) It's working! It's working!"
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Ew, gross! I smell like...salad. (Mumbling; slips on vinegar; lands in the volcano, which then ""erupts"") Say goodbye to this pair of lederhosen. Hey, I'm unhurt! Yes, I am invincible! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where am I going?"
1,46,Judge #1,"All right, so what was it you wanted to show us?"
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,(Stuttering) No! It was here!
1,46,Judge #1,"Come on, let's go find a real winner."
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,But... But... But...
1,46,Girl,"Excuse me, am I too late to enter?"
1,46,Judge #1,Are those mechanical arms?
1,46,Girl,"Why, yes. I used them to make this baking soda volcano."
1,46,Judge #1,(Gasps) A baking soda volcano? Cool! 1st prize!
1,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on!"
1,46,Mr. McGillicuddy,But...
1,46,Manager,"Well, seeing as you've used most of my ketchup and mustard to dress yourselves, I'm afraid neither of you get the job."
1,46,Candace,Snail! I'll call you you Snail. Ha!
1,46,Wendy,You're quick.
1,46,Isabella,I just can't believe you built a portal to Mars and didn't go through it yourselves!
1,46,Phineas,"Oh, we did."
1,46,Ferb,But that's another story.
1,46,Phineas,"Oh, look."
1,46,"Phineas, Ferb, and Baljeet",♪ There's Perryyyyyy! ♪
1,42,Phineas,"Hey, Dad! Whatcha watching?"
1,42,Lawrence,"Oh, it's a favorite kids show from when I was a lad. Oh, they don't make this anymore."
1,42,(Song,Pinhead Pierre Theme)
1,42,Pinhead Pierre,"No pointing and laughing, kids! Because now it's time for another adventure of Captain Implausible!"
1,42,Narrator,"When we last saw our hero, the Earth was being threatened by evil space aliens."
1,42,Alien #1,Bow-chicka-wow-wow.
1,42,Alien #2,Chicka-chicka-choo-wop.
1,42,Phineas,Captain Implausible?
1,42,Lawrence,That's right! He possesses virtually every super power there is.
1,42,Captain Implausible,"(Throws rocket at UFO, which blows up)"
1,42,Crowd,(Cheering)
1,42,Pinhead Pierre,"Wasn't that great, kids? Ya can't beat Captain Implausible. It's impossible!"
1,42,Lawrence,(Chuckles) That was the best! And I happen to own the single greatest collection of Pinhead Pierre paraphernalia in all the world.
1,42,Phineas,Gosh.
1,42,Lawrence,"Oh, yeah. I'm not proud."
1,42,Pinhead Pierre,"Time for the question of the day. Thank you, Debbie. And the question of the day is, ""If you could have one superpower, what would it be?"""
1,42,Lawrence,"(pauses video) You see, right there. Modern cartoon shows never ask the really big questions, do they?"
1,42,Phineas,"That's it! We could have as many superpowers as we want if we were cartoons! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
1,42,Lawrence,"(unpauses video) Oh, well, at least Perry will watch these with me. Won't you, Perry? Perry?"
1,42,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. I apologize for using the emergency chute and, uh, for not telling you we had an emergency chute. But there was an emergency. Shoot! (Laughs) Sorry. (Clears throat) What I'm about to say is highly classified, Agent P. The last century, the forces of good and evil have been locked in a desperate race to harness and control the limitless power of dance."
1,42,Carl,"Dance! How was that, sir?"
1,42,Major Monogram,"You came in a little late there, Carl. Get back over there. We'll try it again. (Clears throat) Blah, blah, blah, the power of dance."
1,42,Carl,Dance! Better?
1,42,Major Monogram,"Early. Anyhoo, much to our horror, it appears the side of evil has won. Have you seen the latest issue of Evil Beat! magazine? Dr. Doofenshmirtz has created a ray that causes people to dance uncontrollably. It's up to you to stop him, Agent P. But be careful. It's a known fact that no one - no one - has ever defeated evil while dancing. Good luck, Agent P."
1,42,Phineas,"Excellent. We'll be up and running in no time. (Cow moos) Hey, sis."
1,42,Candace,"Hold it right there, busters. (Truck beeping) Before I squeal on you rats, and you know I must, will you please tell me what's going on here?"
1,42,Phineas,We're building an animation studio so we can make our very own cartoon show.
1,42,Candace,I thought cartoons were all made by computer.
1,42,Phineas,"Yeah, that's right. This is just for show. This is where the magic happens. It's the PF-5000 Animatron. All you do is tell the machine what you want. I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'll be called Multi Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt and use lots of crazy gadgets. He'll be called, um, Ferb Guy."
1,42,Candace,"Well, I would have super mind control and use telepathy and telekinesis to keep you super-dweebs under control with your lame-o superpowers."
1,42,Phineas,"We could call you Control Freak. Come on, let's watch. (Music instrumental, whirring) We start with a few crude drawings. (Chickens clucking) We compile those into a storyboard, and it all gets fed into the computer. Then we add a little story and some pithy dialog. (Monkey screeches, Cat meows, Parrot noise) The Executron analyzes it and makes a few notes."
1,42,The Executron,Does not track. Whose story arc is this anyway? This one is not one of my favorites.
1,42,Phineas,The Artbot addresses the notes.
1,42,The Artbot,"(Beeping, Glass smashing) No more notes. No more notes. (Crashes)"
1,42,Phineas,"Few changes are made, then it goes to timing. (Chanting) The shreds get fed into here, and somehow it all comes together here in the Animatic. Check it out. We're super dudes."
1,42,Candace,You guys are super busted as soon as I tell Mom.
1,42,Isabella,"Hi, Phineas."
1,42,Buford,Whatcha do-- (Isabella elbows him) Ugh!
1,42,Isabella,Whatcha doin'?
1,42,Phineas,"Come into the Phineas and Ferb Studios, and we'll show you."
1,42,Buford,"Hey, Isabella, about that ""Whatcha doin'?"" back there-"
1,42,Isabella,"Up, up, up! We'll talk about it later."
1,42,Phineas,"Over here is where we add sound effects. Did you know that for years, a balloon was used for the majority of sounds you hear in cartoons? Ferb will demonstrate. Ferb?"
1,42,Ferb,(Ding)
1,42,Baljeet,"May we be in the show, too?"
1,42,Phineas,"Absolutely. A very wise and small-headed man once asked, ""If you could have any superpower, what would it be?"""
1,42,Isabella,"I would harness the power of rainbows, unicorns and sweetness to defend all that is good and just. I'd become... The Rainbow."
1,42,Phineas,"Wow, that's great. What about you, Buford?"
1,42,Buford,"It's an interesting question you pose, as it reveals not only one's impulses and desires, but one's deepest fears as well. I'll go with Belchman."
1,42,Phineas,"Cool. How 'bout you, Baljeet?"
1,42,Baljeet,Isabella took mine.
1,42,Phineas,"Hmm. School seems to be very important to you. Books, being responsible and studious, getting good grades..."
1,42,Baljeet,"Oh! That's it! I will become Hanuman Man, a flying blue monkey that can grow as massive as he desires to crush all in his way!"
1,42,Phineas,(pause) Fun choice.
1,42,Candace,"Phineas, I –"
1,42,Phineas,"Hi, Candace. You're just in time to help us record the voices."
1,42,Candace,There is no way on Earth I'd ever help you.

1,41,Phineas,"Wow! Your Dad's exhibit is really amazing! I can see where you get your artistic talent from, Django."

1,41,Phineas,This is a great painting! Your Dad would love this.

1,41,Phineas,"Why don't you just paint something bigger? Look out there, Django. Your father's display just happens to be right next to the Unpainted Desert. And that gives me an idea. (to Ferb) Ferb, we're gonna need some really big art supplies."

1,41,Django,"Well, I made this for you, but (Beppo takes the picture) it's kinda small compared to what you do. It's not real art."
1,41,Beppo,"It's beautiful, son. (Shakes his hair) You're a real artist."
1,41,Django,Really?
1,41,Beppo,"With your permission, (Holds up the picture) there's a very special place I'd like to put this. Come on, bud."
1,41,Phineas,Wow. There's no higher place of honor than the fridge.
1,41,Ferb,Especially a giant fridge.
1,41,Doofenshmirtz,"(Depressed) Oh, Dr. Gevaarlijk, today was supposed to be the day that I impressed you (Walks away) with the enormity of my evil schemes and finally earn your respect."
1,41,Dr. Gevaarlijk,Oh Heinz. Evil doesn't always have to be on a big scale. You can spread evil in the little things you do everyday.
1,41,Doofenshmirtz,(Touched) You're right.
1,41,Dr. Gevaarlijk,"(Walks to Doof) But sadly, you can't even do that! You're a total failure! You sicken me, Heinz Doofenshmirtz! (Walks away) Gevaarlijk out! (Slams door)"
1,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow. That could have gone better. (Perry walks up) Oh, there you are, Perry the Platypus. Oh, you... You saw that, huh? Yes. Of course. (Pause) You think I'm evil, right? (Perry smiles) Thank you, Perry the Platypus. (Camera pans to Perry and him looking at the moon) Thank you."

1,40,Phineas,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We thought it only fair that the show you're about to see may disturb you. It may shock you. It may even horrify you!"
1,40,Ferb,(Spew out a hairball)
1,40,Phineas,You've been warned.
1,40,Phineas,"Looks like a real summer storm! (Thunder crashes) Well, our plan to stand alone in a field with a metal rod is out."
1,40,Grandpa Reg,(Reading a newspaper) This weather isn't fit for man nor platypus.
1,40,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
1,40,Major Monogram,"(Comes out of curtains) Good morning, Agent P. (Puts his arms behind him) The mission you're about to receive may shock you. It may even horrify you! But then again, probably not, I mean, heh. You have been doing this for awhile. Anyway, sorry about the tarp behind me. Storm caused some water damage, and-- (Looks at his watch) Ooh! Cheese and crackers! Late for my cousin's wedding. Gotta go. Doofenshmirtz is up to something, and you know what to do."
1,40,Phineas,Hmm. I wonder where Perry goes off to.
1,40,Grandpa Reg,"Lost your platypus, eh? (Camera zooms out) That reminds me of a really great monster story."
1,40,Phineas,"Tell us, Grandpa!"
1,40,Grandpa Reg,It's about Ferb's ancestor. He was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great uncle.
1,40,Candace,Great.
1,40,Grandpa Reg,"(Turns on a flashlight) It was a long time ago, back in the old country, on a cold moonlit night."
1,40,Grandpa Reg,Your great uncle Ferbgor was assisting the famous Dr. Phineastein (In the flashback a platypus walks up) in the macabre task of collecting spare parts from semi-aquatic mammals. (In the flashback the platypus gives Ferbgor a steering wheel and runs off)
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Hey, Ferbgor, the Monster's (Ferbgor walks up) Ball Best Monster Contest. A big prize goes to the best monster! Sweet. I know what we're gonna do today! (Cackles)"
1,40,Grandpa Reg,"(Narrating) Back at Castle Phineastein, the boys began building a monster."
1,40,Candace,"(Jumps in) Can you at least tell a story in color, Grandpa? (The flashback changes into color. The castle's in different colors, the sky is pink with a rainbow behind the castle)"
1,40,Phineas,"(Jumps in) Perhaps muted color would be better. (The flashback turns into a faded green and muted grey background, with the characters in the flashback now in color)"
1,40,Grandpa Reg,(Jumps in) Who's telling the story anyway? (Grandpa Reg goes off and Candace and Phineas run off-screen. The camera zooms into the castle) Did I mention that the boys had a conniving and disapproving governess named Constance?
1,40,Constance,"(While using a quill) So, anyway, (Clattering) Jeremiah was, like, totally checking me out when-- Will you hold it down? I am trying to use the quill!"
1,40,Phineastein,"Isn't it beautiful, Ferbgor? We're on the verge of bringing life to the (Walks to the counter) best monster ever. Okay, let her rip!"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,It's alive! ALIVE!!! (Laughs maniacally and the platypus monster sits up) And it's really big.
1,40,Phineas,"How big, Grandpa?"
1,40,Grandpa Reg,Bigger than a refrigerator but smaller than a really big refrigerator.
1,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't close that door! (The door slams. The camera zooms out and he walks on-screen holding a candle) Oh, that's just great! The storms made my security system go all cuckoo, and you just locked us in. (Sighs) Well, you might as well make yourself comfy, 'cause we're stuck in here till the power comes back on. (Thunder crashes as the scene switches to Doofenshmirtz and Perry sitting in chairs) Ooh, quite a storm, huh? Reminds me of a story Papa Doofenshmirtz used to tell me to scare me into wetting the bed. (Laughs) That prankster! (Camera zooms into him) It began a long time ago with my great-great grandfather, Dr. Jekyll Doofenshmirtz!"
1,40,Doofenshmirtz,"(Jekyll Doofenshmirtz puts the screw on a machine) (Narrating) He was obsessed with being (Jekyll Doofenshmirtz screws the screw into place) the most evil scientist of his time. Back then, to be considered truly evil, you actually had to have an angry mob after you."
1,40,Jameson,Your 11:00 is here.
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"The angry mob?! Ooh, they're early. Show them to the parlor."
1,40,Woman,(Sips)
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"Top of the morning, angry mob."
1,40,Man,"Let's hurry this along, Doctor. We've got a tar-and-feathering at noon."
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, of course, of course. This time I know I've created something evil enough to warrant your full attention and anger. The Concoction Brew-Inator! A diabolical machine that produces a potion (Turns the Concoction Brew-Inator on) to turn a normal man, (The Concoction Brew-Inator turns off) like myself, (Grabs the cup) into a horrible monster! (Drinks the potion) Now... tremble before me!"
1,40,Mob,(Laughing)
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(Seen as a fairy) What? You're not so much trembling. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Come back! (The mob leaves. The last person in the mob closes the door) So you're not an angry mob right now, but... I bet you're slightly irritated, right? I should get points for that! I should get points for that."
1,40,Grandpa Reg,"Uh, where was I? Oh, yes! Now, the boys had a real monster on their hands, and they had to get him ready for the big night."
1,40,Phineastein,"Come on! That-a-boy! Check it out, Ferbgor. (Throws a fish in the Platypus monster's mouth) To make sure we win that monster contest, I taught him a few tricks. Watch this. Play dead! (The platypus monster doesn't move) Huh? Huh?"
1,40,Constance,"(Still using the quill) So I said, ""Oh no, you di-in't!"" (Growling) And she said-- What was that? (Opens the door) What's going on down there? (Goes down the stairs) I will go straight to the angry mob and tell on you. (Opens another door) Aha!"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Oh, hi, Constance. (Holds up the Best Monster Contest poster) We're gonna enter the Best Monster Contest."
1,40,Constance,How are you gonna answer a monster contest? (The platypus monster walks behind Constance) You don't even have a monster!
1,40,Platypus monster,(Growls)
1,40,Constance,"He's right behind me, isn't he?"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,Yeah!
1,40,Constance,"(Screams) (Steps back and grabs Dr. Phineastein's shirt) I'm. Telling. Mob. (Runs off, screaming. She comes out of the castle on a bike) Angry mob, come quick! (Stops the bike) Phineastein and Ferbgor have created a giant green monster!"
1,40,Man 2,Didn't you tell us last week that they created a 2-headed cow?
1,40,Constance,We're wasting time! (Bikes off) Now let's hurry before the monster gets away!
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(Back to normal) Jameson, I think I found the problem. I had the Brew-Inator set to ""Fairy Princess"" by mistake. (Turns the dial) You know, in hindsight, I question even including a (Turns on the Concoction Brew-Inator) ""Fairy Princess"" setting to begin with. (The Concoction Brew-Inator whirs then turns off. He grabs the cup) But, you know, live and learn. Cheers! (Drinks the potion) Hmm... Evil has an interesting flavor. I must tell my friend, Dr.-- (He grunts and screams as he turns into a monster)"
1,40,Jameson,Hmm... It actual worked.
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"I know! I'm just as surprised as you are! Put her there, Jameson! Psych! (Laughs) (Jumps a few times) At last! A whole new world of evil has opened up to me! You know what this calls for, don't you?"
1,40,Jameson,"A rampage, sir?"
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"Exactly! Oh, and clean your uniform. (Laughs) Evil!"
1,40,(Song,"""He's Eviler"")"
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,That's me!
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"Well, not a plan so much."
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(While doing rabbit ears on two people having their picture taken) I'm winging it, actually."
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,That's right.
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,I don't think that's word.
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"Oops, gotta go. (Chuckles) (Runs to Castle Phineastein) Evil! (Knocks the handle) (Evil laughing) Hyah! Got your nose! (Laughs) I got your... I... I... I really do have his nose. (The platypus monster is seen without his bill) Oops. Heh. Okay, okay. Well, we'll just put this back. (The platypus monster is seen with his bill, but slanted) There you go. Good as new."
1,40,Platypus monster,(Growls)
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,EVIL!!!!
1,40,Phineastein,Oh great! (Puts on his hat and jacket) We really have to stop losing our monsters.
1,40,Villager,Blimey! Look what's coming!
1,40,Villagers,(Screaming) Run!
1,40,Villager 2,"(Walks to his balcony, seen wearing only his underwear) I'm finally cured of my irrational fear that a giant platypus will see me in my underpants. (The platypus monster walks by) It's even worse than I imagined!"
1,40,Isabella lookalike,Whatcha doin'?
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Hello? (Bats squeaking) (Camera pans to the inside of the cave, showing three monsters) Are there any monsters in there?"
1,40,Monster,Shh.
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"No, I guess not."
1,40,Constance,"It was right here! You have to believe me! A giant platypus! (Mob grumbling) Wait! Mob, look! (Picks up a poster) The Monster's Ball! (Turns the poster) This is where they must have gone. (They walks out of the castle) Follow me!"
1,40,Isabella Lookalike,♪ La la la la ♪ Whatcha doin'?
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,We're looking for a giant platypus monster. Have you seen one by any chance?
1,40,Isabella Lookalike,"Funny you should ask. We spent the entire afternoon together. We went swimming, had a little lunch. Did you know he eats raw snails? Ew! I stuck to PB and J on whole wheat."
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,Where is he now?
1,40,Isabella Lookalike,He went into town to enter the Best Monster Contest.
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,(Grabs Ferbgor and shakes him) Of course that's where he went! What were we thinking? Come on! (They run off)
1,40,Isabella Lookalike,Goodbye then! Tell him to save me a dance!
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Thinks for the lift, mister! (He and Ferbgor hop off) Let's go!"
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(Back to normal) Best monster, indeed. Wait till they get a load of pure evil! (Knocks off the punch bowl, cups and drink dispenser and puts the Concoction Brew-Inator on the table) We'll just adjust the dial, and-- (Turns around and notices the platypus monster. He gasps) Yah!"
1,40,Contestant,Monster fight! (Starts a fight with a contestant dressed like a hippo. Soon everyone else starts fighting)
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(While being slammed on the floor) Really, really, I don't have your nose! Wait wait. Time out. Allow me one little drink before we continue. I'm parched, okay?"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Here, boy! (At Ferbgor) I hope he hasn't gotten into any trouble."
1,40,Jekyll Doofenshmirtz,"(Drinks a potion) (Chuckles) Just wait till my potion kicks in, you big, dumb monst-- (Grunts and turns into a fairy) What?

1,40,Doofenshmirtz,"And, well, I forgot exactly what happens after that. (The lights come back on) Oh, hey, the lights! What do you know? (Gets up and stretches.. Perry also gets up and stretches) Oh, I got no time for my diabolical plan now. I've got the chiropractor at 4:00. (Walks Perry to the door) Could we pick it up tomorrow at, say, my evil scheme monologue? Good! (Camera zooms into him) But, you know, I wonder who actually did win the Best Monster Contest."
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Oh, there you are, platypus monster. (Camera pans to inside the building) And to think I worried you might get into some mischief."
1,40,Host,"Ladies and gentlemen, we're ready to announce the winner of the Best Monster Contest."
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Hey, we're just in time."
1,40,Constance,(Comes out of the building) Mob! It's here! The monster's in here!
1,40,Man,We're coming! Don't get your knickers in a twist.
1,40,Constance,"(Walks into the building by the Concoction Brew-Inator) They are so busted! (Notices the Concoction Brew-Inator) Oh, refreshments! (Grabs the cup) This monster hunting is thirsty work. (Drinks a potion) That's a peculiar taste."
1,40,Jeremiah,"Hey, Constance."
1,40,Constance,"Oh, Jeremiah!"
1,40,Jeremiah,"I can't remember a day when you looked more beautiful. (Constance turns into a monster) Well, now I can."
1,40,Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner of the Best Monster Contest is... (Camera pans to Constance as a spotlight shines on her) That!"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Way to go, Constance! (Thumbs up) Good show!"
1,40,Man,There it is!
1,40,Constance,"Wait! No, no, no! I'm not the monster! (She screams, throws the flowers, and then runs through the wall. The mob chases after her)"
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,"Oh well. (Touches the platypus monster's hand) Win some, lose some, boy. (Camera zooms into him) You'll always be the biggest, baddest monster to us."
1,40,Isabella Lookalike,(Dressed in her contest outfit) I see you found your giant platypus.
1,40,Dr. Phineastein,That's right. And we'll never lose him again.
1,40,Grandpa Reg,And that is why there are pumpkins.
1,40,Phineas,"Um, Grandpa, you were telling us about a giant platypus monster."
1,40,Grandpa Reg,"Ooh, that sounds exciting! Tell me about that."
1,40,Phineas,But you were-- I mean-- I didn't-- (Sighs) (The lights come back on) I've got nothing. Ferb?
1,40,Ferb,Platypus monsters are the only monsters to lay eggs.
1,48,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb."
1,48,Phineas,Have you seen bolt #473?
1,48,Candace,"Okay, it's still here. Oh, come on, Mom! We're really coming down to the wire on this one."
1,48,Linda,"Thanks, Vivian. See you Tuesday for totem pole carving."
1,48,Candace,"Mom! Mom! Quick, Mom, look! Before it disappears!"
1,48,Linda,"Well, if it isn't the welcoming committee. -"
1,48,Candace,"No time for dry, witty remarks! Must move. Move, move, move, move! Move, move, move, move!"
1,48,Linda,Don't you get tired of this?
1,48,Candace,What do you mean?
1,48,Linda,"The same old routine every day. Doesn't it ever get--"" mm, I don't know-- boring?"
1,48,Candace,"...You know what? You're right. I guess it has gotten a little old. I just get so frustrated. I always come so close to busting Phineas and Ferb, but it ends the same way every single time. I look and say there's a massive ""thing"" Phineas and Ferb built right in front of me, but every time you look, you always say..."
1,48,Linda,I...see it.
1,48,Candace,"There it is. ""I see it."" Right on you. Wait, what? Come again?"
1,48,Linda,I see it!
1,48,Candace,You mean you see my point?
1,48,Linda,"No, Candace. I see that! (she points at the tower)"
1,48,Candace,(Gasps) You do?!
1,48,Linda,How could I miss it? But I don't understand. How the...? Or who the...? B-- What the?
1,48,Phineas,"Hi, Mom! Check it out! The Flying Car of the Future; Today!"
1,48,Linda,Is that my...car?!
1,48,Candace,"(Ecstatic) She sees the car, too!"
1,48,Phineas,"(To Ferb) The Flying Car of the Future; Today, is still pulling a bit to the right."
1,48,Linda,(In the distance) PHINEAS! FERB! GET DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!!!
1,48,Phineas,"Okay, Mom, be right down."
1,48,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry. (To Linda) So, what do you think, Mom? Pretty cool, huh?"
1,48,Linda,Cool?! This is the most dangerous thing I've ever seen!!
1,48,Phineas,"Don't worry, we were safe. Ferb invented a new invisible helmet head system. (He and Ferb take off hats that look like their normal heads) ""When life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull."""
1,48,Linda,How dare you do all this without permission!
1,48,Phineas,But all our building permits are in order.
1,48,Linda,"I mean, my permission."
1,48,Phineas,This morning I asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly.
1,48,Linda,"I was talking about your toy car!! How could you possibly think I meant my station wagon?! You are in SO much trouble, young man!!!"
1,48,Phineas,But...we do this sort of thing every day.
1,48,Linda,(Her anger now replaced with shock) What?!!
1,48,Candace,"(Sounding a bit smug) See, Mom? I told you...but you never listened."
1,48,Linda,But I...
1,48,Memory-Candaces,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster! Phineas and Ferb are one-hit wonders? Phineas and Ferb carved my face into Mount Rushmore. Phineas and Ferb are driving cattle. Phineas and Ferb built a giant tree house robot... (The next several begin to slur together as they quickly come to her) are promoting a boxing match...built a beach in the backyard...built a time machine... built a ski resort! Are directing a movie... built a haunted house... built a giant sundae maker... are getting the band back together... Phineas and Ferb are in my large intestine!"
1,48,Linda,"Oh, Candace. All the times I called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back, all those journals I've filled with an eye towards stand-up comedy...but you were telling the truth! I'm so sorry. You're the best daughter any mother could dream of having."
1,48,Candace,"Finally, you realize that!"
1,48,Lawrence,"Well, what's all this yelling about? (Notices the tower) Oh, my word! That is impressive."
1,48,Linda,Did you know about this?
1,48,Lawrence,"Well, I -- I...I -- I, uh...no."
1,48,Candace,(Clearly overjoyed) What are you gonna do to them? No TV for a month? Or -- they have to serve me for a year. (gasps) How about confiscating their toolbox? (gasps) I know! Take away their seats on the city council!
1,48,Linda,You have seats on the city council?
1,48,Phineas,We rotate out with the Board of Selectmen.
1,48,Lawrence,"Well, some punishment may be in order, but, look, there's no harm done really."
1,48,Phineas,"Hey, look, Ferb, here's bolt number 473. I hope that wasn't important."
1,48,Phineas,"Well, at least the self-parking works."
1,48,Candace,(Grinning widely) Ee-ee-ee-ee!
1,48,Linda,"I'm sorry, but this is really for your own good. We need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous. I'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt."
1,48,Phineas,We were wearing helmets. (A sergeant walks behind the bus then holds a Smile Away Reformatory School brochure with an image of a sun on it.)
1,48,Sergeant,"Don't worry. Your boys will be in good hands. As you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the Smile Away Reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged. Your boys will be whipped into shape in no time."
1,48,Phineas,"Well, I'll be honest, Ferb, I didn't see this coming. (Notices Baljeet is on the bus too) Baljeet? What are you doing here?"
1,48,Baljeet,"Well, I got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high. But then I heard about this place. Sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but school is school."
1,48,Lawrence,"Bye, boys. See you at the end of summer!"
1,48,Candace,"Yes, I actually busted Phineas and Ferb! (sighs) This is the happiest moment of my life! Woo-hoo! (Candace acts like an acrobat. Elsewhere in the sky, she skydives with two teenagers, soaring pass a meadow.) I'm finally free!"
1,48,(Song,"""The Good Life"")"
1,48,Phineas,That doesn't look like the brochure.
1,48,Baljeet,"I was too excited to wait. (Takes off his wig) I shaved last night. Just call me Bald-jeet. Heh-heh. Get it? ""Bald-jeet""?"
1,48,Sergeant,"Okay, listen up, maggots! You are here because your parents (Mockingly) are worried about you. Now, the way I see it, the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination, fun, creativity and unbridled enthusiasm! Don't you eyeball me! Our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you and replace them with structure, order, discipline and conformity."
1,48,Sergeant,What--? (he looks over to see Phineas and Ferb doing something to their bunk bed) Whatcha doin'?
1,48,Phineas,"Oh, a few simple modifications. We call it the ""Ferris bed."" It makes trading off fair, simple and fun...(♪ carousel music) ...as well as giving easy access to the top bunk. All at the push of a button. Pretty cool, huh?"
1,48,Phineas,"You know, this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom."
1,48,Sergeant,"That's the idea! Now, make it shine!"
1,48,Sergeant,And no funky rhythms! (Leaves)
1,48,Phineas,"I thought it had more of a free-form jazz vibe. Huh. Well, you can't please everybody."
1,48,Candace,Oh! Ow-ow!
1,48,Stacy,What did you do?
1,48,Candace,I tripped over Ferb's old toolbox.
1,48,Stacy,"Well, do you wanna go horseback riding?"
1,48,Candace,"What's your hurry? Let's relax for a little while. You know, with Phineas and Ferb gone, I've had a blast doing things I wanted to do. But it's strange. I kind of miss the little guys. It's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that I never noticed before."
1,48,(Song,"""Little Brothers"")"
1,48,Candace,"Uh, Stace, you're kind of bumming me out with the song there."
1,48,Stacy,"You know, you finally have everything you ever wanted. Call me when you get over it. (leaves)"
1,48,Candace,Ok. Maybe a little TV will take my mind off things. (turns on the TV)
1,48,Morty Williams,"Today on ""The Morty Williams Show,"" ""My Kid Is Bad, and I Want to Blame Others!"" We'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school, where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. They are forced to think inside the box."
1,48,Candace,Wait a second. They didn't belong in a place like that. I know what I have to do.
1,48,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
1,48,Candace,Jeremy? How did you get in here?
1,48,Jeremy,There's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house.
1,48,Candace,"Oh, yeah, well, Phineas and Ferb would've usually fixed that by now."
1,48,Jeremy,You wanna go horseback riding?
1,48,Candace,Would you stop already with the horses? Jeremy! I know what I'm gonna do today! I'm gonna bust my brothers...
1,48,Jeremy,Didn't you already do that?
1,48,Candace,Out! Bust my brothers out!
1,48,Jeremy,Cool. I always liked your brothers. I'm coming with you.
1,48,Candace,"(gasps) You mean, like a date?"
1,48,Jeremy,Yeah. A weird sort of prison-break kind of date.
1,48,Recorded female voice,Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. Creative acts are imitable and dangerous. Using your imagination is morally wrong.
1,48,Baljeet,The book was so much better.
1,48,Linda,"Hmm. It's a letter from the board of selectmen. The city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter, and they need Phineas and Ferb's input."
1,48,Lawrence,(sighs) Perhaps we were a bit hard on them.
1,48,Linda,"Yeah, they really did believe they had permission. I suppose it was all a big misunderstanding."
1,48,Lawrence,"Well, let's go get 'em, shall we? We can take the Flying Car of the Future...Today."
1,48,Linda,Weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal?
1,48,Lawrence,"Yes, yes, but you must admit, it's pretty cool!"
1,48,Linda,"Yeah, it's pretty cool."
1,48,Lawrence,"Hey, where's the Flying Car of the Future...Today?"
1,48,Candace,Agh! Sorry. The Flying Car of the Future...Today is pulling a bit to the right.
1,48,Jeremy,Are you kidding? This is the best date ever.
1,48,Candace,(screaming laugh) Whoa-oa-oa!
1,48,Jeremy,Maybe we should walk the rest of the way.

1,48,Candace,"Um...uh, hi. Yeah, I'm here to see my brothers, Phineas and Ferb."
1,48,Sergeant,They don't graduate till the end of the summer. Get lost.
1,48,Candace,So much for the direct approach. It's time we tried it Phineas and Ferb style.
1,48,Jeremy,Is this gonna work?
1,48,Candace,"It's just like the Trojan horse from history class. They'll accept this as a gift, then after everyone falls asleep, we'll jump out and rescue Phineas and Ferb."
1,48,Sergeant,You two again? I thought I told you to get lost!
1,48,Candace,Maybe we gotta think bigger.
1,48,Sergeant,"Wow, what a thoughtful gift. Too bad I don't have room for you, handsome. I'm gonna have to get a bigger yard."

Fortunately, we got to them just in time. See for yourself. (to Phineas and Ferb) Flynn, Fletcher, fall in! (Phineas and Ferb come out of lockers, to Candace) You see, here at the Smile Away Reformatory, our motto is, ""It's structure, order and discipline today, so tomorrow it's Smile Away.""

1,48,Candace,We don't have time for this. Grab 'em!
1,48,Linda,Why is Morty Williams running off with our children?
1,48,Lawrence,I don't know.
1,48,Sergeant,"Attention, all personnel. Two students have escaped with the help of Morty Williams, syndicated daytime talk show host. Weekday mornings. Check local listings for time and channel. (dogs barking)"
1,48,Candace,"Come on, this way!"
1,48,Morty Williams,"Yep, it's time to go back inside the Smile Away Reformatory School for more footage. Those zombified brats are making me one rich - (shouting; dogs barking; barking continues)"

1,48,Candace,A bridge? You can build a bridge across the ravine!

1,48,Candace,"Great, great. Make me happy. Put on your helmet head systems, use your tools and do what you do best - build a bridge and Save Us!"
1,48,Phineas,Creative acts are imitable and dangerous.
1,48,Candace,"Listen to me, guys. Forget everything they told you. Creativity isn't bad. It's the best thing about you. (Sobbing) You two can do anything, and that's why I've always been secretly proud to be your older sister. What have I done?! What have I done?!"

I made this out of something that cannot be penetrated! Pure evil! And a blend of space-age polymers. You see, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to unleash the water held by this dam into that huge drainage pipe that leads directly to the ocean. The additional water will raise the sea level by 2%, and then my property one block from the shoreline will become beachfront property! (Laughs maniacally) And to release the water from the dam, I've invented a ray, which attracts wood like it attracts metal: The Wood-inator! Which was almost complete until you rudely interrupted me. Oh, look at this, Perry. It's my paintbrush. You know, the one you knocked out of my hand a few moments ago. Maybe you want to take it back from me now, huh? Huh, you want to try? (Laughs) Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! (Laughs maniacally)"

The second, is that he may be on his secret, hideout-shaped island with the initial ""D"" carved into it that satellites found in the exact, spot, where he... vanished... uh, you know what?

1,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? HERE? How could this be? I'm shocked. (walks over to a map of the ocean with his hideout on it) I mean, it would have taken a total evil mastermind to have guessed that you'd track me to this point, find the secret hide-out, glide in under the radar and infiltrate through this access vent, make your way over to this crate, activating my automatic arm and leg restraints. Right here? This is the part where I get all sarcastic and pretend you surprise me. ""OH, PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!? HOW? WHAT THE? WHO THE? WHY THE..."" Oh! ...Finally ending here, where I finish showing you my brilliant plan. You see Perry the Platypus, this secret hideout doesn't actually belong to me. It belonged to my mentor, Professor Destructicon, Kevin, to his friends. Sadly, he was just captured in the midst of his latest plan to set fire to the sun! Redundant, perhaps. But before they locked him away, Kevin asked a favor of me: To prevent them from discovering his hidden lair and all its secrets, would I please SET FIRE TO THE SUN! I was like, dude, you really got to let that one go, it's a ball of fire! It makes no sense. So he asked me instead to simply destroy his hide-out, which I will now do, using my new Disintevaporator. (Clears throat; Dramatic music) And you, Perry the Platypus, will now be disintevaporated along with it! (Laughs maniacally)"
1,39,Candace,"Okay, just breathe and relax. (Sighs) Let's try this again. Hi. Uh, Linda Flynn, please. But if she's too busy, uh, then maybe there's someone else who can deliver her a message. Maybe someone in their teens!"

Now, I'll just, uh, grab my keys to the escape jet, and, uh... Hmm. I could've sworn I put them in my lab coat. Oh, they're probably over here on the computer console...no. Ah, the kitchen. Hello? Keys? (Laughs) This is a little bit awkward, but have you seen my escape jet keys?"
1,39,Candace,"Oh, I can't believe it. I'm finally going to Jeremy's house. Okay, now, what would the perfect look be? (Gasps) I know: ""Girl next door meets pop diva meets Hollywood bad girl crossed with an old school glamor goddess""! (Crash) Now I just gotta find the finishing touch."

Now, though, he will be the one doing the waiting. Behold! The Now who'd blinded by sand-inator! Or maybe the Who's crying now-inator or, something like...something with the ""Inator"" suffix. In any case, it's a giant sand kicking machine! You see, Perry the Platypus, Boris has moved to the Tri-State Area, so now, I am going to cover his entire house in sand! (Laughs maniacally)"

1,14,Radio announcer,Call now.
1,14,Candace,"(after dialing the phone) Oh, it's busy! I've just gotta win. Clearly I'm your biggest fan. See, even my Betty boombox which rests on my Betty bedside table next to my Betty bed runs on Betty batteries."

1,14,"Candace, Stacy",EEEEEEEEE!!!!
1,14,Candace,"Imagine, a whole day of hanging with Crash and the band. And, as an added bonus, a whole day of not thinking about my goofy brothers. Just me, you and The Bettys! (horn honks) Ooh, they're here."
1,14,Lawrence,Bye. Enjoy your music concert.
1,14,Linda,Be careful.
1,14,Phineas,Have fun on your journey.
1,14,Candace,I can't believe we're about to board The Betty Bus.
1,14,Stacy,I bet the bus driver's gonna be a spaced-out rocker.
1,14,Dennis,"H-Hello, girls. My name is Dennis, and I'm with the radio station. (pig snorts) That is Sir Bacon, the band's mascot. According to our focus groups, girls your age overwhelmingly find that cool."

1,14,Crash,(British accent) Keep it down. We're trying to write a song.
1,14,Candace,Sure thing.
1,14,Stacy,"Oh, no problem."
1,14,Candace,"Oh, my gosh!"
1,14,Stacy,It's The Betty Bass Guitar!
1,14,Candace,"I know, I know..."
1,14,Crash,"Check this out. (at Candace and Stacy) So tell me, girls, would you like to be part of the music-making process and help us write a song?"
1,14,Candace,"Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh."
1,14,"Stacy, Candace",Would we?
1,14,Crash,"Great. First, we can't possibly write a song in this filth, so you girls can start by cleanin' up the bus. Here you go."
1,14,Phineas,"All right, Ferb, what should we do today? One - an escalator to the moon? Two - become secret agents? Three - clone giant hamsters. Hey, where's Perry? Huh. I wonder where he goes when we can't find him. What the...? Some sort of secret room? Wow. What in the world? A secret underground headquarters with a particle disruptor and, oh, a hovercraft. Looks like we're gonna be secret agents, huh? When did you find the time to build all this, Ferb?"
1,14,Ferb,"Actually, I –"
1,14,Major Monogram,"Hello, Agent P. Hang on. It's here somewhere on this clipboard from which I have yet to look up."
1,14,Phineas,"Agent P. P for Phineas. Nice touch, Ferb."
1,14,Ferb,Actually -
1,14,Major Monogram,"Ah, yes, here it is. Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Huh, what a surprise. Building some sort of destructo ray. End of the world. Yada, yada, yada. I'm faxing you the coordinates."
1,14,Phineas,Cool.
1,14,Major Monogram,"Good googly-moogly! Do... Carl. Carl, who are those kids?"
1,14,Carl,"Oh, boy. They're Agent P's owners, sir. Looks like they found one of our secret tunnels."
1,14,Phineas,"Sweet. We got our mission, Agent F. To the hover jet."
1,14,Major Monogram,"Is that the hover jet? Oh, no, they didn't! (at Perry) There you are, Agent P. Those boys are in jeopardy and not covered under our hover jet insurance plan, so, stop Doofenshmirtz and protect those boys. (at Carl) Oh, and where are you going, Mr. The Boys Will Never Find A Tree Tunnel?"
1,14,Phineas,"Wow... Laser beam, magnet ray, cup holder. You really thought of everything, Ferb."
1,14,Ferb,Actually –
1,14,Phineas,Hold that thought. The Bettys' tour bus. Candace is on there. We should go say hi.
1,14,Candace,We're all done cleaning the bus.
1,14,Crash,"Oh, we can't get to our song till we deal with our fan mail. Think you could help?"
1,14,Stacy,"Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh..."
1,14,Missy,Great. You can start with this bag.
1,14,Tink,(British accent) And here's the shredder.
1,14,Stacy,Check this one out.
1,14,Candace,"Ahem. ""Beloved Bettys, your band is the biggest, baddest, most bangin' buncha -"" Hey, this is my letter. They didn't even read it."
1,14,Stacy,"Yeah, but don't forget - we are on the bus helping the band write a song."
1,14,Candace,"Yeah, I guess you're right. And you know what the best part is? I haven't even thought about my brothers the whole day. (She sees her brothers out the window.) Stacy, look, it's my brothers!"
1,14,Stacy,Huh? I don't see anything.
1,14,Candace,B-But I could've sworn I –
1,14,Stacy,I think the cleaning supplies are starting to get to you.
1,14,Candace,That must be it. That's gotta be. I'm not even gonna look.
1,14,Major Monogram,(voice over) Stop Doofenshmirtz. Protect the boys. Stop Doofenshmirtz. Protect the boys.
1,14,Doofenshmirtz,"(hums) Ah, nothing like a nice snack before testing the Destructinator. Aah! Hey, Perry the Platypus, why do you always go for the nose?"
1,14,Candace,Here you go.
1,14,Stacy,"All 250,000 letters opened and shredded."
1,14,Tink,"I just thought of something. The outside of this bus is dirty, too."
1,14,Candace,"You know, Stacy, I'm beginning to think that The Bettys have just been taking advantage of us this whole time."
1,14,Stacy,What are you talking about? They've been nothing but... Look out! ...nice to us since we got on the bus.
1,14,Doofenshmirtz,"Heh-heh. My automatic tennis ball server can go all night, Perry the Plat-"

1,14,Phineas,"Wow, Ferb, this evil villain lair is awesome. I see you carved it out with dynamite. Nice. Aw, cool, you got an automatic tennis ball server. Sweet."
1,14,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, what's going on, Perry the Platypus? (muffled speech)"
1,14,Candace,"We're finished washing the outside of the bus. It nearly killed us, but we're finished!"
1,14,Crash,"Great work, girls. You've earned a special ""surprise."""
1,14,Stacy,Really?
1,14,Missy,You get to scrub the toilets.
1,14,Candace,What?
1,14,Stacy,"Yay, toilets! They're so much fun to scrub!"
1,14,Tink,And be sure to get underneath the lid.
1,14,Candace,"Ah, that is it. We're through being your tour monkeys. Right, Stace?"
1,14,Stacy,"Yay, a Betty Bowl Brush!"
1,14,Candace,"You've just been using us this whole trip. Is this how you treat your fans? It should be your fans that inspire you to make music. If you can't see that by now, then drop me off at the next Betty Bus Stop."
1,14,Crash,"Unfortunately, guys, she's right."
1,14,Tink,I feel like a bit of a Betty butt-head.
1,14,Crash,We're sorry for treating you so bad. How can we ever make it up to you?
1,14,Missy,I'll let you bang my Betty Bongos.
1,14,Tink,Or play my Betty Bass Guitar.

1,14,Crash,Perfect. That rocks.
1,14,Dennis,"Hey, girls, what's goin' on?"
1,14,Candace,"We just helped the Bettys write - Wait a second. Dennis, if you're here, then who's driving the bus?"
1,14,Dennis,"Oh, come on, I'll show you. Autopilot."
1,14,"Stacy, Candace","Wow, cool."
1,14,Phineas,"By the way, I love that giant ray gun counting down to zero. OK, seriously, when did you make all this?"
1,14,Ferb,"Look, for the last time, I didn't –"
1,14,Candace,He fainted.
1,14,Stacy,Aah!
1,14,Candace,"Aah! Unh, unh. There's something wrong with the Betty Brakes, and I can't stop the autopilot."

1,14,Phineas,"Agent F, let's head home."
1,14,Crash,"Way to go, Candace. Now we are your biggest fan. How can we thank you?"
1,14,Candace,"Well, you can come to my house and clean up my room."
1,14,Candace,I'm serious.
1,14,Crash,How about you sing with us onstage instead?

1,14,Linda,"Oh, what a great day. Not one phone call from Candace with some crazy, unbelievable story –"
1,14,Phineas,"Mom, guess what Ferb did. He made a secret tunnel and a spy headquarters and a villain's lair and a hover jet shaped like Perry. Tell her, Ferb."
1,14,Ferb,"Actually, I – !"
1,14,Linda,Wait a second. Why are you two soaking wet?
1,14,Ferb,Ach! I give up! (stomps off)
1,14,Phineas,We fell in Isabella's pool.

1,15,Vanessa,Dad! Why did you pick up? You always let the machine get it!

1,15,Vanessa,"Great. Now he wants me to pick up some evil blueprints for his latest evil contraption. And as soon as he's done building it, I'll have proof! I'll call you, and you can see for yourself."
1,15,Worker,"So, you need plans to build a giant sundae maker, do you? Hmm, I'm not sure if we sell blueprints for that anymore. Whoa! Hold on, sweetie. No need to get upset. I'll go check in the back, okay? Okay. Let's see. Giant sundae machine. I got a yogurt machine! How's that sound? Yeah, I don't care for yogurt either, baby. I'll keep looking. You're in luck. I found one! Now, what do you need, sweetie?"
1,15,Vanessa,I'm here to pick up an order for Doofenshmirtz.

1,15,Major Monogram,"Sorry to wake you, Agent P. Looks like Doofenshmirtz is getting sloppy. He sent his daughter right into our sting operation and purchased blueprints for a Space Las-inator. We intend to pass him fake plans, but due to a rookie error, and by ""rookie"", I mean Carl."
1,15,Carl,"Sorry, my bad."

1,29,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! (They come back with sandwiches from Sandwich Town) You know what else we should do today? Go search for a caveman at the Danville Glacier!"
1,29,Candace,"(Trying on different costumes) Oh, I've got to find the perfect outfit to wear to Stacy's costume party. That's it! A disco diva! Nah. A corn dog! Nah. I know! I'll ask Jeremy! (Talking to a photo of Jeremy taped on top of a teddybear) What do you think about my costumes, Jeremy? (As Jeremy) Gee, Candace, I think you look beautiful and everything. Will you be my girlfriend? (Cell phone rings) (As herself) Oh, yes, Jeremy! I will be your girlfriend! (Ringing continues) What? The prom? (At phone) What?!"
1,29,Jeremy,"Uh, Candace?"
1,29,Candace,"(As Jeremy) No-- Uh, just a minute, please. (Clears throat) Hi, Jeremy!"
1,29,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. Are you going to Stacy's party?"
1,29,Candace,Yes.
1,29,Jeremy,Cool. It's gonna be wicked. I'm going as a caveman. I'll see you there.
1,29,Candace,"(Giggles) Bye, Jeremy! (She hangs up) Ghee! It's perfect! I'll dress up like a cavewoman, and Jeremy and I will be all matchy, and it'll be like we're on a date! (She laughs excitedly, throwing clothes)"
1,29,Phineas,"Okay, let's go over our checklist."
1,29,Lawrence,"Well, boys, we're off to the Center for Historically Relevant Botanical Gardens, a virtual treasure trove of topical topiaries."
1,29,Linda,I'm sure it'll be riveting. What are you boys doing today?
1,29,Phineas,Archaeological dig!
1,29,Linda,Okay. Don't touch the flower beds.
1,29,Phineas,"Wouldn't think of it!  Hey, where's Perry?"
1,29,Major Monogram,"(Chuckles) Oh, there you are, Agent P. (Chuckles) Carl, he fell for it! (Chuckles)"
1,29,Major Monogram,"We were just kidding about the whole magpie costume. (Perry rips off beak) Anyway, Doofenshmirtz is up to something. Seek out that wild-eyed miscreant and found out what he's up to."
1,29,Carl,Ooh! Tell him to do it dressed as a rabbit!
1,29,Major Monogram,"Ooh, and Agent P, could– Could you do it dressed as a... Bunny? (He laughs)"
1,29,Carl,"Good one, sir."
1,29,Major Monogram,A big pink bunny.
1,29,Candace,Wait till Jeremy sees how hot I am in my smokin' cave girl outfit. (Her phone ringing and she picks it up) Ooga-booga!
1,29,Stacy,"Hi, it's Stace. Do you think you could bring a sandwich platter to the party?"
1,29,Candace,"Sure! Ooh, I'll brink roast beef! Jeremy eats roast beef on Phinedays and Saturferbs. (Yelling at Phineas and Ferb who passed by her door) Phineas and Ferb, you're lustin' for a bustin'"
1,29,Stacy,Candace! Forget your brothers! Remember? Jeremy.
1,29,Candace,"Right. Jeremy. Sandwiches. True love, your house. Bye!"
1,29,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, let's scout around and see what's what. All right, let's see... Jurassic, Cretaceous, Plasticine... Oh, here's Paleolithic, down here on the end."
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable. You're just in time, though, to watch me rid the Tri-State Area of one of my biggest pet peeves: People who dress as sandwiches to promote restaurants. (Pictures of said people flash on screen) You see? You see what I mean? What is this? Are you a person or are you a food? For some reason, I don't mind the taco guy so much. Look at his cute little hat. Anyway, the whole thing sickens me to no end, which is why I created the Sandwich Remove-Inator It sucks all sandwich suits up into the air and then shreds them to teensy, weensy pieces. Today I will fly all over the city and strip anyone dressed as a sandwich right down to their skivvies! (He laughs crazily) Ugh... I've become my mother."
1,29,Candace,"(Looking into a mirror) ♪ Ooh, oh, yeah After Jeremy sees me lookin' so fly ♪"
1,29,Candace,"Oh, hi, Stacy! Yes, sandwiches. I'm on it!"
1,29,Phineas,"This will be fantastic! Think of all the practical applications a caveman can have in the modern world. (Pause) Actually, you know, besides politics, I can't think of anything. (Phineas turns on hair dryer, and begins melting the ice) But wait till he says what we've done with the wheel, and fire, and shiny objects."
1,29,Caveman,Me Conk.
1,29,Phineas,"Me Phineas, he Ferb."
1,29,Conk,Conk hungry. Food! (He runs off)
1,29,Phineas,"Oh no, Conk! That's a carburet... or."
1,29,Conk,(Chewing on carburetor)
1,29,Phineas,"Uh, seriously, Conk, me go to kitchen for food, while you wait here with Ferb. Wow. Not a very sophisticated palate."
1,29,Conk,Ahh...
1,29,Candace,"♪ Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, uh-huh, uh-huh ♪"
1,29,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. You think you could spare a sandwich?"
1,29,Candace,"Well, I'm sure I can spare one. I know how men are about their meat. ""Argh! Me manly man! Me like meat!"""
1,29,Phineas,"Gee, uh, thanks, sis. Cool outfit, by the way. You should meet our new friend. He's a real Neanderthal."
1,29,Candace,"I don't care how buff he is. Me, hang out with one of your friends? Puh-leeze. Now run along before I take my sandwich back. And if you even think about trying something funny today, you're gonna get it!"
1,29,Phineas,Get what?
1,29,Candace,It!
1,29,Phineas,"Well, if ""it"" is another sandwich, I'll take it now, please."
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,"At last, my efforts have come to fruition! And nothing can stop me! (Turns on Sandwich Remove-Inator, Sputters) Hmm. (He walks out, and returns with a gas nozzle) I told Vanessa if she takes out the big head, she has to fill it up. (Doofenshmirtz fills the -inator) Ah, yes. All zeroes make it so much easier to balance my check-- Perry the Platypus, are you asleep? (He groans) Sometimes I wonder why I even bother to soliloquize. Where was I? At last-- Well, you remember the rest. (Doofenshmirtz flies out)"
1,29,Phineas,"Hey, guys, good news. I got refreshments!"
1,29,Phineas,A little something to wash it down?
1,29,Phineas,"I guess we'd be hungry, too, if we hadn't eaten in 28,000 years. Come on, Ferb. Let's go wrangle up some snacks for our new pal. (To Conk) You stay put, and we'll be back."
1,29,Candace,"(Walking by the garage) ♪ Happy, happy sandwich man ♪"
1,29,Conk,Sandwiches! (He follows after Candace)
1,29,Phineas,"Good news! We got a plethora of sandwiches for ya! (Phineas sees that Conk is no longer there) Um, Conk? Uh oh."
1,29,Candace,"Jeremy? Is that you? Wow, great costume! I hardly recognize you."
1,29,Stacy,"Yay! it's Candace, and..."
1,29,Candace,And Jeremy!
1,29,Stacy,And you guys are all matchy!
1,29,Candace,Yeah.
1,29,Stacy,"Hey, everybody, Candace and Jeremy are here!"
1,29,Boy dressed as a robot,"Jeremy, dude! Sweet costume, bro!"
1,29,Conk,(Punches him)
1,29,Boy,"Okay, you're not my bro!"
1,29,Stacy,"Come on, let's dance!"
1,29,Candace,"Ooh, I love this song! Dance with me, Jeremy!"
1,29,Candace,"(Fake laugh) Yeah, he really hates techno."
1,29,Conk,(Sniffs) Food! (Chewing)
1,29,Candace,"Hey, Jeremy, isn't this a great party? (Conk grabs her by the waist, and picks her up) Jeremy, you're so primitive. Woo!"
1,29,Stacy,Candace...
1,29,Candace,Hold that thought. (Picks up phone) Hello?
1,29,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. Sorry I'm running late, but I just finished getting ready."
1,29,Candace,"Yeah, you look amazing! Wait, what?"
1,29,Jeremy,See ya soon.
1,29,Stacy,Who was that?
1,29,Candace,J-J-J-J--
1,29,Stacy,Huh? I don't know a J-J-J-J.
1,29,Candace,But if that was... then who–
1,29,Phineas,(As a memory) You should meet our new friend. He's a real Neanderthal. (Neanderthal echoes)
1,29,Candace,"Ooh, Phineas and Ferb are behind this! (Speed dial) Mom!"
1,29,Linda,(On the line with Candace) Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Okay.
1,29,Lawrence,"So, what is it this time?"
1,29,Linda,She says they have a real caveman.
1,29,Lawrence,"Well, you can say what you like about Candace, but there's nothing primitive about her imagination."
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, well, well, what do you know? A hapless sandwich man. Prepare to be eaten by the Remove-Inator!"
1,29,Man,Mother of mayonnaise!
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,Yes! It is functioning properly! Oh no! Perry the Platy-- Oof!
1,29,Candace,"I demand you let me go, you-- You-- Friend of Phineas and Ferb!"
1,29,Candace,"When my Mom gets here, you're gonna be in big trouble."
1,29,Phineas,"There you are, Conk. Looky kooky! (Ferb holds up a sandwich platter)"
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,Oof!
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,"I got you know, Perry the Platy– Oof! (He falls off) Curse you, Perry the Platy– Oof!"
1,29,Phineas,"There you go, Conky. There you go."
1,29,Doofenshmirtz,(Now in the sandwich costume that fell from his -inator) Ugh... What smells like mustard? Huh? (He screams)
1,29,Conk,That big sandwich!
1,29,Phineas,"Well, I guess we can't compete with a sandwich like that."
1,29,Phineas,"They say if you love something, let it go."
1,29,Ferb,Especially if it's a caveman.
1,29,Phineas,Yeah. Especially if it's a caveman.
