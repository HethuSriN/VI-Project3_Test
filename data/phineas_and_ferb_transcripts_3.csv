3,27,Lawrence,"Goodbye boys, have a great day, I'm off to work."
3,27,Phineas,"Goodbye dad, have fun buying from auctions and private sales performing minor refurbishments to the purchase items, marking up the price and then selling them to your customers!"
3,27,Ferb,(To the camera) Our dad sells antiques.
3,27,Phineas,"You know Ferb, it's strange how we wave our hands when we say goodbye. It seems so arbitrary. Why don't people jump up and down or stick out their tongues, or slap their thighs?"
3,27,Phineas,"Well, if by that you mean we should create a whole new form of communication, then I couldn't agree more! That was some nice gesturing, Ferb. Do some more!"
3,27,Phineas,"Ah. I...know...what...we're...going...to do...spatula! Oh, today...I really should have known that from the context."
3,27,Phineas,"Oh, here's another one! Hey...where's...spatula! Oh, context again..."
3,27,Major Monogram,"Ah Agent P. Sorry I'm running a little late this morning. Our satellites haven't picked up any Inator activity coming from Doofenshmirtz, but that's no indication that he isn't up to something. We want you to get down there and have a little look-see. Good hunting Agent P."
3,27,Phineas,"Finally when someone sneezes rather than say gesundheit, just play flugelhorn and give him your left shoe. I think we nailed down the non-verbal cues. Now let's look at the syntax!"
3,27,Linda,"Candace? What's wrong, honey?"
3,27,Candace,"Mom, they're doing stuff out there!"
3,27,Linda,"(looks at the boys) Candace, they're just writing on a whiteboard."
3,27,Candace,"Yes, that's it, they're plotting. And you know what that leads to. Implementing-guh!"
3,27,Linda,"Candace, you need to lighten up a little. Take it easy. Do you know what I do to relax?"
3,27,Candace,You eat some pie and then laid down on that old sensory deprivation tank we keep in the basement.
3,27,Linda,That's right! Would you like to try it?
3,27,Candace,"Um, I'm gonna go with no, but thank you."
3,27,Linda,Well you should still try to relax.
3,27,Candace,"Mom, I don't need to relax, I need to bust Phineas and Ferb."
3,27,Linda,"Well listen sweetie, you said so yourself, they're just plotting, right? That gives you plenty of time to go to the mall before they start implementing-guh. (makes hand gestures)"
3,27,Candace,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! Maybe—Hey, wait a second, are you making fun of me?"
3,27,Linda,Maybe just a little. (leaves)
3,27,Candace,"She's right, I probably have plenty of time to go to the mall!"
3,27,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, let's start implementing!"
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(adjusting something on Norm's back) Just one more bolt right behind- (Perry♪) So, Perry the Platypus, we meet again! But this time, the advantage is mine... (to Norm) Hey, what are you waiting for Norm, we rehearsed this like a thousand times! I say ""Ah, Perry the Platypus, we meet again, only this time the advantage is mine"", you go and get him!"
3,27,Norm,Going and getting!
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(writing) Note to self, say the --- for replacing Norm's head. (Norm captures Perry in a bag) Okay, much better (to Perry) this is a good look for you!"
3,27,Isabella,Hi guys. Whatcha doin'?
3,27,Phineas,Erb-Ferb Atin-Lerb!
3,27,Isabella,"Oh, creating a whole new form of communication today, are we?"
3,27,Phineas,"Yeah, what do you think?"
3,27,Isabella,Sounds fun! What do you call it?
3,27,Phineas,"Ferb Latin! Where you take the first letter of every word, move it to the end, and then you say erb! So Ferb becomes erb-ferb, and Latin becomes atin-lerb! Two letter words stay the same, like or stays or. All the fun of Pig Latin, and it's safe for vegetarians to use!"
3,27,Isabella,"Oh, Phineas, I think your new language is onderful-werb!"
3,27,Phineas,"By Jove, I think she's got it! But there's also a lot of non-verbal cues! For example, if you wanna say okay, you reach for the sky!"
3,27,Buford,"Yeah! And when you're hungry, you crack your knuckles! (cracks knuckles) Oh, baby, that's good..."
3,27,Phineas,"And if you smell something bad, you do jazz hands!"
3,27,Baljeet,"(to Buford) Stop looking at me, I'm not going to do jazz hands! Even though you have totally earned it..."
3,27,Isabella,How do you say goodbye?
3,27,Phineas,"When you say goodbye, you blow a raspberry! (blows a raspberry) Let's all do it!"
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"I bet you're wondering where my Inator is, right? C'mon, guess? Guess, no? No? Can I get a play-Oh alright ergh alright. Don't play. It's Norm!"
3,27,Norm,Let's hope there's no self-destruct button on this one!
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"You've always had one, Norm. I just never told you where it was so you wouldn't pick at it!"
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"And stop interrupting me! Anyway, I've done a lot of research for the past... you know, few hours... and I, and I found that most people will believe anything they read! And I know it's true, 'cause you know... I read it online somewhere. So, my new weapon to take over the Tri-State Area is... propaganda!"
3,27,Norm,Propaganda consists of messages that dishonestly attempt to influence the attitude of a community!
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Thanks for that, Mr. Norm-It-All. I've installed a switch back here that prints out propaganda leaflets. All I have to do is speak my evil messages into this microphone, err let's see... eh, ""slap yourself""! Push this button and, whatever I say (presses button and leaflet comes out) comes printed out on a leaflet. It's gonna work! I'm using a very convincing font. It's bold and it has a lot of serifs!"
3,27,Norm,Serifs are semi-structural details that...
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"(cuts off Norm) Oh, for crying out loud, Norm! Listen, here's a buck, why don't you go get out of here and get a haircut or something!"
3,27,Norm,Out I go! (Going with Perry still in hand)
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, Norm, take the dollar and leave the platypus.(He hands Norm the dollar, who puts Perry on the floor then walks out right through the wall) And when you come back use the door! (to Perry) He gets that from you, you know. Anyway, my plan is to fly Norm all over the Tri-State Area and drop leaflets, then everyone will do my bidding!"
3,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Man, that really is a convincing font."
3,27,Ice cream guy,"Hi, kids, what'll it be?"
3,27,Phineas,Ocolate-Cherb.
3,27,Isabella,Awberry-Strerb.
3,27,Baljeet,Anilla-Verb.
3,27,Buford,Emon-Lerb.
3,27,Ferb,Erry-Cherb.
3,27,Ice cream guy,Are you kids from outta town?
3,27,Phineas,"No no no, we're speaking Ferb Latin! You move the first letter to the end of the word then add erb! One and two letter words stay the same."
3,27,Ice cream guy,"Oh, I get it! Ocolate-Cherb is chocolate, and anilla-verb is vanilla!"
3,27,Random Woman,"Ooh, at's-therb ute-cerb."
3,27,Random Woman,Did..that mean goodbye?
3,27,Ice cream guy,I'm gonna borrow it.
3,27,Woman,Are you having trouble relaxing?
3,27,Candace,A little...
3,27,Woman,Try our new liquid massage. This isn't your mother's sensory deprivation tank. A few minutes in here will change your world!
3,27,Candace,"Alright, strap me in!"
3,27,Barber 1,Ice-nerb adge-berb.
3,27,Customer,Es-yerb it is.
3,27,Norm,"Hey, what's that language they're speaking?"
3,27,Barber 2,That is Ferb Latin!
3,27,Norm,I like it! And intend to use it whenever I can. Tell me how it works.
3,27,News-anchor,"Hey, I hear you kids have invented a new language. Tell us all about it!"
3,27,Phineas,"Sure, follow me!"

3,27,Candace,What is this? I am losing it!
3,27,News-anchor,(on TV) And how did this latest cultural craze get started? We talked to the creators.
3,27,Candace,This whole town has gone crazy!
3,27,Phineas,"(on TV) Ferb Latin isn't just a language, it's a way of life!"
3,27,Candace,Ferb Latin? I should have known Phineas and Ferb were behind this! (to the boys on TV) You are so usted-berb!
3,27,Linda,"What is it Candace? (Candace asks something) No, I don't know what Ferb Latin is. (sighs) Give me fifteen minutes."

3,27,Woman,"Yeah, okay, I'm convinced."
3,27,Candace,"Mom mom mom! Come with me. Phineas and Ferb created a new language and everybody's speaking it, and now we can't understand anybody! Watch this! What time is it?"
3,27,Woman,Twenty minutes since the last time you asked me.
3,27,Candace,What? You there! Talk!
3,27,Man,I don't think we have anything to say to each other! Not after the... jazz hands!
3,27,Linda,"Wow, he must really hate jazz hands."
3,27,Candace,I don't get it! Everybody was blowing raspberries and speaking this crazy language!
3,27,Linda,Look who's here.

3,33,Candace,"Oooooh! Here he comes! Oh, Jeremy. How can you even make walking to a bus stop cute? Yeah, I'm a lucky, lucky gal. (a strange object falls from Jeremy's backpack) Oh, no! He dropped something! Jeremy! Jeremy! (runs outside) Jeremy, wait! You dropped-- (bus leaves) wait! (calls Jeremy on her cellphone) Jeremy, you dropped something outside my house, and it kind of looks, uh, artsy."
3,33,Jeremy,Sounds like the gift I made you.
3,33,Candace,Gift? Well you didn't have to make--
3,33,Jeremy,Well we're passing the antenna farm. I'm losing you.
3,33,Woman,My fillings are heating up.
3,33,Candace,"Jeremy? Jeremy? (groans) Oh, what a beautiful tiara... neck, uh, broach... hmm... bracelet! (gasps) Oh, it's absolutely beautiful! (flings it into the sewer) Oops! No! No! No! No! (reaches for the object) Almost got it... (water rushes in and carries the object away)"

3,33,Man 2,A million gallons straight to the ocean!
3,33,Candace,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Jeremy will be heartbroken when he finds out I lost my gift! Phineas and Ferb! (runs into the backyard) Hey. What are you guys doing?"
3,33,Phineas,We built a mind machine to enter Baljeet's subconscious in order to cure his fear of contractions.
3,33,Baljeet,You are amputating two perfectly good words and stitching them together. They are the Frankenstein monsters of grammar.
3,33,Phineas,We've already cured Irving's fear of the color lavender.
3,33,Irving,It can't hurt me anymore.
3,33,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about any of that! I lost the gift Jeremy made for me, and you guys have to make an exact duplicate of it before he comes over!"
3,33,Phineas,We'd love to. What'd it look like?
3,33,Candace,"Well it kind of had this bolty screwy thing going on, and this wrapped wire like... Oh, I know what it looked like, but I don't know how to describe it!"
3,33,Phineas,"No problem. We can use the mind machine to enter your subconscious and retrieve your memory of what the gift looked like. You don't mind if we fix Candace's problem first, do you, Baljeet?"
3,33,Baljeet,"No, I don't (shudders) Chills! Chills! Hey where's (shudders) where is Perry?"
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,"♪ Eating cereal looks like this! ♪ (Perry enters the building) Ah! Perry the Platypus! You're early, and I'm in my underwear. So embarrassing. And it's the pair of underwear you never want anyone to see you in too. You know the ones. They're faded and frayed, and the elastic is so worn out you have to hold them up while you're  walking around the house. And you have to roll up the waist band, making your pants look all lumpy. And, and yet when you take them off, you find yourself mysteriously putting them in the hamper rather than the garbage. Why- why do you do that? Hey, where are you going Perry the Platypus?! (traps Perry in a net) You know, when you showed up, despite appearances, I was trying to come up with a perfect evil plan to thwart today's Tri-State Area Summit and Weenie Roast, and you just gave me a great idea! What is a man most afraid of? It's being in public and suddenly realizing he's in his underwear! So, I shall construct an Underwear-inator! One blast at the summit, and everyone will be so paralyzed with fear and embarrassment, I can just waltz in and take over. Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Thank you very much!"
3,33,Phineas,"Alright, Candace. You're all wired up. We're ready to go in."
3,33,Candace,Wait a minute. Why is that dweeb going into my subconscious?
3,33,Baljeet,Because this dweeb spent two weeks in psychology camp last summer.
3,33,All,How does that make you feel?
3,33,Candace,"Alright, but don't forget about doctor-patient confidentiality."
3,33,Phineas,"Okay, Irving. We're in your hands now."
3,33,Irving,Close your eyes and count backwards from four.
3,33,All,Three...two...one...
3,33,Candace,Where are we?
3,33,Phineas,We're inside your subconscious.
3,33,Candace,"Okay, everyone take off your shoes. I don't want you tracking mud in here, metaphorically speaking."
3,33,Irving,Mindmaster calling Deep Divers. How you guys doing?
3,33,Phineas,"We're doing fine, Irving."
3,33,Irving,"Remember, you have 45 minutes to retrieve the memory before the boyfriend arrives."
3,33,Phineas,"Copy that, Mindmaster. We need to get to the Forest of Memory."
3,33,Candace,So where are we now?
3,33,Phineas,"Offhand, I'd say the Jeremy Mountains."
3,33,Baljeet,"Hmm, significant."
3,33,Candace,"Uh, what was that?"
3,33,Phineas,Baljeet?
3,33,Baljeet,Shh! Do not move a muscle.
3,33,Candace,What is it?
3,33,Baljeet,It is your id.
3,33,Candace,My what?
3,33,Baljeet,"Your id. The embodiment of your deepest, most primal urges."
3,33,Candace,"So, fun, right?"
3,33,Baljeet,"Wrong. It is very primitive and aggressive. We do not want to meet it here. (shows gazelles that look like Phineas and Ferb running away from the id) Obviously, you see Phineas and Ferb as some sort of prey."
3,33,Candace,Run!
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Almost ready, Perry the Platypus, just a few more adjustments. I'm putting an extra ratty setting on the Underwear-inator. So embarrassing! (Perry takes a contact lenses out of his eye and holds it up to the light and tries to cut through the net)"
3,33,Irving,"Calling Phineas and Ferb. Come in, Phineas and Ferb. What's your 20?"
3,33,Phineas,"We copy you, Irving. We're just emerging from the Peaks and Valleys of Fickleness."
3,33,Candace,I have mixed feelings about it.
3,33,Phineas,"Wow, the Falls of Anxiety."
3,33,Falls of Anxiety,Is my neck to long? Is it okay that I wear the same dress everyday? (The falls continues to voice Candace's anxieties)
3,33,Candace,What's that?
3,33,Baljeet,It is all of Candace's anxieties.
3,33,Phineas,There are so... many of them.
3,33,Ferb,She has a rich internal life.
3,33,Buford,"Yeah, she's real messed up."

3,33,Candace,Rubber ducks?
3,33,Baljeet,Do not ask me! It is your subconscious!
3,33,Buford,"Yeah, I'll catch yous later. I'm keeping my hoagie dry."
3,33,Isabella,"Hey, Buford."
3,33,Buford,"Hey, Isabella. You just get here?"
3,33,Isabella,Yep.
3,33,Buford,Let me show you around. This place is a riot!
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,"(sniffs) Do you smell something burning? What are you doing?! Give me that! Got it! What is this, a tiny magnifying glass?

3,33,Phineas,"Here we are Candace, the Forest of Memory."
3,33,Candace,How will we find Jeremy's gift?
3,33,Phineas,"Well, we shouldn't have to walk too far since it's a recent memory. What's the last thing you remember?"
3,33,Candace,"Hmm... the last thing I remember is saying, ""How will we find Jeremy's gift?"""
3,33,Phineas,Well we shouldn't have to walk too far since it's a recent memory. What's the last thing you remember?
3,33,Candace,"Oh, I forgot it already."
3,33,Phineas,No problem. This should be deep enough. Everybody just feel around. Maybe we can stimulate Candace's memory.
3,33,Candace,"That makes my head all buzzy. Wait, wait a minute, wait! I'm remembering! Yes, yes, I see it! Over there, through the trees! That's it!"
3,33,Jeremy,That's what?
3,33,Candace,"Jeremy? Wait, are you real?"
3,33,Jeremy,Yeah. I stopped by your house to give your present and Irving just told me to jack right in.
3,33,Candace,My present? How could you? I lost it. But I found the memory. It's right over there.
3,33,Jeremy,That? That's not your present. That's my drain unclogger. I don't know why I carry that around with me.
3,33,Candace,So I didn't lose your-- (id comes in and roars)
3,33,Baljeet,That is the id! Run!
3,33,Buford,"And if you follow me now, you'll see Candace's recurring nightmares. Come on, people. Try and stay with the group. (they see everyone running from the id) Hey, where are they going? (he sees the id and screams)"
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,"(as Perry escapes from the trap) Ironic, I built my Underwear-inator while actually in my underwear. Ha! (Perry attacks him and the Underwear-inator fires up)"
3,33,Id,(as children are running away from it) Clubby Momo!
3,33,Buford,"You all signed the releases, right?"
3,33,Id,Phineas and Ferb!
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,Ow! (Underwear-inator hits Perry) Ha! You look ridic-- (Underwear-inator hits Doofenshmirtz) Ah! Moth holes?!
3,33,Norm,Who wants lobster bisque? (Underwear-inator hits him) Get it while it's hot! (Perry disassembles the Underwear-inator)
3,33,Phineas,Irving! Get us out of here now!
3,33,Irving,"Roger, over! (Underwear-inator hits him) Ahh! Lavender! Ahh! It had to be lavender!"
3,33,Phineas,Hello? Irving? Hello?
3,33,Doofenshmirtz,"(as Perry is disassembling the Underwear-inator) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! You know, those, those really work for you."
3,33,Baljeet,I cannot believe I turned down a trip to the community pool for this!
3,33,Candace,She's growing! What do we do?
3,33,Phineas,One of us has to wake up and extract the others!
3,33,Baljeet,"I am trying to wake up, but I can't! Ahh! Oh! I feel a shock!"
3,33,Phineas,That's it! Let's all shock Baljeet awake with contractions!
3,33,Candace,Isn't!
3,33,Isabella,Won't!
3,33,Phineas,It's! Don't!
3,33,Isabella,Hasn't!
3,33,All,Ain't!
3,33,Baljeet,Ahh! That is both a contraction and grammatically incorrect! Ahh! (he wakes up)
3,33,Irving,(running around in circles) Lavender! Had to be lavender!
3,33,Baljeet,The... wires... must... pull... them... out... with... no muscles.
3,33,Candace,I don't think I can run anymore!
3,33,Phineas,Don't give up! Baljeet will save us!

3,33,Ginger,That's it! I'm dead meat!

3,33,Candace,I'm really complicated and weird. (everyone gets eaten by the id and wakes up)
3,33,Ginger,That was great! Let's do it again!
3,33,Irving,Not me!

3,33,Baljeet,Wait until they hear about this at psychology camp!
3,33,Phineas,Goodbye everybody!
3,33,Candace,"Wow, I guess that was a lot of trouble to go through for a drain unclogger."
3,33,Jeremy,"Yeah, by the way, here's your real gift. (hands Candace a bracelet)"
3,33,Candace,"Jeremy, it's beautiful! I really love it. Thank you. Wait, hold on. Where's Buford?"
3,33,Buford,(to id) I don't care what Freud said about your selfish need for satisfaction. You're alright with me.
3,1,Phineas,"(offscreen) Hey, Ferb. What'cha wanna do today?"
3,1,Phineas,"(offscreen) Oops! (his hand comes in to pick it up.) It's way to nice out to be lying down. (Zoom out; they are in the living room, it is raining outside.) At least...in here, it is."
3,1,Phineas,Come in!
3,1,Isabella,(Sad voice) Hey Phineas. What'cha doin'?
3,1,Phineas,"Oh, what's the matter?"
3,1,Isabella,"(Sighs) We were going to go for our desert trekking patch today, but now it's raining."
3,1,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
3,1,Candace,"You see, I know Jeremy likes me, but I don't know why he likes me. And if I find out what it is that he likes about me, I can make sure I don't change that about myself. Because what if I stop doing whatever he likes? And then he stops liking me because I'm not doing it anymore?"
3,1,Linda,"Well, maybe he just likes hearing you talk."
3,1,Candace,Huh?
3,1,Linda,"Hey, where's Perry?"
3,1,Major Monogram,It's not like Agent P to miss...
3,1,Carl,"Right away, sir! (Presses play on the remote control and Perry slides on the video)"
3,1,Major Monogram,(Laughs)
3,1,Carl,"(Presses the slow motion button and Perry is in slow motion) Look sir, it's even funnier this way!"
3,1,Major Monogram,"(Laughs) Stop it, stop it. My cheeks hurt."
3,1,Major Monogram,"Oh uh... (Clears throat) Grow up, Carl!"
3,1,Major Monogram,"Anyhow, as you probably noticed there's been an unusual amount of rain in the Tri-State Area. Call us crazy, but we're thinking Doofenshmirtz! Investigate, and stop him at all costs. Well, maybe at a reasonable cost. We, I mean, we don't want to blow the whole budget on this one scheme, do we?"
3,1,Carl,"Run it again, sir?"
3,1,Major Monogram,I'll get the popcorn!
3,1,Isabella,"Wow, that was fast!"
3,1,Phineas,"Well, nobody likes working in the rain. Let's get dry, ladies! (As Phineas, Ferb, and the Fireside Girls enter the bio-dome) This biosphere can simulate almost any environment. (Ferb pulls a lever, sand begins pouring out of the ceiling, a fake sun shines and the tiles on the inside of the biosphere turn sky blue.) Can we cook or can't we?"
3,1,Isabella,"You guys are the greatest! Okay, according to the Fireside Girl handbook, we can find water in cacti."
3,1,Jeremy,"Hi, Candace. What do you say to a little picnic? You know, indoors."
3,1,Candace,Neat!
3,1,Jeremy,"We can't let a little rain put a damper on our-- wow! (Sees the biosphere, and Candace panics) I guess your brothers have been busy, huh? Oh, we should have our picnic in there!"
3,1,Candace,"Um, um... Excuse me! (Walks away from Jeremy to resolve her inner turmoil) Urge to bust so strong, but I need time with Jeremy to find out why he likes me! Gotta resist urge to bust! Must not spoil quality time with boyfriend! (Composes herself and returns to his side) Uh, picnic in the dangerous, unauthorized, and highly bust-worthy biosphere? Sounds great! (Giggles insincerely)"
3,1,Isabella,"So, we've gotten water from a cactus, witnessed a mirage, and learned the difference between sunstroke and heatstroke. Thanks for that, Adyson."
3,1,Adyson,Hey... the salamanders quit singing... (Giggles)
3,1,Isabella,"Now we just need to either collect a sand sample, measure the temperature, or milk a camel."
3,1,Isabella,You guys!
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, I set up this whole thing with lasers and flypaper, falling cages, spinning platforms, on the way to a trapdoor... (The camera pans across this devious contraption) And you just come and slip on a chair, and waste a day's worth of work. Eh. (As Perry emerges from the hole in the ground in a green glass tube) But it's gonna look great on the Christmas party gag reel, hehehe! Of course, it'll just be me at the party, uh...yeah. (Sighs) I need a laugh at the holidays. Anyway, gotcha! Go ahead, try to climb out of it."
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs) It's greased! So, now that you're all comfy cozy I can introduce you to my Rain-inator! I've been using it to pour millions of gallons of water into these clouds, causing it to rain all over the Tri-State Area! I can't believe nobody's noticed it. It's kind of obvious."
3,1,Isabella,"Yay! We made it across the desert! Say, Phineas, I don't suppose you could help us out with our Rainforest Navigation Patch?"
3,1,Phineas,"No problem, ladies. Ferb?"
3,1,Jeremy,"Well, this sure beats all that rain. Not too hot, are you?"
3,1,Candace,"No, no, not at all! I mean, isn't that what you said you liked about me? That I don't ""overheat""?"
3,1,Jeremy,"Heh, no. The thing I really like about you is..."
3,1,Jeremy,"Wow, this is incredible!"
3,1,Candace,"Um, uh, what was that you were saying?"
3,1,Jeremy,"I said, This is incredible!"
3,1,Candace,"No, before that."
3,1,Jeremy,I said...wow!
3,1,Candace,(In a shallow state of calm) Pardon.
3,1,Jeremy,Sure. Hmm...
3,1,Adyson,Hey! I think I found a new species of -
3,1,Isabella,"Here, Adyson! Catch this! (Throws the lasso) Swift Water Rescue Patch! Bonus!"
3,1,Jeremy,Candace!
3,1,Candace,Yes?
3,1,Jeremy,Check it out. This umbrella makes a sweet raft. Wanna float down the river with me?
3,1,Candace,(still fighting between her two halves) Busting. Boyfriend. Busting. Boyfriend. Busting? Boyfriend! (Giggles) Coming!!!
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"So, I bet you're wondering why did I cause all this rain. You see, while perusing local garage sales, I came upon a big screen TV from 1985. (Removes the tarp covering it) But when I went to turn it on, it was stuck on the Spanish channel!"
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"All it played was crazy variety shows and Mexican soap operas. (Turns on the TV) I really got hooked on one of them, though: El Matador de Amor. (Sets up his armchair to watch the soap opera.) It has three simultaneous story lines that interconnect... Genius! Anyway, the last episode was a cliffhanger..."
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"...in which Esmerelda is going to find out why Juan loves her. At least, I think that's what's going to happen... But the show got preempted by a soccer game! Oh, I hate soccer! It makes no sense whatsoever! The clock runs up instead of counting down, what is that?! (Removes popcorn from the microwave and sits down in his armchair.) So with the help of my Rain-inator I rained the game out."
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming."
3,1,Spanish Man on TV,¡La Esponja Milagroso! Absorbes... (continues under)
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"In 10 minutes, the show is gonna start, and with you trapped and the Rain-inator at work, nothing will interrupt me!"
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, less pounding back there, okay? You're lucky I sprang for the clear tube, this way, you can watch too!"
3,1,Jeremy,"I mean, it's like your hair was genetically engineered to ensnare those giant fruit bats."
3,1,Candace,And you like that about me?
3,1,Jeremy,"It's certainly interesting, but...it's not what I like about you."
3,1,Candace,What then?
3,1,Jeremy,"Well, let me put it in a song."
3,1,(Song,"""Set the Record Straight"")"
3,1,Jeremy,♪ All throughout history men fall in love with women ♪
3,1,Candace,"So, you were saying?"
3,1,Jeremy,"Oh, yeah."
3,1,Jeremy,"Hey, guys! Uh-oh, here comes the fun part!"
3,1,Candace,Fun part?! Seriously?!
3,1,Isabella,Jungle Navigation Patch: complete! Anybody up for a little rock-climbing?
3,1,Phineas,Behold Mount Ferbius!
3,1,Ferb,"Sorry, Adyson."
3,1,Adyson,The salamanders are back...
3,1,Isabella,Who wants a Concussion First Aid Patch?
3,1,Candace,Incoming!!!
3,1,Jeremy,"(As he moves his arms and legs back and forth) Ha, hey, look, Candace, I'm making snow angels."
3,1,Candace,(Grumpily) I'm wet and I'm freezing cold.
3,1,Jeremy,"Ah, it's not so bad. I mean, we're together, aren't we?"
3,1,Candace,"Well, yeah..."
3,1,Jeremy,And being together like this makes me realize what I like about you.
3,1,Candace,(Excitedly) What? What???
3,1,Jeremy,What's that sound?
3,1,Candace,That could've squished us! That's it! I am gonna bust them!
3,1,Jeremy,"(As Candace stomps away angrily) Wait, Candace, look! It's just papier-mâché! (Lifts the boulder easily)"
3,1,Isabella,"Good job, everyone. I think we've earned our Rock Climbing Patches."
3,1,Phineas,"(In a hang-glider) Congratulations, ladies. How do you feel about Non-Powered Flight Patches?"
3,1,Candace,"Hey, come back here! I'm gonna bust you two if it's the last thing I--"
3,1,Spanish Man on TV,El Matador de Amor.
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"(As sappy guitar music plays in the background) It's starting! It's starting!!! Okay, now, Perry the Platypus, shhh."
3,1,Esmerelda,"Oh, Juan..."
3,1,Juan,"Por lo Tanto su manada gemela, ha sido en Venenado..."
3,1,Candace,(Screams) Help me!
3,1,Jeremy,"Hold on, Candace, I'll save you!"
3,1,Jeremy,"Oh, man, I love this umbrella!"
3,1,Linda,"Hey, kids!"
3,1,Jeremy,"You know, Candace, what I was trying to say back there is that...well, the thing I like about you is..."
3,1,Candace,Wait! Hold that thought! I'll be right back. (She runs over to Linda in her usual fashion.) Mom! Mom! Backyard! Now! Biosphere!
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,(from inside) He's getting closer...he's looking into her eyes!
3,1,Juan,Es! La razón porque te amo (Repeat) La razón porque te amos es... es...
3,1,Sport Announcer,¡Ahi Van la Pelota!
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,What?! No!!!!!
3,1,Candace,"It's right here, Mom! Come on, come on, come on!"
3,1,Phineas/Fireside Girls,"Hi, Candace!"
3,1,Linda,"(enters) Hmm, I've really got to fix the latch on that gate. (Both turn around and see the empty backyard.) Um..."
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"How is this possible? I took every precaution! I had the Rain-inator, I had you trapped in a - what the?"
3,1,Doofenshmirtz,"¡Maldito seas, Perry el Ornitorrinco! Man, this is gonna cost me a fortune on my water bill."
3,1,Linda,"So, did you ever find out why Jeremy likes you?"
3,1,Candace,"Jeremy! (She bolts over to him.) Now, please continue your thought. Tell me why you like me."
3,1,Jeremy,You bet. The reason that I like you is...
3,1,Sport Announcer,"¡Viene, le pega! ¡GOOOOOOOL!"
3,32,Ohio,"This is it. Giant Cannibal Cave! According to the map, Beserk Magurk stashed it here. No one ever saw him again. This way! Up these Giant Cannibal Stairs!"
3,32,Ohio,"There it is - the Amulet of Juatchadoon! And that must be Magurk, down there on that Giant Cannibal Dining Set! (Grins) How much rope do you have? (Rhode Island gestures to several hundred feet of rope) As always, you are prepared."
3,32,Ohio,"So, the markings on this amulet should lead us to the lost Temple of Juatchadoon!"
3,32,Norm,Who wants cocoa?
3,32,Ohio,"Hey, let us go, you big galute!"
3,32,Ohio,(With disdainful recognition) Doofenshmirtz.
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, well, well. Ohio Flynn and Rhode Island Fletcher. What are you doing here?"
3,32,Ohio,That depends - why are you slow clapping?
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, I don't know, I thought it would make my entrance more dramatic. And it totally worked!"
3,32,Ohio,"(At Rhode Island) You know, he's right. It was more dramatic."
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, hand over that amulet!"
3,32,Ohio,"No way! (Rhode Island holds the amulet away from Doofenshmirtz) We retrieved it, fair and square!"
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,(Laughs) Tell it to the Abominable Snowman!
3,32,Ohio,"Well, that's a weird expression...?"
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"No, I mean tell him right now - LOOK!!"
3,32,Norm,(Wobbling around after the boys) I'll just run ahead!
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Maybe the ""Giant Cannibal"" thing was a mislead! I think the dining set was his! (He hops behind Norm onto their rocket-powered sled.) Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!! (The Snowman makes a huge snowball and tosses it down the mountain after them. It crashes into their sled and they roll down the hill with it.)"
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"(Wincing) Oh, mama!"
3,32,Norm,(Starts slow clapping)
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Way too soon for a callback, Norm."
3,32,Lawrence,"Hello, gents! What's your fancy?"
3,32,Ohio,"Well, fame, glory, money, and the preservation of semi-mystical historical treasures... but, we'll settle for hot fudge sundaes!"
3,32,Candace,"They're here! Ee-ee-ee-ee... (runs to a nearby telephone booth in the saloon, and then dials a number)"
3,32,Chief Linda,"(On phone, voice-only) Daily Tableaux?"
3,32,Candace,Chief! Who do you think just showed up in Panama?
3,32,Chief Linda,If you're gonna try and sell me another fairy tale about Ohio Flynn and Rhode Island Flet--
3,32,Candace,"There's a scoop here, and I can smell it! (A fly-ridden hick walks through the saloon doors, carrying a pig) Or they haven't invented deodorant soap yet, but there's still a scoop!"
3,32,Chief Linda,Fine. But I wanna see pictures!
3,32,Candace,I won't let ya down!
3,32,Ohio,"(Back at their table, to Rhode Island) Someone around here is bound to know something about the lost Temple of Juatchadoon! (Isabella enters in a purple dress, holding a fan to obscure most of her face)"
3,32,Isabella,(Said in the same manner as her catchphrase) Juatchadoon?
3,32,Ohio,(Without looking at her) Exactly. We don't even know if it really exists!
3,32,Isabella,"(Sitting down at the table as the boys remove their hats) Oh, it exists all right! And I know where to find it!"
3,32,Ohio,(Intrigued) Go on...
3,32,Isabella,"Isabella Garcia-Shapiro. Femme fatale, ingenue, amateur archeologist, and licensed tile and grout installer. (A Tarzan-like figure in a loincloth swings from a vine behind them) A girl has to earn a living!"
3,32,Ohio,Pleased to meet you! Do you know anything about...this? (Removes the amulet from around his neck)
3,32,Isabella,(Gasps) The Amulet of Juatchadoon! The legend says it can awaken an evil corn colossus with the power to destroy the world!
3,32,Ohio,"Makes you wonder why ancient people were always making stuff like that...I mean, what's the upside? (A number of arrows fly behind them)"
3,32,Isabella,"My mother, New Hampshire Garcia-Shapiro, was searching for the Temple when she disappeared! I'm afraid something terrible has happened to her! You've just gotta help me! (Hands Ohio another card) I'm also a certified Damsel in Distress."
3,32,Ohio,"Well, we don't normally go searching other archaeologists slash adventurers, but I guess we can make an exception. Now if we only knew which way she went..."
3,32,Isabella,(Pulls out a map) Would this map she sent me help?
3,32,Ohio,"Yes, yes it would. We're gonna need transportation. (Puts away the map in his inner jacket pocket) (At Rhode Island) Rhode Island Fletcher, I know what we're gonna dig up today!"
3,32,Candace,(snaps a picture of the scene) Ee-ee-ee-ee...
3,32,Lawrence,"Gentlemen, please! There simply are no more maraschino cherries!!"
3,32,Major Monogram,"There you are Agent P! Welcome to the meeting of the Secret Order of the Knights Without a Cool Acronym or SOKWCA. As you know, it is our duty to...Hey! You're not wearing your fez. (Pointing to a part of the room) Better go to the fez dispenser. (Perry takes off his fedora and gets a fez from a vending-machine like dispenser) As I was saying, Doofenshmirtz is dangerously close to laying his mits on the lost Idol of Juatchadoon. If he were to get hold of it, it would be blood-sucking-Chupacabra-brain-eating-zombie-ancient-Mayan-Gods-come-to-life-weird-voodoo-curses-with-goat-heads and what not bad. Now, get out there and stop him Agent P."
3,32,Carl,Why are we wearing a fez in the middle of Central America anyway?
3,32,Major Monogram,(In a shocked tone) You mean we're not in Egypt! I thought those pyramids were kind of stair steppy.
3,32,Baljeet,Last stop! I'm afraid there is no way to get to the East Coast by boat unless you go all the way around South America.
3,32,Buford,Nothing but jungle from here on out.
3,32,Ohio,Care to come with us?
3,32,Baljeet,(Sarcastically) And spoil my carefully calculated air of selfishness and unconcern? Not until the last second thank you very much! (Baljeet and Buford sail away leaving the rest of the group behind)
3,32,Isabella,(To Candace) Its sweet of you to help us find my mom Ms...?
3,32,Candace,Candace. And are you kidding? I've been trying to get a good scoop all summer long!
3,32,Isabella,Well it's a lucky thing you accidentally hammered yourself into that crate marked temple expedition supplies then isn't it.
3,32,Candace,"Boy, I'll say"
3,32,Ohio,We've found it! (He and Rhode Island look through the foliage at a looming step pyramid) It's the fabled Temple of Juatchadoon!
3,32,Ohio,"(He reads writing on the doorway) If you choose to go further you'll wish you weren't born. (Candace takes a picture) The road to destruction is paved with corn. Cheery! (He walks towards the glass case) There must be some trick to opening this case. A latch, or somewhere to twist it or..."
3,32,Isabella,"Or, we could hit it with a rock. (She hits the glass case with a stone and it shatters)"
3,32,Ohio,"Yeah, that works."
3,32,(Song,Don't Look Down)
3,32,Ohio,This is it guys; the corn colossus of Juatchadoon! (Candace takes a picture just before she and the rest of the group get trapped in a cage )
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,Oh yeah! Oh yeah baby! (He is standing on a descending totem pole)
3,32,Ohio,(With disdainful recognition) Doofenshmirtz! Nice entrance.
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that whole subtle thing wasn't working out for me as you know. Now, hand over that amulet."
3,32,Ohio,YOU FIEND! You think we're just gonna give it to you!
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, yes I do. (He opens the cage door and lets Isabella out)"
3,32,Isabella,(At Ohio and Rhode Island) Sorry boys. (At Doofenshmirtz) Here you go! (She gives him the amulet and her map)
3,32,Ohio,"Isabella, you dirty double crosser!"
3,32,Isabella,"I forgot to give you this one. (She hands Ohio a card that reads ""Isabella, Dirty Double Crosser"". He looks up unamused.) Okay, I've kept up my end of the bargain. Now where's..."
3,32,New Hampshire,(In a distressed tone) Isabella!
3,32,Isabella,"Mom! (She rushes over to a trench in the ground, where she finds her mom)"
3,32,New Hampshire,"Oh mi hija, you came!"
3,32,Isabella,Are you okay?
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, she's fine, but she could use a little company! (He pushes Isabella into the trench) Ha Ha. Now, if you don't mind I've got a little ceremony to conduct. Let's see, probably instructions on the back or you rub it or twist it... (The amulet activates and starts shooting out yellow lightning.) AAAHHH! AAAHHH! Okay, okay. Getting used to it, getting used to it. Yeah, I'm good! Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha. (The yellow lightning hits the colossus and it awakens)"
3,32,Candace,This is it! (She takes multiple pictures while Doofenshmirtz cackles in the background)
3,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, I have the power to bla, bla, bla, supernatural, bla, bla, et cetera, et cetera. But first I'm going to New York; we'd kill on Broadway! (There is a loud explosion on the background) What the...!"

3,32,Ohio,We've got to lead the Corn Colossus away from those backup singers!
3,32,Isabella,OMG! Coolest sentence ever! Somebody write that down! (Rhode Island writes it down while Ohio picks up an ear of corn)

3,32,Candace,"(In a sarcastic tone) Gee, you think?"
3,32,Isabella,(They approach the top of the temple. The corn colossus is still in hot pursuit of the group) Running out of steps here!

Hey what's with the fez anyway, we're not even in Egypt! (Perry pulls the tassel on his fez and it flies upwards, revealing a fedora underneath. The flying fez has an automated claw, which seizes the amulet from Doofenshmirtz. With the amulet still in its grasp, the fez flies upwards and out of the temple) You're a real spoil sport you know that."
3,32,Candace,"Okay, thoughts?"
3,32,Ohio,(The flying fez and the amulet appear in front of Ohio) The amulet!
3,32,New Hampshire,"Ooh, we can use the amulet to control the Corn Colossus!"
3,32,Isabella,We have to figure out how to activate it!
3,32,Ohio,Or we could hit it with a rock. (He hits the amulet and it shatters. A yellow beam of light shoots out of the center of the temple and the colossus turns into popcorn) Oh now he pops! How does that make any sense?

3,26,Isabella,We can start cooking as soon as Baljeet gets back with the potatoes.
3,26,Baljeet,"No! No, you cannot! We looked all over the place, but there are no potatoes in the entire Tri-State Area!"
3,26,Buford,And I'm down to my last potato chip! Better make this bad boy last...
3,26,Isabella,What am I going to do? Have you ever seen senior citizens riot? It's like a slow gray tornado of canes and false teeth!
3,26,Phineas,"Buford, let me see that potato chip. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna use the DNA in this potato chip to clone our own potatoes! Hey, where's Perry?"
3,26,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P! We recently learned that Doofenshmirtz has fallen behind on his electrical bills. This seems odd considering his generous alimony package. His ex-wife, Charlene, is loaded! And, I might add, quite a handsome woman. (Perry stares in boredom) No, not, not that I've given that a great deal of thought. (clears throat) Investigate at once. Monogram out!"
3,26,Candace,Summer is boring! I am so-oh-oh-oh bored...
3,26,Linda,Why don't you call Jeremy?
3,26,Candace,He's working.
3,26,Linda,What about Stacy?
3,26,Candace,Grounded.
3,26,Linda,Jenny?
3,26,Candace,Protesting.
3,26,Linda,(flatly) What about busting your brothers?
3,26,Candace,"Well, it's nice of you to take an interest, but they're not even in the backyard."
3,26,Linda,"Well, you can't sit inside on a gorgeous day like today. So, Missy, grab that pink bike! We're gonna get out and about!"
3,26,Candace,I don't think so.
3,26,Linda,"Oh, come on, It'll be fun. (drags Candace by the arm)"
3,26,Candace,"Whoo-hoo, hooray."
3,26,Doofenshmirtz,"(laughs) So, Perry the Platypus, do you like your trap? It's called the stocks! I read about it in this book, Ten Greatest Historical Traps of All Time. Look, it's a pop-up! (shows a pop-up bear trap) It also came with this bonus pamphlet, The Ten Greatest Historical Armies of All Time. And according to this, the Spartan Army was fierce, unstoppable, and followed every order without hesitation. Which is why I got this! (leave, emerges in Spartan General costume) Huh? It's a Spartan General costume. Yeah, it must have been...warmer in Ancient Greece. (pause) Anyway, once the Spartan Army sees me in this, they'll obey my every command! And help me take over the Tri-State Area! And how will I acquire the Spartan Army, gone lo these many millennia? With my Historical-Army-Retrieve-inator! I-it's potato-powered because I spent this month's alimony check on my last inator. You remember that, the Made-of-Gold-inator. And you know, I wore out three pairs of shoes buying up all these potatoes, but...on the good side, it smells like French fries in here."
3,26,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, behold the wonder that is the Spudsalot! Buford, the potato sample."
3,26,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, start her up."
3,26,Phineas,It's working!
3,26,Isabella,"Oh, thank goodness! Now I can... Uh, Phineas, those potatoes have eyes."
3,26,Baljeet,All potatoes have eyes.
3,26,Isabella,"Yeah, but these eyes blink!"
3,26,Phineas,"Buford, you didn't put that chip in your mouth, did you?"
3,26,Buford,"And if I did, would that be...actinable?"
3,26,Phineas,I think the DNA from Buford's saliva must have combined with the potato's DNA to make some sort of... (the potatoes stand on their own) Buford potato hybrid! Let's get outta here!
3,26,Buford,"Oh, look at the little guys, they're like little bullies! I am both proud and ready to soil my pants in terror."
3,26,Potato Gremlin,I like my tacos spicy.
3,26,Phineas,"We should probably do something about them before they do, um, whatever...mutant Buford potatoes would do."
3,26,Isabella,But what about the party?
3,26,Phineas,"Right! Baljeet, you and Buford go stall the seniors while the rest of us simultaneously round up the spud spawn. Hey, wait. Ferb, isn't ""simultaneously"" on our list of ""S"" words seldom used by kids?"
3,26,Phineas,Awesome!
3,26,Linda,See? Isn't this fun?
3,26,Candace,(not so thrilled) Thrilling. (hears growling) What?
3,26,Candace,"Mom, look! Potato, uh, gremlins! And Phineas and Ferb!"
3,26,Linda,"(turns her head to see a carrot juice truck go by) ""Potato gremlins""? Candace, are you okay?"
3,26,Candace,"(Smiling) Never better. Come on, Mom, let's step it up! (takes off)"
3,26,Linda,I'm glad you're finally getting in the spirit.
3,26,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, to summon the Spartan Army! (fires up the inator) Ooh! Here they come! Here they come! They're coming!"
3,26,Mongol Army,Huh?
3,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha-ha! What, wait, what? A Mongol army? Really? Huh, I must have had the dial set for...""Hun"". Oh, well, you don't look a gift horde in the mouth, so...hello! Hi there, me, yeah. Welcome to the future, my ruthless Mongol Army. I realize you can't understand what I'm saying, and you're probably confused a bit by the Spartan General's uniform, uh, but together, we will rule the Tri-State Area..."
3,26,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow! Hey, what are you... (notices the Mongols messing up the kitchen) Oh, you're hungry! I guess it has been 1,200 years since you've eaten. Well I suppose we could call out... (the Mongols trample him again and bust through the wall) Oh, you ruined my helmet. Now I've gotta get a new costum... Wait a second, that's it! I'm in the wrong outfit! All I have to do is hit the costume shop, then round up my Mongols, and the Tri-State Area will be mine! (runs off laughing)"
3,26,Senior citizens,We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes!
3,26,Old man 1,Hey! Where's my nosh?
3,26,Old man 2,I don't have to put up with this. I'm part of the greatest generation!
3,26,Baljeet,"Buford, what are we going to do? Phineas wants us to stall. We gotta think of something!"
3,26,Buford,"Uh...wait a minute. I got an idea. (holds up a sock puppet, in high voice) Hello, folks! I'm Mr. Sock! Hey! Who turned out the lights? (Buford draws eyes on the puppet) Thanks!"
3,26,Old lady,You stink!
3,26,Buford,(As Mr. Sock) That wasn't very nice!
3,26,Baljeet,"(high voice) Technically, we are socks."
3,26,Buford,"(As Mr. Sock) Hey, Mr. Other Sock! What are you doing here?"
3,26,Baljeet,(As Mr. Other Sock) Just looking!
3,26,Buford,(As Mr. Sock) For what?
3,26,Baljeet,(As Mr. Other Sock) My sole mate!

3,30,General Carl,"Should I order the final attack, sir?"
3,30,Regent Monogram,"No, no, General Carl. A full-scale attack now would put the Princess at risk. Oh, if only Master Perry had not given up the way of the warrior and gone to live a contemplative life on the Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness, he could retrieve the Princess. Oh, if only someone could reach him and tell him of our plight!"

3,30,Princess Isabella,"Doofus Khan, (budges free from the grip of two warriors) Regent Monogram will have your head!"
3,30,Doofus Khan,"Regent Monogram will never attack as long as I have his Princess. Which should buy me all the time I need to complete my secret weapon and take over the Tri-Province area! Meanwhile, I'm putting you in the penthouse dungeon. You'll love the view. Of course I've planted booby traps all along the way and I alone know how to avoid them. (He gets hit by a giant shoe) Heh. Must have forgot that one. (A step opens up and he notices a hammer) Oops! (The hammer shoots a laser at him) Oh, that's right. (The step opens again) You're supposed to skip this step. (He screams as he falls into a step. He gets burnt, and gets chomped on by piranhas) Everything's under control, but-- (The step opens once again and gets hit by a boxing glove) Testing the system-- (Various booby traps are activated as the camera pans to the top of the stairs) Hey, hey, it works. (Gets caught by a bear trap) Anyway, here you are. (Takes out a set of keys and tries the keys to open the door) You'll have a nice rack to sleep on and some rats to keep you company.

3,30,Buford,Ya know what I hate about The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness? Just to get there you have to cross the Uncrossable River of Uncrossableness.
3,30,Baljeet,Who named all these things?

3,30,The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness,Hi there! Greetings!

3,30,Phineas,Master Perry! Doofus Khan has kidnapped the Princess and only you can save her!
3,30,Phineas,"You mean you won't? But why, Master Perry? What made you give up the life of a warrior hero?"
3,30,Phineas,What's he doing?
3,30,Ferb,That's a ripple dissolve. He must be having a flashback.
3,30,Phineas,Does he know we can't see it? Should we give him some privacy? I don't know the protocol for flashbacks.
3,30,Phineas,"Is he back? He's back. Well judging by the time you spent staring off into space I'm guessing something pretty bad. But someone has to rescue the Princess, if you won't come with us at least you can train us to do it ourselves."

3,24,Candace,Get off me!
3,24,Theater Usher,"Careful with that promotional bat, it's rented."
3,24,Stacy,You really rented a bat.
3,24,Theater Usher,"Yeah I know, it seemed like a good idea at the time."
3,24,Stacy,"Oh no, I think it's really paying off here. (Candace continues saying ""Get off me"")"
3,24,Phineas,"I know what you mean, Ferb, it does seem like more than 104 days."
3,24,Linda,"Boys, I'm off to Bobbi's. If you need anything, your father's inside watching television."
3,24,Lawrence,"Well, this isn't much of a horror movie. Where are the rock-and-roll musical numbers?"
3,24,Linda,"Oh, and Ferb, you left your pen on the kitchen table. Have fun today, I'll be back later."
3,24,Phineas,"Bye mom! I was wondering where that went. (to Ferb) Okay Ferb, lets have a look through our blueprints."
3,24,Phineas,"Cooking powered jet cars, haunted office building ride with tensos, a reenactment with the battle of Danville?"
3,24,Isabella,(walks in with a bamboo in her hand) Hey Phineas! What'cha dooooin?
3,24,Phineas,Trying to think of something to do today. What's that?
3,24,Isabella,"This is Bambina, my bamboo. Only, she's not doing so well."
3,24,Isabella,She needs help.
3,24,Phineas,The poor girl probably just needs some sunlight. Ferb and I can rake up a super growth lamp in no time.
3,24,Isabella,You'd do that for me?
3,24,Phineas,"Sure! Ferb, I know what we're..."
3,24,Buford,Hey!
3,24,Buford,How come you guys are making something special for her? What about me?
3,24,Baljeet,And me?
3,24,Buford,It's a nerd carrier. I had a heck of a getting him in. Scratched me all up!
3,24,Irving,"I'd like something, too!"
3,24,Buford,How long have you been there?
3,24,Irving,I'm not sure. What's today?
3,24,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're doing today. Taking requests. (pause) Hey, where's Perry?"
3,24,Major Monogram,"Oh, oh Agent P! How long have you been sitting there? Huh, guess I'd better get started. You received a weird message from Dr. Doofenshmirtz this morning, claiming that he will no longer seek to take over the Tri-State area. Then he used a very unusual method for conveying his message. Carl?"
3,24,Carl,"He wrote a letter by hand and put it in an envelope and sent it through the regular mail with a stamp and everything. Who does that? And it's scented. (smells envelope) Mmm, Milbank Nights. One of the better perfumes to come out of South Dakota."
3,24,Major Monogram,"When an evil scientist sends preread letters wrongdoing can't be far behind. Dismissed Agent P! Carl, let me uh, smell that letter again, would ya?"
3,24,Stacy,"I don't know, Candace, you're just lucky that bat didn't bite you. I mean, what if it was a vampire bat?"
3,24,Candace,"Me, a vampire? Don't be silly, Stacy. It would be cool to have super strength though. And be able to fly."
3,24,Stacy,"Yeah, but you'd never be able to see yourself in the mirror again. How would you put on your make-up?"
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the platypus, didn't you get my letter? Oh, of course not, here I-I'll read it to you."
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Dear Perry the Platypus, I know Major Monogram will ignore my letter and send you to stop me. That's why you are now trapped. Best wishes, your nemesis, Heinz. (finishes letter, talks to Perry) Come to think of it, it wouldn't of made much sense until now, it's probably good that you didn't get it earlier. It would have just been confusing, and I would have to be stuck with having to explain it to you. Speaking of stuck, you've landed on a square of the stickiest surface known to man. It's a tile from the floor of the Danville Multiplex. I discovered it when I went to go see that teen vampire movie. Loved it! And now... (closes window of machine) Behold, the Gimmelshtump-inator!"
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"See, Perry the Platypus, I've been setting my sights too high, I think. Trying to subdue a modern city, I need to conquer a backward land where people are superstitious. That's why I'm going to turn the Tri-State area into a reasonable festival in Gimmelshtump. The buildings, the clothing, the or easily conquered backward mindset. Here's a sample, look."
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,My beautiful modern state of the art bathroom is changed into...
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"A Gimmelshtumpian potter room. (scene switches to Dr. Doofenshmirtz) Ahh, that takes me back."
3,24,Candace,"Well, I got to get home Stacy. Jeremy's supposed to drop off my MP3 player this afternoon on his way to work."
3,24,Stacy,"Well, don't attack him, Ms. un-dead!"
3,24,Candace,"Right, as if. (talking to herself) Jeremy won't be here for another couple minutes. That gives me just enough to time to bust Phineas and Ferb."
3,24,Candace,"Okay, you guys are so... hey, they're not here. What's this? This stuff's way below they're usually bustable level. I wonder what they're doing out here with dad's old barbells. (Candace lifts barbells) Hey, I've never been able to... (gasps) Super strength. What if there really was a vampire bat? Candace, get a hold of yourself. I mean, it's not like I can fly. (Candace floats in air) Oh my gosh! Okay there's only one way to know for sure. A mirror. (Candace's reflection in the mirror disappears) Oh no, no reflection!"
3,24,Narrator Voice,Two minutes earlier...
3,24,Phineas,"Okay Ferb, let's run through the list. To fulfill Isabella's request, we've rigged a super bright (lamp turns on) pro-light to inadvertent go on and off as Bambina needs it. (lamp turns off) Next, Baljeet's request to lift heavy objects accomplished by using gravity-counter acting barbells. Check."
3,24,Baljeet,I am so happy. I have just torn my roariltica.
3,24,Phineas,Buford's request to float in the air using levitation air jets in the lawn.
3,24,Buford,Now I can look down on everyone.
3,24,Phineas,Last up is Irving's request to be invisible. Accomplished with this mirror shape live video playback and effects screen.
3,24,Irving,Sweet!
3,24,Narrator Voice,Two and a half minutes later...
3,24,Candace,Is it possible? Am I a vampire?
3,24,Candace,(Candace screeches) The hideous light of the day star! (gasps) I am a vampire. I must hide myself! (runs inside house)
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, what's going to be the first part of the Tri-State Area (Perry tears the floor tile from the ground - his feet still attached - and jumps onto Doofenshmirtz in the Gimmelshtump-inator) to get the Gimmelshtump make over?"
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow ow ow ow. Oh ya, take that! (Perry's hat flies in air) Haha, oh let me go, not the fore, forhe-- (takes breath) I don't know if you noticed or not but I was boxing champion in my middle-school back in Gimmelshtump and I got a few moves in... (Perry punches him in the stomach. Doofenshmirtz falls in Inator then Perry jumps onto him)"
3,24,Jeremy,"(knocks on door, then opens it) Candace? I brought your MP3 player with... (Candace screeches)"
3,24,Candace,"Don't look at me! I have to get away from you, Jeremy! For your own protection."
3,24,Jeremy,"Oh, hey Mr. Fletcher."
3,24,Jeremy,Oh Candace! Hey!
3,24,Candace,I have to find Phineas and Ferb! They'll know how to change me back.
3,24,Stacy,Did Candace just jump over that fence?
3,24,Jeremy,"You had to take her to the vampire movie, didn't you?"
3,24,(Song,Vampire Song)
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,Quit it! Quit it! Quit it!
3,24,1st Guy,"Yeah, my dad said I could drive it just as long as I didn't get a scratch on it."
3,24,1st Guy,Oh my dad's going to kill me!
3,24,2nd Guy,Why dude? It's not scratched.
3,24,Candace,Jeremy!
3,24,Jeremy,Oh hey Candace! Did you come to pick up your MP3 player?
3,24,Candace,"Huh, no-no! Have you seen my brothers?"
3,24,Jeremy,"Sure, yeah they were just here. They went home to look for you."
3,24,Candace,"Oh no, villagers! (runs out of Slushy Dog restaurant and screams)"
3,24,Jeremy,(German accent) Vat about your music box mitt ze Tiny Cowboy?
3,24,Candace,Oh no! More villagers! Gotta get home x4.
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"You don't stand a chance with that tile still stuck to your feet. (Perry jumps, and hits Doofenshmirt's knee and runs) Oh oh, my knee again, really?! (Doofenshmirtz chases after Perry. Perry comes behind a wall, forces one of his feet off the floor tile and uses it to trip Dr. Doofenshmirtz into a window) Wait wait wait! I need a bathroom break. I'll be right back. Okay? Don't do anything until I get back, okay? Don't touch a thing. I'll be right uhh... Ooohh. (Doofenshmirtz realizes his bathroom was changed into a pot and a light bulb, Perry jumps out of the Gimmelshtump-inator)"
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,What was that?
3,24,2nd Guy,Well now it's scratched.
3,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you Perry the plat... (Gimmelshtump-inator reverses his bathroom back to reality) Ohh, never mind!"
3,24,Candace,"Phineas, open the door! (knocks on door) Open the door, open the door. There's angry villagers out here. Open the door!"
3,24,Phineas,"Hey Candace, what's wrong?"
3,24,Candace,There's a bunch of villagers and they're after me.
3,24,Phineas,"You mean those guys? (shows marathoners running) Candace, I think they'd preferred to be called marathoners. (scene switches back to Phineas) Why would marathoners be following anyone? Besides you know, three guys from Kenya."
3,24,Candace,Because I'm a vampire Phineas.
3,24,Phineas,What makes you think you're a vampire?
3,24,Candace,Well I can lift heavy objects and I can levitate and... and I can't see my reflection in the mirror.
3,24,Ferb,It sounds like a vampire to me.
3,24,Phineas,"Woah, woah, woah, woah, come here Ferb, come here. I think I know what's going on here. Candace, when you discovered that you had these powers, were you in the backyard?"
3,24,Candace,"Yeah, why?"
3,24,Phineas,"Oh Candace that was just some stuff we made for our friends.(takes glasses off Candace) Your not a vampire, look I'll prove it. (takes hoodie off Candace) See? The sun has absolutely no affect on you."
3,24,Phineas,"Ferb, we're gonna need a dustpan and some glue."
3,24,(Song,Vampire Song)
3,18,Phineas,"I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. But, I guess that's life, huh? One minute you're having the best day ever, the next you're being fed to a monster the size of a two car garage."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah? Well, welcome to MY life! (the Goozim roars, he hides behind a robot)"
3,18,Phineas,Huh. And everything started out so well this morning.
3,18,(Pan in to the boys' bedroom. The Phineas and Ferb,"Across the Second Dimension logo pops up. Phineas's alarm clock rings 7:00 and a mechanical arm emerges out of it and pokes a sleeping Perry awake, he chatters, waking Phineas and Ferb)"
3,18,Phineas,"Good morning, Perry! Now that's the way to wake up. (He hugs Perry) This is gonna be the best day ever."
3,18,(Song,Everything's Better with Perry)
3,18,Lawrence,"Good morning, boys."
3,18,Linda,"Happy anniversary, Perry."
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, that's right! Gosh, I can't believe it's been five years. I remember the day we first got you."
3,18,Lawrence,"Come on, kids. Pick out any pet you want."
3,18,Linda,"Oh look, Phineas! This one's looking at you! (picks up Phineas and shows him a cat)"
3,18,Lawrence,"And this one's looking at you, Ferb! (picks up Ferb and shows him a dog)"
3,18,Young Candace,(walks through the aquarium section and all the fish swim away as she approaches) Why won't anything look at ME?!
3,18,Young Phineas,Ferb! This one's looking at both of us at the same time!
3,18,Linda,Awww...
3,18,Young Candace,"That thing? You're kidding, right?"
3,18,Store employee,Is there something I can do for you?
3,18,Lawrence,"Ah, yes, we'd like that one, please."
3,18,Store employee,(surprised) You want to adopt the platypus?
3,18,Lawrence,"Oh, is that what it is? Well, yes! May we have him please?"
3,18,Young Candace,What would you even name a platypus?
3,18,Phineas,"(Narrating) 'Course, Ferb and I knew exactly what to call you."
3,18,Young Phineas and Ferb,(simultaneously) Bartholomew!
3,18,Phineas,"And then when we got you home, we renamed you Perry. And gave you this locket!"
3,18,Candace,"(in her room, talking with her cell phone) Hey Jeremy, you wanna go to the mall?"
3,18,Jeremy,"(At his house) You know, I'd love to, but my Dad is taking me to check out his old college today."
3,18,Jack Johnson,(runs in) Boo-ya! Go Polecats! Boo-ya! (he runs away)
3,18,Jeremy,He's already set up an interview with the academic adviser. Can you believe that?
3,18,Candace,"Gee, Jeremy. I forgot you're a whole year older than me. A trip to college? Heh-heh.. That's, that's really great. Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye."
3,18,Phineas,"(holding a baseball bat and tapping the home plate) Alright, looks like the pitcher's ready, and...batter up!"
3,18,Isabella,"(enters) Hi, Phineas! What'cha doin'?"
3,18,Phineas,Turning Perry's involuntary reflex into sporting event.
3,18,Isabella,"Hi, Perry! Can I try? (scratches Perry's neck and the baseball is catapulted out of the yard)"
3,18,Phineas,"Whoa, mama! Nice shot, Isabella!"
3,18,Baljeet,(enters along with Buford) Did someone lose a ball?
3,18,Phineas,"Yeah, we were just playing platypult."
3,18,Baljeet,"Oh, I LOVE Platypus-themed sports!"
3,18,Phineas,"You know, if we had TWO Perrys, we could put a net between them and play platypult badminton!"
3,18,Buford,Who's Annette?
3,18,Phineas,"Ferb, that's it! I know what we're gonna do today!"
3,18,Buford,"No, seriously. Who's Annette?"
3,18,Phineas,"Okay, everyone. I think the tail is all set. I'll just go check with the foreman."
3,18,Isabella,(noticing Perry's absence) He's gone!
3,18,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry? (he checks under the machine) Did he really slip away? On his anniversary? Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed every single cool thing we've done all summer long. Well, I guess he can do whatever he wants. After all, it's HIS day, right?"
3,18,Baljeet,"Hey, what was the small noise?"
3,18,Phineas,Let's all go walk over to it!
3,18,Major Monogram,"Ah, good morning, Agent P. A quick word, recently you've been having some close calls, and your host family has nearly caught you sneaking into your lair several times. No need to remind you, but I'll do it anyway, that if your cover's blown, you'll have to be transferred to another city, with another host family. And we both know you wouldn't like that. (chuckles) I remember the day you were first assigned."
3,18,Female store employee,Enjoy your platypus!
3,18,Lawrence,Thank you! Cheerio!
3,18,Younger Carl,"(into a headset) Agent assignment complete, sir."
3,18,Younger Monogram,"(inside a computer-filled room) Good job, Carl! If you keep up the great work, you'll make unpaid intern in no time!"
3,18,Carl,(off screen) And I did!
3,18,Major Monogram,"Don't get cocky, Carl! Agent P, as you know, every operative is equipped with an auto-scan replication device, just like the one in your hat. We've been using the information you've gathered to replicate each and every one of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's inators. Our top men have been analyzing them to determine if they've been getting smarter or dumber. And, to be honest, the jury's still out. Now we find out that he's in the process of building an alternate dimension-related inator. Your assignment is to stop him, before he finishes building it. Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is Carl with some high-tech devices that you might find useful."
3,18,Carl,"(off-screen) Um, Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time. Would you mind lowering the platform again?"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Oh, great, let me... cue the music again."
3,18,Carl,Voilà monsieur! (He shows a wristwatch) This first item is our new wrist-communicationizer. It has many applications that will help you in the field. For example a powerful directional electro-magnet. It will draw any metal object to you. (He pushes a button and his glasses are drawn to it) See? And these are aluminum!
3,18,Major Monogram,"Quit goofing around, Carl, and show him the hologram."
3,18,Carl,"Yes, sir. (he pushes a button on the watch and turns on hologram of Major Monogram)"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Hehe, pretty nifty, huh? (from the hologram) With this device, you'll be able to contact me anywhere at anytime, but don't call between 3:30 and 4:00, because...that's when I take a shower. Whoa wee, wait a minute. (Points to Monogram on the big screen) Is that... me?"
3,18,Carl,"Oh, no! His holographic projection has become mesmerized by his video image! I better shut it off."
3,18,Stacy,"(enters) Hey, girl. Uh, what are you doing?"
3,18,Candace,"Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon, and here I am concerned with busting my brothers to my MOMMY and living in the NURSERY. (She picks up a ceramic unicorn) A unicorn! A UNICORN, Stacy! (mockingly) ""Hi, I'm six!"" You've GOTTA help me get rid of all this junk."
3,18,Stacy,"Wow, bold move!"
3,18,Candace,"Yep! Goodbye, childhood folly. Hello, carefree undemanding adult life!"
3,18,Linda,"(enters) Yeah, good luck with that. Candace, your father and I are off to the movies. While we're gone, you're in charge, okay?"
3,18,Candace,"Okay, Mom! (to Stacy) And you know, I'm even thinking of giving up on busting my brothers."
3,18,Stacy,"The irony is, that as a grown up, you don't NEED to tell your mom. You can just bust them yourself."
3,18,Candace,"(gasps) That's it! Stacy, I'm old enough to bust them myself!"
3,18,Stacy,That's what I just said.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror, as I punch a hole through to another dimension! (shows his Other Dimensionator) Behold! The Other-Dimension..."
3,18,Norm,Sir!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,What? What?
3,18,Norm,(in front of a large buffet table) I've finished setting up the buffet.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, for crying out loud, Norm. I was in the zone!"
3,18,Norm,I just thought you were playing with your doll.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"It's not a doll, it's a stand-in. Pretendy the Practice-pus, see? I wonder if Perry the Platypus practices with a fake me? It would be nice to know he cares about...(tennis ball eye falls off the stand-in)"
3,18,Phineas,"All systems are green, prepare to launch on my mark, T-minus thirty and counting. 29, 28, 27, 26..."
3,18,Carl,"...Of course, you'll only need this if you're attacked by one of the royals or a member of Parliament, so it's probably okay to leave the safety on. And here's your brand new rocket-car. (He shows it as Perry gets in and starts it) Sweet huh? Good luck, Agent P!"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Uh, Carl, did you tell him the accelerator's a little touchy?"
3,18,Carl,"I think he knows, sir."
3,18,Phineas,"...3, 2, 1, service!"
3,18,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, you are so bus... Oh my gosh! Where'd it go? You there! Small children! Where's the big contraption?"
3,18,Isabella,"I don't know, it was here just a moment ago."
3,18,Candace,"It disappeared! Stacy, do you realize what this means?"
3,18,Stacy,We're done?
3,18,Candace,"No, some mysterious force always takes away Phineas and Ferb's inventions before Mom shows up, this time, it took it away before I showed up! The mysterious force recognizes that I'm now a grown-up!"
3,18,Stacy,"""Mysterious Force""?, I'm not buying it, I am a woman of science, at least that's what my horoscope said."
3,18,Candace,"Well I'm going to prove it to you and bust my brothers at the same time, Where are my brothers?"
3,18,Baljeet,"We just launched them toward the park, Buford is there with the other platypult."
3,18,Candace,"Okay children, as the adult here, I decree we're going to the park, does anyone have to go potty first? (Stacy raises her hand) Fine, make it quick."
3,18,Phineas,Ferb! It looks like we're going to hit that building that looks vaguely like your head!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Time to give it a little test. (he turns it on, it starts for a brief second, then shuts down) Hmm. Well I just finished it, it can't be broken already."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,(sighs) I stand corrected.
3,18,Phineas,"We're really sorry, sir, I don't know what happened, one minute we were innocently launching ourselves across the city in a badminton platypult, the next thing we know, we're bouncing on up to the east side to your deluxe apartment in the sky."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it looks like you've totaled my Other-Dimensionator."
3,18,Phineas,An Other-Dimensionator? What does it do?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, at the moment, it just stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently, but it's supposed to let me go into other dimensions."
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, that's cool! We can help you fix it. I'm Phineas and this is my brother Ferb."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, but my friends call me.... (stops and thinks) I just got into such a funk."
3,18,Phineas,"Ferb is naturally handy with tools, I'll bet we could put this thing back together again in no time."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, what the heck, before we set up, there's a whole buffet here, please partake, I was expecting someone who seems to be running late."
3,18,Driver,"You're lucky I got a rocket car winch, lots of guys don't have that."
3,18,Phineas,"Almost there, okay, field compressor attaches to the auxiliary generator, was this working before?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well if by ""working"", you mean ""functioning properly"", then, uh, no."
3,18,Phineas,"Well I think I see your problem, everything is wired through this self-destruct button, do you even need that?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well of course I need tha... Wait! No I don't, I do not need that, you are absolutely right, huh."
3,18,Phineas,"So Ferb has rigged up this remote control, so that if we get separated from the portal, we can open another one."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Huh, nice touch, kid."
3,18,Phineas,"I guess this is the last piece, okay Ferb, boost me up. (Ferb lifts him)"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, I cannot wait!"
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Perry?
3,18,Phineas,"Yeah, he's our pet platypus."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Is every platypus named Perry?
3,18,Phineas,"In a perfect world, yes."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Aww, well he's a cute little fella, hi there. (he tickles Perry's chin) Gootchie... (Perry chomps down on his finger) OW OW OW!"
3,18,Phineas,"Perry, no! (He and Ferb pull him off) We do not bite the elderly!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Again, Ow. No, it's okay, platypuses don't typically like me."
3,18,Phineas,"Well Perry, you're just in time to see us open up a portal to another dimension."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, let's get this show on the road, huh?"
3,18,Major Monogram,"(his head appears beside Perry) Remember, if your cover's blown, you'll never see the boys again."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, does anyone hear someone talking?"
3,18,Major Monogram,(actually the hologram on Perry's watch) Never see them again...
3,18,Phineas,"Okay, here we go, (Ferb lifts him) right in he..."
3,18,Phineas,"Perry, no! (He and Ferb run over) Not on the sofa! (Ferb picks him up) Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. D, we should take him outside."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No no, it's alright. (he turns over the cushion) I was planning on replacing this old couch anyway. Now come on, let's light this pop stand, or however the saying goes."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Huh, it's a...it's a couch. That's a bit anti-climatic, I guess it's a nice couch, though."
3,18,Phineas,Uh...
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"(grabs the pink couch and tries to pull it to the portal) Okay, I got it, I got - uh, maybe, hey, you want to give me a hand here?"
3,18,Phineas,"Whoa, awesome! (He and Ferb, who's still holding Perry, enter the portal) Check it out!"
3,18,Major Monogram (2nd Dimension),Ahem.

3,18,Major Monogram (2nd Dimension),"Is this some kind of test? Is that really you, sir?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Ha ha! Holy Boy! Even the great Francis Monogram's my slave in this dimension!
3,18,Major Monogram (2nd Dimension),"I prefer the term ""Indentured Executive Assistant""."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I want to meet this other dimension me, where can I find him?"
3,18,Major Monogram (2nd Dimension),"Oh, you're from another dimension? Well then, he'll probably want to see you, he's into that freaky sorta stuff. Have a seat and I'll let him know you're on your way up."

3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Alright, who's interrupting my..."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, I'm you from another dimension."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Well that would explain the handsomeness.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Right back atcha, big guy."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Does that mean you and I are exactly alike?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,I suppose so.

3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Hmm, maybe we're not so much alike"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,That can be your catchphrase! You're the grumpy one. (Pokes him) Eh?
3,18,Phineas,"Wow, he's done really well for himself, what do you think, Perry?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),So what you're telling me is you're still not ruler of your Tri-State Area?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah? Well obviously YOU did not have to deal with MY nemesis, Perry the Platypus!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh didn't I? Observe! (He motions to a doorway, it opens, and something steps out)"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,What is it?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"This is Perry the Platyborg! He was once my nemesis, but now, he is general of my army!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, you are good!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Dismissed.
3,18,"(Phineas, Ferb, and Perry ride in on the same chairs Doofenshmirtz did)Phineas",That was awesome!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Ugh, now who's interrupting me? Remind me to berate my Indentured Executive Assistant!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, man, it's cool. They're with me."
3,18,Phineas,"Hey Dr. D, we thought we lost you."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, guys! (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz grabs him) Whoops!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),You dare to bring a secret agent in here?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,This boy's a secret agent?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"No, no, not him!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,The quiet one?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"No no, HIM!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,This plant?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),The platypus! That's secret agent Perry the Platypus!
3,18,Phineas,"Whoa whoa, hey, he's just a platypus, he doesn't do much."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh, oh this rich, I see what's going on here, you, you really think that he's your pet, don't you? WRONG! He's using you, you're just his cover, he's a secret agent! Here, here, let me prove it. (he looks up) General Platyborg, come down here at once! He'll be here in just a minute, and then..."
3,18,Phineas,Perry!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Told ya!
3,18,Phineas,How are his vitals?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Wait, let me try something. Platyborg, do the same thing to those two boys."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,What?
3,18,Phineas,What?
3,18,Phineas,Perry?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),HA! YES! I knew it!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, wait a minute, I'm confused, why does their platypus fight so good?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),(sarcastic) Really?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,What?
3,18,Phineas,Perry?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Get them!
3,18,Phineas,You're a secret agent?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Hey, be careful with that!"
3,18,Phineas,So this is where you disappear to everyday? You come here and fight this guy?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No no, he fights me, he doesn't really know this guy."
3,18,Phineas,You fight a pharmacist? Why would you even do that?!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Actually, I'm an evil scientist, but a lot of people are confused by the lab coat."
3,18,Phineas,"You're evil? He's evil?! (They back up to the window pane) So not only have you been leading a double life this whole time, but you sat there and let us help an evil scientist open an evil portal into an evil dimension, and you did nothing to stop us?!"
3,18,Ferb,"Well, he did pee on the couch."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait a second, I just realized, that was a conscious choice! You peed on my couch!"
3,18,Phineas,"No no, that wasn't enough! That's when you should've put on your little hat, not now, after we've gone forward into this mess!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh, for badness sake, you can hash all this out in prison. Guards!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Ahh! Brain freeze!
3,18,Phineas,"I-I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble processing this right now. (Perry hands him a pamphlet) ""So You've Discovered Your Pet is a Secret Agent..."" (throws it away) I don't want your pamphlet!"
3,18,Phineas,"Uh oh. (Perry moves them away, Platyborg turns back and flies at them) He's coming back around!"
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, you have got to be kidding me! (Perry still struggles) For crying out loud!"
3,18,Phineas,"All this time, we're like ""He's a platypus, he doesn't do much"". Well apparently, you do. You... you, you're tangled up in the..."
3,18,Normbot,(approaches them) May I please see your papers?
3,18,Both Doofenshmirtz's,"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Jinx, you owe me a soda!"
3,18,Normbot,"Get me, I'm a Georgia O'Keefe painting!"
3,18,Driver,"4th and Main. (Platyborg gets off and hands him some money) What? No tip? (Platyborg turns his hand into the mace) Never mind, I'm good. (He drives off, Platyborg looks around)"
3,18,Phineas,"Looks like they're gone. (Looks at Perry) You're a secret agent?! And you've been living with us this whole time? Was that evil guy right? Were we just your cover story? Were you ever really our pet or part of our family? (Perry looks down, depressed) Apparently not, cause you didn't trust us enough to tell us. Anyone else here leading a bizarre double life? (Ferb raises his hand) Put your hand down, Ferb. (Ferb lowers it) You're a secret agent. He's a secret agent! (Ferb puts a hand on Phineas' shoulder) You're right, Ferb, we have to concentrate on the task at hand, we need to get back to our dimension, and I don't even know where to start."
3,18,Phineas,"Wait a minute, I just realized, you could've been cleaning your own litter box this whole time! (Perry shrugs) Oh we are not done with this conversation! (They run off)"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"So tell me, other-dimension me. What do you see here?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,An ordinary platypus.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),And now what do you see?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,(gasps) Perry the Platypus!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz-2,"You know, I'm starting to see why you haven't become ruler in your dimension."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, Mr. ""Eviler than Thou"", how did you manage to take over the Tri-State Area, anyway?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Simple, I used an army of big, scary robots."
3,18,Normbots,We should do lunch sometime! (they revert back to the armored heads)
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, that is scary. I tried that robot thing once, too. I hid the self-destruct button on the bottoms of their feet, so nobody could reach them."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"I think I've said enough. I still don't get it, if we're the same person, how come you're so much better at being evil than me?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"True evil is born through pain and loss. You see, when I was a small boy back in Gimmelshtump, I had a toy train."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"(narrating) Then one day, I lost it."
3,18,Young Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Choo Choo?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,That's... That's it?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),What do you mean?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"That's your emotionally scarring backstory? That's your great tragedy? Dude, I was raised by ocelots, literally. Disowned by my parents and raised by Central American wildcats, and you're telling me you lost a toy train? That's it? That's all you got? Really? I had to work as a lawn gnome, I was forced to wear hand-me-up girl's clothing, neither of my parents showed up for my birth!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Well, how did you feel when you lost that toy train?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I never lost that toy train."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Well, maybe if you had, you would've done better. Since you have neglected to take over YOUR Tri-State Area, I think I'll go over there and give it a shot myself."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Great, we can be a team!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"(Sarcastic) Yeah, right, a team."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, was that sarcasm?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),(Sarcastic) No...
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, right there, I'm pretty sure that's my voice when I'm being sarcastic."
3,18,Candace,"Okay Buford, where are Phineas and Ferb?"
3,18,Buford,"How should I know? They never showed up for me to return serve. That's considered a forfeit in catapult badminton, so I went to get some Victory Gum."
3,18,Buford,A tradition as old as the game itself.
3,18,Candace,"Don't play with me, young man, where is the giant platypult they built?"
3,18,Buford,"Don't know, it seems to have vanished."
3,18,Candace,"Oh really? Did you hear that, Stace? The mysterious force took the platypult away before I, the grown up, could see it."
3,18,Stacy,"Yeah yeah, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for all of this."
3,18,Driver,"And they laughed at me for installing a platypult tow rig. Who's laughing now, Wayne?"
3,18,Candace,"The logical explanation IS the mysterious force, the question is, why does it care so much about my little brothers? Why doesn't it want them to get busted?"
3,18,Buford,"Well, why don't you ask it, Kierkegaard? (They stare) What? Existentialist Trading Cards. (Holds up a pack) Came with the gum."
3,18,Candace,"Wait, he's right! I should just ask it, I'll bet I can reason with it."
3,18,Stacy,"Reason with it? Candace, it's a force, that you made up."
3,18,Candace,"No, I know what I'm talking about, Stacy, Come on! (Pulls her)"
3,18,Stacy,Where are we going?
3,18,Candace,"To my backyard, the heart of the mysterious force!"
3,18,Baljeet,Would you like to trade two Sartre for a Nietzsche?
3,18,Buford,Alright. (He takes the cards and hands the other over)
3,18,Baljeet,Sucker.
3,18,Phineas,"Well, this should be our street, but it sure looks different."
3,18,Lawrence (2nd Dimension),"Boys, what are you doing here? You'd better get inside before the Doofbot catches you. I'm off to the factory. See you next week!"
3,18,Phineas,"Wow, well I guess we'd better get inside. (He is about to ring the doorbell when Perry walks up, Phineas looks) Uh, you might want to... Uh, I mean these guys might not know that you're not really a... you know..."
3,18,Linda (2nd Dimension),"(opens the door) Boys, I thought you were in your room! Get back inside and get your Dooferalls back on before someone sees you, if you need me, I'll be hiding in the basement."
3,18,Phineas,That was weird. Let's find the other us.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"And....hey, I got a one! Pick a Doofopoly instruction card. (reads) ""Conform"", hey, I can do that!"
3,18,Phineas,(walks in) Hey guys!
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Oh no, they're replacing us! (he hides behind the couch) I must not have conformed quick enough!"
3,18,Phineas,"No no, it's not like that, we're you guys from another dimension."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),A different dimension? Is that allowed?
3,18,Phineas,Apparently.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Oh look! Perry's back! (he runs up and hugs Perry) Where have you been? We missed you so much!
3,18,Phineas,"Uh, Phineas, he's not your Perry, he came with us."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Oh, sorry. (he reaches to hand him back, then stops) Wait, can I hold him a little longer?"
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"(hands Perry back) It's just, well, he left one day and never came back. He's been gone for a long time and I'm really worried."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Alright, you know the only time we're allowed to make noise is on Doofens Day, so keep it... (looks and turns around) Are there four of you in this room?"
3,18,Phineas,Five counting Perry.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"I see nothing, I have plausible deniability. (She walks off)"
3,18,Phineas,"Boy, your Candace is much less curious about you're up to."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),What do you mean?
3,18,Phineas,"Well, it seems like our Candace has spent her entire summer focused on what we're doing."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Summer? I think that was outlawed a long time ago.
3,18,Phineas,You guys don't have summer? Well that's-that's terrible.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Summer... It sounds dangerous, yet oddly compelling. What is it?"
3,18,Phineas,"What is summer? Man, where do I begin?"
3,18,(Song,Summer (Where Do We Begin?))
3,18,Phineas,"♪The days are longer, The nights are shorter, The sun is shining♪"
3,18,Ferb,♪It's noticeably warmer♪

3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Wow, summer sounds like a blast!"

3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"This is a message for other dimension Perry the Platypus, if you turn yourself in, I promise not to hurt your little friends. If you don't, all bets are off."
3,18,Phineas,(still talking) ...And then we launched ourselves from a giant Perry the Platypult... (he sees Perry sneaking off)
3,18,(Song,I Walk Away)
3,18,Phineas,"You know, I used to think you couldn't spell ""platypus"" without ""us"". (walks back inside)"
3,18,Ferb,"Well you can, but it would just be ""Platyp"". (he shuts the door)"
3,18,Phineas,"Well, I guess if you guys can't help us fix the remote, we could check with Isabella."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Who's Isabella?
3,18,Phineas,The girl who lives across the street.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Mom says that talking to neighbors can be dangerous.
3,18,Linda (2nd Dimension),(from basement) It's true!
3,18,Phineas,"Well it's time you meet her, come on, you'll like her."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),What about the Normbots?
3,18,Phineas,"Relax, we've been avoiding them all day, if you're really careful, you can... (they stop in front of a Normbot) Okay, we got to be more careful than that."
3,18,Normbot,(Norm Head) May I please see your identification?
3,18,Phineas,Uh....
3,18,Normbot,"(switches to Armored Head) Display your travel papers or be destroyed, display-display..."
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I can't stand these things!
3,18,Phineas,"Hey, it's Buford!"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),Do I know you guys?
3,18,Phineas,"We're Candace's brothers, we're going to Isabella's."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Are you part of the Resistance?
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),"I used to be in the resistance, but I got so good at it, that I started resisting them."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Behold, the Other-Dimensionator! Well actually, this is the Other Other-Dimensionator, the Other-Dimensionator is back in the other dimension. (2nd Dimension Doofenshmirtz glares) Okay, step 1 is push this button, (pushes it, it powers up) and step 2, stand back in awe! (it starts up, but then shuts down) Awww..."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),That's it?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, now that I think about it, those two boys made some modifications to my design which may have allowed to, you know, to work."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Great, now I need those two boys?"
3,18,Both Doofenshmirtz's,"Ah, Perry the Platypus!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Jinx, you owe me TWO sodas!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Listen, Perry the Platypus, I know I said if you turned yourself in, I wouldn't hurt your friends, but change of plans, now I need to hunt them down, which may involve a little hurting, I know that makes me a liar, but hello! Evil! (Perry glares)"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),Isabella's house is right over...
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),(tough voice) What'cha doin'?
3,18,Phineas,Isabella?
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),Do I know you?
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),"Hey, Isabella!"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"Ugh, him I know. Buford, what do you want? I thought you were resisting us?"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I was helping Candace's brothers cross the street.
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),Candace has two sets of twin brothers?
3,18,Phineas,"Uh no, he and I are from another dimension, we're trying to get back."
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"Alright girls, release them."
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),Why would you want to come to this dimension anyway?
3,18,Phineas,"Well, we didn't mean to come here, and now we can't go back unless we fix this device. (shows the remote)"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"Well, we may have someone who can help you. Dr. Baljeet!"
3,18,Phineas,Baljeet!
3,18,Baljeet (2nd Dimension),"That's Dr. Baljeet to you. Were you not listening? Here is the crux of your problem. Think of the universe and all of the many dimensions as circular. The energy flows between the dimensions like this, clockwise. Say that this is your dimension, and this is our dimension, you traveled with the flow of energy, so going clockwise would be easy. Going counterclockwise would take 8 million gigawatts of energy, overloading the local power grid. I have prepared a little song to help illustrate my point, (he plays an accordion)"
3,18,(Song,Baljeet Explanation)
3,18,Phineas,Well do you think you can get enough power to open the portal backwards so we can get home?
3,18,Baljeet (2nd Dimension),"Well, we should probably ask our leader..."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),(in deep voice) Ask your leader what?
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Candace, you're the leader of the Resistance?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"(deep voice) What are you two- (coughs, normal voice) -doing here? Never mind, I'll deal with you later. (walks up to Phineas and Ferb) You two! I've been spending all these years trying to keep my brothers safe, and suddenly their faces are all over the Doofen Channel!"
3,18,Phineas,We're just trying to get home.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Well, what's stopping you?"
3,18,Phineas,Right now? Quantum Physics.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Baljeet?
3,18,Baljeet (2nd Dimension),We need to generate 8 million gigawatts for inter-dimensional travel.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Then we've got work to do, Isabella, start redirecting the power."
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"Aye, aye!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Gretchen, monitor the Doofen Channel. Make sure we're not raising any alarms."
3,18,Gretchen (2nd Dimension),I'm on it.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Buford, keep resisting."
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),No!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Excellent. (deep voice) And will somebody get rid of that topiary?
3,18,Candace,"Oh, great and powerful Mysterious Force. I know you are just trying to protect my brothers, but I am just trying to protect them too from their dangerous inventions. Show yourself so that I may reason with you! (nothing happens) Maybe we should build a shrine to it."
3,18,Stacy,"Candace, that's ridic... (the dimensional portal opens up)"
3,18,Both,Ah! It's the mysterious force! (hides behind a tree)
3,18,Phineas,"Ferb, I think we got it, it looks like home!"
3,18,Stacy,What do we do now?
3,18,Candace,"I don't know, I can't believe it actually worked."
3,18,Phineas,"Well, thanks everyone. Hey, where's Per... Oh, that's right."
3,18,TV,"♪Doofenshmirtz Evil News Update!♪ (they look, we see a Normbot reporting the news)"
3,18,Normbot,"This just in, our supreme leader has just announced the capture of public enemy number one, Perry the alternate-dimension platypus! (shows Perry's mugshot, an X goes through it) I guess we won't be seeing him any more, except as a platyborg. (the channel switches to a test pattern) It's 3:30, we now conclude our broadcast day."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),(voice-over) Now go to bed!
3,18,Phineas,We've got to save him!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Oh no, too risky. You two have to get back to your dimension."
3,18,Phineas,We're not going anywhere without our platypus!
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I thought you said he was just using you as a cover?
3,18,Phineas,"I know what I said, I was hurt. But even if it was all an act, he's still a part of this family, and we're not leaving without him."
3,18,Baljeet (2nd Dimension),I may never be able to open this again.
3,18,Phineas,"It doesn't matter, we're going back for him."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Well then, you're on your own."
3,18,Phineas,"Fine, just tell us where Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),We have to help them!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),No we don't.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Yes we do, remember how we felt when OUR Perry disappeared?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Oh criminy, I must be crazy. Alright, we can get there through the tunnels."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Yes!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Let's suit up, people!"
3,18,Candace,"You know what, Stacy? I'm tired of the mysterious force pushing me around. I'm gonna show it who's boss! (she heads off)"
3,18,Stacy,Candace!
3,18,Baljeet (2nd Dimension),"I will try to keep it open for as long as possible, but the window is very unstable, even the slightest disturbance could cause it to collapse."
3,18,Phineas,"Hi, Candace."
3,18,Candace,"You guys are so... wait, why are there four of you?"
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, these guys are from this dimen..."
3,18,Candace,Are we inside the mysterious force?
3,18,Phineas,I'm not sure I understand the quest...
3,18,Candace,And why is Isabella suddenly fashionable?
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"What do you mean, ""suddenly""?"
3,18,Candace,"Seriously, where are we?"
3,18,Phineas,"(pulls Candace) Candace, I'm sure you have a million questions, but right now, we have to save Perry from being turned into a cyborg."
3,18,Candace,What?
3,18,Phineas,We'll explain on the way.
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"So, how do I dress in your dimension?"
3,18,Candace,"(notices 2nd Dimension Candace) Hey, is that me? I look good!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Oh no, you two stay here."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),But we want to help.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),That's an order! (runs off)
3,18,Candace,"Wait, so in this dimension, Perry is a secret agent?"
3,18,Phineas,"No, in this dimension, he's a cyborg."
3,18,Candace,"So, where is he an agent?"
3,18,Phineas,"That would be in our dimension, but we're not in our dimension right now."
3,18,Candace,"Okay, I'm having trouble processing this."
3,18,Phineas,Now I wish I hadn't thrown away that pamphlet.
3,18,Candace,And why are we in mine cars?
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),This will take us as far as the underground entrance to his headquarters.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"(showing a map) From there, we go up the ventilation shaft, the detainment center is on Level 4."
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),And the snack bar is on Level 5! (2nd Dimension Candace glares) If there's time!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Ugh, Buford. (Puts away the map)"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I'm just gonna get some nachos.
3,18,Candace,"So if there's another me, and another them, then there must also be another Jeremy Johnson here, right?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Huh? Oh yeah, Johnson Jeremy, leads a three-man strike team on the north side. Good soldier."
3,18,Candace,"Good soldier? That's all you think of him? Don't you think he's dreamy, or cool, or even cute? Tell me at least you think he's cute!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Cute doesn't win the war, kid."
3,18,Candace,"Oh... well I guess, but what do you guys do around here for, you know, fun?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Look, Candace is it? No offense, but fun isn't really on my agenda. You know, since Doofenshmirtz took over the Tri-State Area, even though I was a little girl, I've been focused on one thing, and one thing only, he's going down, down, down..."
3,18,Candace,"Down, I know, but what about BFF's, or slumber parties, or busting your little brothers?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Busting my brothers? I've spent every day of my life trying to protect my little brothers. I had to grow up pretty quick to make sure they didn't have to.
3,18,Candace,"Gee, you make growing up sound like it's a bad thing."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"It is what it is, I'll do whatever I have to do to protect the ones I love."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Aww, thanks, sis!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),What are you guys doing here?
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),We want to help.
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"Sir, we're nearing the target."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Ugh! (to 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb) Don't move!
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),We're not gonna help them?
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"No, we're going to get you two home where it's safe."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),But we want to...
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Look, this isn't our fight, it's theirs, and you two shouldn't have gotten involved!"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I don't remember it being so dark down here.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Dark?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,That's because it's a trap!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),I think they get that.
3,18,Phineas,"Perry! We uh, well... well, we uh, came to rescue you! (pause) So far it's not going as well as we'd hoped. We didn't have time to, you know, plan something elaborate, but we could've, I don't know, created some sort of diversion, just in case... (sighs) Yeah, we could've thought this out more."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"(laughs) I got you, and I got your little friends, too. Game over. You lose! I win! Mark this the hour of your doom, Perry the Platypus! (checks his watch) Three-forty...ugh, I got one of these watches with just the little hash marks on it. It doesn't even have numbers on it! Let's just say it's between 3:30 and 4:00, Eastern Standard Time."
3,18,Major Monogram,"(holograph) I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),They're getting away!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"I knew this was a bad idea. Okay, everyone in the cars!"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),Yes sir!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"(to 2nd Dimension Phineas and 2nd Dimension Ferb) You two, keep your heads down and remember your training!"
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),But we never had any training!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Well, keep your heads down! (they duck) Consider yourselves trained."
3,18,Phineas,"(to Candace) Uh, can you do that?"
3,18,Candace,Apparently...
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),I am so in love with her right now.
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),What?
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),Nothing!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"If we can get to the north tunnel before they get to us, I can trip the security door. (Perry pulls his collar off his neck) Isabella, give us more throttle!"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"It's all the way in, sir!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Alright, hang tough, this is going to get hairy. (She leaps away. Perry wields his collar and chain as a weapon, Phineas picks up a wrench and Ferb takes off his shoes and ties the laces together to make nun-chucks.)"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),Can we make those turns at this speed?
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Well we're about to find out! (she uses her staff to hit the turnstile, they swerve)"
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),There it is. We should be okay if we can just hold off these...
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Can we do that?
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"No, keep your head down."
3,18,Phineas,"(drops the ammo) No, no, no...!"
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),"We're slowing down, sir!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Keep it on the floor.
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),It's on the floor! (looks) There's too much track. I don't think we're gonna make it!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),Everyone to the front car. We're going to have to cut loose these cars...
3,18,Isabella (2nd Dimension),The motor's overheating!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Sorry guys, you're on your own."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),What are you doing?
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"My job, protecting you two."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),We have to go back and help them!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),That's not our fight.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),But we could've made it. We could've all made it!
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Or we could've all been captured, and I couldn't let that happen. These are the tough choices, people, someone has to be the adult here. You guys are safe, and that's what matters."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),But-but-but...
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),End of discussion.
3,18,Buford (2nd Dimension),"Man, I had my heart set on those nachos."
3,18,Stacy,"Uh, mysterious force. I feel a little awkward talking to you, because I didn't believe in you at first. Because lets face it, it's crazy, but then I saw you eat my friend, so, I've made a little shrine here. It's...It's nice, there's a banana, and, uh, oh, Mr. Miggins! So, I hope this makes up for the disbelief thing. Are we, uh, are we good?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Now you have no choice but to fix my machine!
3,18,Phineas,No.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),That's not one of your choices. Fix my machine!
3,18,Phineas,No.
3,18,Candace,"Can, uh, can I say something? So I think I'm up to date on the whole Perry-agent thing. Strangely, that's the most normal thing that's happened this afternoon... But who exactly is this guy?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Fix it!
3,18,Phineas,No.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Look, I would make myself do it, but apparently, he's an idiot."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Hey!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Fix the machine!
3,18,Phineas,No.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Very well then. You've forced my hand! (he pulls out a dog sock puppet)
3,18,Phineas,No.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Really? When I was your age, I did anything a puppet told me to do!"
3,18,Phineas,How old do you think we are?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"I don't know, one, two? It's hard to tell with the one eye. Anyway, I don't know why you're being so uncooperative. All I'm asking you to do is make my machine work so I can invade and conquer your world and enslave your loved ones."
3,18,Phineas,"See, that's just it. Why would we do something that would lead to our own self-destruction?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Self-destruction? Self-destruct... Wait, wait! I remember now! They took out my self-destruct button! (he pulls it out) I don't know why I put it back in, but here, I'll just rewire this, like so, and there! (he clips in a wire and turns it on, it forms a portal) It's working! It's working! It is functioning properly!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"(smirks at Phineas) Well well, look who just became redundant! Send them to their doom! (Platyborg points to Candace) Yes, her too. (He points to Perry) Yes yes, everyone. Doom, doom, doom, and..."
3,18,Both Doofenshmirtz's,Doom!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Jinx, you owe me THREE sodas!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Okay, doom for him, too."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"What? But, but I'm you!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),(sticks out the puppet) Doom!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, if I had a nickel for every time I was doomed by a puppet, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Welcome, doomed guests. Come on. Keep trudging. Doom is that away!"
3,18,Candace,"I would say so far, adulthood gets a three."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, this may be as good as it gets. (they walk onto a rocky area)"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),And now for my all-time favorite game...
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, wait, hold the phone. I can be useful. What if you need a kidney? Or a stand-in for boring functions you have to attend, or another kidney?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Doom!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, pooh."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Cranky, cranky, cranky. Oh, I love the crank!"
3,18,Phineas,"I'll be honest, Ferb. I'm having a hard time putting a positive spin on this. Blah blah blah, two-car garage, etcetera, etcetera."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, well, welcome to MY life! (The Goozim roars. He hides behind a Normbot.)"
3,18,Ferb,"Whoa, déjà vu-ish."
3,18,Phineas,"Hey, Perry. Check out that guard! (we see a ring of keys on a hook on his back) The keys!"
3,18,Phineas,Cool! (see the Normbot is also being pulled to them) Ah! Look out!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow! Is this the plan? (they fly into the air and over the lava, he screams) Please tell me this isn't the plan!"
3,18,Normbot,You are tampering with the property of... (he sparks and turns to the Norm head) Let's make omelets!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Ow! Can you get a little more lift on this thing? I think I just bruised a kidney.
3,18,Normbot,My bicycle is missing!
3,18,All,Yay! (the door then breaks off and falls down) Awww.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Ha, ha! Yes! Go, Goozim!"
3,18,Normbot,"It's muffin time, sir."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Already?
3,18,Phineas,"Okay, I see where you're going with this. (They all climb)"
3,18,Candace,I officially prefer our dimension.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, this may not be the best time to tell you, but I actually flunked jungle gym in grade school. I just couldn't get the hang of all that climbing and..."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh great, you caught it! Quick, unlock me!"
3,18,Candace,Are you even paying attention?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that's right. Uh, it can wait, later."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),More guards!
3,18,Normbot,"It's muffin time, sir!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz-2,You're broken! (hits him with a muffin)
3,18,Phineas,"Yay, other dimension Candace!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Phineas, catch!"
3,18,Phineas,The remote!
3,18,Candace,"What? No, don't let go!"
3,18,Phineas,"Perry, trust me!"
3,18,Candace,Two words: La-va! (Perry struggles)
3,18,Phineas,Trust me!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),They opened another portal! Get after them!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Thank you, Perry the Platypus."
3,18,Normbot,Stop where you are. You cannot leave.
3,18,2nd Normbot,"(Norm head) I use aggression to mask my insecurities! (he turns to the armored head and fires, Phineas dodges)"
3,18,Phineas,"The portal! (he shuts it, the other bots hit the lava and melt)"
3,18,Normbot,"(melting) (falling into lava) Wow, I could go for a (slightly muffled voice) lemonade!"
3,18,Normbot,"The portal closed, sir."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh pooh. Oh well, time to start the invasion! (he goes, the bots follow) And somebody get me a muffin!"
3,18,Normbot,"But it's not muffin time, sir!"
3,18,Phineas,"Alright, follow me. We're going around clockwise!"
3,18,(Song,Brand New Reality)
3,18,Buford,"Alright, how about two Kafka's for your Dostoevsky?"
3,18,Baljeet,"Stop wasting my time, Buford."
3,18,Phineas,"Wait, I think this is it."
3,18,Isabella,Where have you guys been?
3,18,Phineas,This is it.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"I spy with my one little eye, a new Tri-State Area that's one dictator short of a dictatorship. (he pushes a button and the Other-Dimensionator rises on a platform) Well, that's all about to change, pretty soon I'll be ruling over two Tri-State Area's, a virtual Six-State Area!"
3,18,Baljeet,"Uh, why is Perry wearing a hat?"
3,18,Phineas,"We don't have time to explain, we've got to try and stop an evil d..."

3,18,Woman #1,"They're never going to fire her, and... (there is a flash) Hey, did you see that?"

3,18,Old Woman,Oh my!
3,18,Woman #2,What is it?

3,18,Phineas,"I wish alternate dimension Candace was here, she took out like thirty of those guys with a lawn gnome."
3,18,Major Monogram,"Agent P, our agents are being overwhelmed by the sheer number of robots coming into our dimension. You must get to Doof's headquarters and stop him!"
3,18,Phineas,"Aye aye, sir! We're ready to serve!"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Oh no, you kids need to go home, where it's safe!"
3,18,Phineas,"With all due respect, sir, we've been through quite a lot together. We're a team now."
3,18,Major Monogram,"Nope, far too dangerous, and besides, our insurance won't cover it. Tell 'em Agent P."
3,18,Phineas,"Come on, Perry. Let's go kick some robot chassis!"

3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your neighbor, for like 12 years."
3,18,Mrs. Thompson,Who?
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,I live in the penthouse. I wear lab coats a lot. Speak with the accent I am currently speaking to you with.
3,18,Mrs. Thompson,Just like my neighbor upstairs.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, exactly!"
3,18,Mrs. Thompson,"Oh, he's not home. You'll have to come back later."

3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),I'm Jeremy Johnson. I'm here to rescue you.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Johnson, Jeremy?"
3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),"(saluting) Yes sir, and I also picked up a couple new recruits."
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"We figured out a way to bypass the entire security grid, it was cool!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"What? You brought my little brothers? Are you out of your mind, soldier?"
3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),"I didn't know they were your brothers, but I should've known. They're smart and courageous, just like you."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),You think I'm smart and courageous?
3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),"Well, yeah. Uh, sir."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Uh, good work, soldier."
3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),We should probably get out of here while we can.
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),The Normbots are in the other dimension? This isn't the time to escape. This is the time to make our move! (she puts on the glasses) Let's go!
3,18,Jeremy and Phineas (both 2nd Dimension),Yes sir! (they head out)
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Boys, wait! Thanks for rescuing me. I'm really proud of you both. (they hug)"
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),And we're proud of you too... Sir.

3,18,Phineas,We gotta do something about that portal!
3,18,Phineas,"Ferb, we're going to try and stop the portal!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),What? Oh!
3,18,Candace,"I was wrong, Stacy, about everything. I'm not a grown-up. I can't control mysterious forces. I can't even get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she smiles) Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom to see what my brothers are doing! (she runs off)"
3,18,Stacy,"Candace, where are you going?"
3,18,Candace,I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom! And I'm gonna fail!

3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz. You borrowed sugar from me this morning!"
3,18,Mrs. Thompson,I don't have any sugar. I had to borrow some from my neighbor this morning.
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that's me. That's..."
3,18,Mrs. Thompson,"Oh, he's a nice man, but I hear he's divorced."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, THAT she remembers."
3,18,Candace,"Psst, mom!"
3,18,Linda,"Candace, what are you doing here?"
3,18,Candace,You've got to come outside and bust the boys!
3,18,Linda,I'm not leaving now. The girl is about to forgive the guy for the clichéd misunderstanding... (a Normbot tears through the screen) After she battles these robots.
3,18,Lawrence,"Whoa, this 3-D is amazing!"
3,18,Isabella,"Ferb, we'll handle things down here! (she fires, hitting a bot) Go help Phineas!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh come on, you stupid thing, work! (the Normbots go back to normal and continue)"
3,18,Phineas,"Oh, so that dish must be what's controlling the robots! Maybe I don't need to close the portal if I can just take out that... (he sees the baseball launcher) Oh, yeah!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Oh no you don't! Ha ha! Now the baseball is on the other foot! Or however that... that saying goes. I'm not really sure... (sees Phineas backing up) Hey, hey! Where are you going? (he aims at Phineas, and backs him into a wall) You know, all that's going to happen from you guys coming up here is that I'm going to have a brand new Platyborg! And maybe even a Boyborg too, huh? Try saying that five times fast: boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg, boyborg... eh, I guess its not that hard to say, never mind."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"You know something kid, you've been a thorn in my side all day long..."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),(slow-mo) Noooooo!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"(regular) Augh! My babies! No, what have you done?"
3,18,Isabella,"It's weird that Perry's a secret agent, huh?"
3,18,Buford,"Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect."
3,18,Baljeet,Has anyone seen my pants?
3,18,Buford,"Yeah, they're over there."
3,18,Irving,WOLVERINES!
3,18,Candace,"Mom, if you care one iota about me, your family, and your city, you'll come outside with me right now!"
3,18,Linda,"Well, I guess I could use some more popcorn."
3,18,Candace,"Great! (she pulls her out) Come on, come on, come on!"
3,18,Phineas,"Ferb, bro! I just hit the best home run ever!"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Now, tremble before me! (laughs) No no, I'm down here."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,Hey!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),What? I'm kind of in the middle of something here! (we see the arm is less than an inch away from impact)
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,I got a little something just for you...
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),Choo-Choo!
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, it's mine. See, I told you I never lost it. It was in a box in my pantry labeled ""VHS Tapes"". Go figure. Anyway, you can have it."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you! (he takes it and hugs it close) Oh, heart melting, backstory resolving, evilness diminishing."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Eh, it's the least I can do."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"You know, I don't even know what I was thinking with the whole ""evil robots"" thing. Actually, when I look around, I-I'm really embarrassed. Here, let me clean this up."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, you."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Yeah, here we go."
3,18,Candace,"Come on, come on. Hurry! (she motions for her to look)"
3,18,Linda,Do I even need to say there's nothing there anymore?
3,18,Candace,"Mom, you can say it all you want! (hugs her and does a little dance) There's nothing there! Woo hoo! I did it, I saved the world! (she stops and smiles, pause) You can go back to your movie now."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"Yeah, you know, we're totally cool now, I'm just going to go back to my home and live out the rest of my days with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!"
3,18,Major Monogram (2nd Dimension),"Book him, ladies."
3,18,Doofenshmirtz (2nd Dimension),"You know, my crimes against humanity had just completely slipped my mind."
3,18,Candace,"Hey, did you guys just see that? I totally saved Danville!"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Good job, soldier."
3,18,Candace,"So, what will you do now?"
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"Wow, I haven't thought of anything but busting Doofenshmirtz for years. I don't know."
3,18,Candace,"Well, I know what interests I'd pursue. (she points to 2nd Dimension Jeremy as he comes out of the portal)"
3,18,Jeremy (2nd Dimension),"Hey, here you all are."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"I'll take that under consideration. And what about you, Candace?"
3,18,Candace,"You know, after all of this, I'm going to give myself a little more time to be young. It's not such a bad place to be."
3,18,Candace (2nd Dimension),"You know what, me too. (they hug)"
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Hey, I just wanted to say thanks for teaching us all about summer. You know, opening our horizons, and teaching Ferb classical guitar."
3,18,Phineas,Uh-oh.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),"Hey, it's our Perry! (they go over to him) Looks like the evil was fried right out of him."
3,18,Phineas,Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.
3,18,Phineas (2nd Dimension),Are you kidding? That makes him extra cool! Thanks so much guys. (they head back to the portal)
3,18,Phineas,I'm glad we could help.
3,18,Phineas,"Man, this was the greatest day ever. Imagine how much fun we can have together now that we know you're a secret agent!"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Yes yes, the next fifteen minutes should be a real hoot. Then, of course, Agent P will be sent away forever."
3,18,Phineas,What?
3,18,Major Monogram,Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
3,18,Phineas,We threw it away.
3,18,Major Monogram,Does anyone read those things?
3,18,Carl,"I tried to warn you, sir."
3,18,Major Monogram,"Kids, I'm sorry, but now that Agent P's cover has been blown, you won't be allowed to see him anymore."
3,18,Phineas,That's why you didn't want us to know your secret. (Perry nods) So we'll never see Perry again? There has to be another way!
3,18,Major Monogram,"Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe, you know too much."
3,18,Phineas,Now I never wished so much that I could un-know something.
3,18,Carl,"Sir, maybe there is a way. What about Dr. Doofenshmirtz's Amnesia-nator?"
3,18,Doofenshmirtz,I never built an Amnesia-nator. I think I'd remember building something like that.
3,18,Major Monogram,"Well, that might work, but you'd all have to agree."
3,18,Phineas,"So our choice is to: either forget the best day ever, forget the greatest adventure we've ever had, and forget meeting Agent P, or remember today, but never see Perry again?"
3,18,Ferb,"Well, we've had a lot of great days, but we only have one Perry."
3,18,Phineas,Agreed.
3,18,All,Yeah.
3,18,Major Monogram,"(from inside) Alright everybody, tall kids in the back. (zooms to the inside of the lab) Just need to do a little more programming here, and we'll be ready to roll."
3,18,Phineas,"Hey, buddy. Ferb and I just wanted to say our goodbyes. You know, we thought we'd met the real you when we found out you were Agent P. But the fact is, pet, secret agent, they're both the real you. You are now, and always have been a great pet, and a great friend. We're going to miss you, Agent P. (Perry hugs Ferb, then hugs Phineas) I love you, pal."
3,18,Carl,"Sir, are you crying?"
3,18,Major Monogram,"No, I'm sweating through my eyes."
3,18,Phineas,"Okay sir, we're ready. (They walk back. Perry walks up to Major Monogram.)"
3,18,Major Monogram,"Okay Carl, we're all set."
3,18,Isabella,"Uh, Major Monogram?"
3,18,Major Monogram,"(offscreen) Uh, yes?"
3,18,Isabella,"So, none of us will remember any of today?"
3,18,Major Monogram,That's right.
3,18,Isabella,"(firmly) Good. (she grabs him and kisses him right on the lips, Phineas gasps)"
3,18,Phineas,(surprised) Isabella!

3,3,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna build fast shoes, so we can run like a cheetah!"
3,3,Candace,"And I don't care. Because today, I'm going to Jeremy's family picnic in the park. I will be spending the whole day with my boyfriend and his extended family. And they are all going to love me, because today, I am Composed Candace. Confident, cool, and relaxed."
3,3,Linda,Candace...
3,3,Candace,AAAAAH! Stop judging me!!
3,3,Linda,Ready to head to the library?
3,3,Candace,Huh?
3,3,Linda,"You volunteered to read to the kids' book club today, while I help reorganize cookbooks."
3,3,Candace,"Oh, I forgot all about all about that! That's so unlike me! I never forget a promise! (Her cell phone rings. She picks up.) Hello?"
3,3,Stacy,Candace! We're about to go on! (cut back to Candace) Where are you?! Candace? (Candace smiles nervously.) Candace?! Are you there?!
3,3,Candace,(hangs up) Heh-heh. Wrong number.
3,3,Linda,We're leaving in fifteen.
3,3,Candace,Heh. Yeah. I've got nothing better to do.
3,3,Phineas,What about that Jeremy thing?
3,3,Candace,(storming out angrily) Don't you have a catchphrase to say or something?
3,3,Phineas,"What is she talking about? Hey, have you seen Perry around? (Ferb shrugs) 'Cause I haven't."
3,3,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. It's come to our attention that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has missed a few of his mortgage payments. He must be funneling all that money into something really evil, otherwise, he'd ask his ex-wife for a loan. (File photo of Charlene appears on screen.) She's loaded you know. Ka-ching! So get over there (Perry salutes) and find out what's going on. (he leaves)"
3,3,Phineas,"(voiceover) A cheetah's body is built to run at amazing speeds. By carefully analyzing our own bodies' running mechanics, we can now design and build our very own super shoes. Based on the pseudoscience of reflexology, these shoes will trigger pressure points in our feet, making us exponentially faster."
3,3,Candace,"I'm double-booked! If you count Stacy, I'm triple-booked! Oh, darn my endlessly giving nature! (Phineas speeds past the door.)"
3,3,Phineas,Woohoo!
3,3,Candace,(opening the door) Wha?
3,3,Phineas,"(speeding) Yeah! Hiiiiiii, Candaaaace! You know, Ferb, with these super shoes on, (running from one side to the other and back rapidly) we can almost be in two places at one time. (Ferb stops him) Let's go see what these babies can really do. (They speed out of the backyard.)"
3,3,Candace,Two places at once?

3,3,Woman,"Ooh, are those floors original?"

3,3,Doofenshmirtz,"The name is Doofenshmirtz! Like, like in Doofenshmirtz! (Perry tugs his lab coat) Now what? Oh, it's you. I'm sorry, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to have to take a rain check. You see, I'm having a bit of a financial crisis and I'm afraid I won't have time for our evil scheme today. (Perry tips his hat and leaves.) Yep. (sighs) Next time we fight, it could be in a cardboard box, 'cause that's where I'll be living. (Perry stops short and tugs Doof's lab coat again) Can't you see I'm trying to wallow? (Perry points to something) What? (Cut to a framed picture of Doof's ex-wife) That? Oh, it's a nice picture of Charlene, isn't it? But I don't think I could get much cash for it. I mean, who wants a picture... (Perry takes out a phone) Oh, you mean call her and ask her for money? Never! Y'know what she'll say if I call? She'll say, ""I told you so!"" And you know why? Because she told me so! She said, ""Don't get the gargoyles, Heinz!"" But what does she know? (Whip pan to reveal two gargoyles on the balcony) Gargoyles are a good investment. Name a cheap building with gargoyles. (Cut back to Doof and Perry) No way am I asking her for money! I—I—I'll just, uh, make this place unsellable! Then they'll have to let me stay here no matter how broke I am! (to a potential buyer) Psst! Indian burial ground. True story."
3,3,Phineas,Wow! These things are great! Much better than those completely unstable prototypes we made earlier.
3,3,Candace,What a ripoff! These things are—AAAAAAAAAAH!!! (She speeds away.)

3,3,Linda,"Oh, that's sweet. I think I'll watch for a while."
3,3,Candace,"Oh, you don't have to. (Linda takes a seat. Candace clears her throat and begins reading.) ""Smorky knew that it was wrong to steal the pie, but it looked so delicious. He knew his friend had worked hard to make the pie and bake the pie. How would Smorky's friend feel when he saw the pie was gone? He would feel sad. He would feel bad. He might even feel mad. But Smorky was so hungry. What could Smorky do? What should Smorky do? What would Smorky do?"""

3,2,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella, we're building a giant robot dog."
3,2,Baljeet,Like when we made that title sequence!
3,2,Buford,"Mmm, I'd rather give a monkey a shower."
3,2,Isabella,"So, uh, Phineas, I was wondering if maybe after this, you'd like to go to the premiere of the new Stumbleberry Finkbat movie."
3,2,Phineas,"(while rummaging through wires) Huh? Oh, sure. Sounds cool."
3,2,Ferb,(appears) I'd like to go to that.
3,2,Isabella,"Uh, sorry, I -- I only have one extra ticket, and...it's sold out. So, I thought maybe Phineas and I would go—uh, not to necerrally exclude --"
3,2,Phineas,"Yeah, I can go after we finish up here. Done with he wiring, Ferb?(Ferb produces a back scratcher and scratches the dog, causing its hind leg to rise and twitch)"
3,2,Phineas,"Lookin' good. Hey, where's Perry?"
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Comfortable, Perry the Platypus? I've made that platy-rack so that every limb is accounted for. So, what's it all about?"
3,2,"You see, there were only 2 things that made my miserable childhood bearable","my giant pet cockroach, Hoarfrost and garlic ice cream. I love these two things so much I wondered if combining them would exponentially increase my enjoyment of them."
3,2,Hoarfrost,So cold...
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,Yeah.
3,2,Hoarfrost,Ow...
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"So anyway, I remembered this little island timeshare that I bought on a free trip to Vegas. And, I realized that if I were to combine my tiny island with the Capitol of the Tri-State Area like so, ta-da! Then, legally, under local property laws, I will be sovereign ruler of the Tri-State Area! As long as I file the appropriate paperwork and get it in by the end of business today..."
3,2,Candace,(rings doorbell)
3,2,Mrs. Johnson,"(answers door) Oh, hello, Candace."
3,2,Candace,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson. Is Jeremy in?"
3,2,Mrs. Johnson,Come on in. He's right over there.
3,2,Candace,Is he okay?
3,2,Mrs. Johnson,"Oh, sure. He was just up all night working the graveyard shift at Mr. Slushy Burger after a full day shift. Then when he came home..."
3,2,Jeremy,(snoring)
3,2,Candace,"Thanks. Aw, look how cute he is when he's sleeping. (sits next to Jeremy) Psst, Jeremy?"
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, you've asked for it! (grabs Perry and they roll on the ground, knocking over the Combine-inator. The contraption fires off a ray that reaches a nearby park)"
3,2,Man,I hereby dedicate this giant prism--
3,2,"(the ray hits the prism, causing the former to redirect into two directions",one straight up into space and hitting a satellite and the other straight in the direction of Jeremy's house)
3,2,Candace,"...so Stacy and I just need a little girl time, and that's a--"
3,2,Phineas,"Tail wag solenoids, check. Slipper chewing radio controlled by cuspids, check."
3,2,Isabella,"(sighs) Hey, Phineas? What'cha still doooin'?"
3,2,Phineas,"Just going through a last minute checklist, now that the dog is done."
3,2,Isabella,"Oh! Does that mean we can, uh, go to the movies?"
3,2,Phineas,Hey Ferb! Let's fire this puppy up!
3,2,Phineas,(to Isabella) I don't see why not.
3,2,Isabella,"Great, we can still catch the matinee!"
3,2,Candace,Phineas! (enters backyard) What have you done?!
3,2,Phineas,"Well, we've made this giant robotic--"
3,2,Candace,Just look at us! We are all fused together! (close up of her) See?! I don't care what kind of freaky project you guys are doing! Just get us unstuck!
3,2,Baljeet,"We could remove you to a sterile environment and get a board certified surgeon to cleanly, and safely preform a gerabotamy."
3,2,Buford,"We could tie each of you to a monster truck, and drive in opposite directions, worst case scenario, someone loses a torso."
3,2,Phineas,"Or, we can use the molecular separator."
3,2,Candace,That thing you used to separate me from me?
3,2,Phineas,"Yeah! It worked before. You know, in a completely different set of circumstances."
3,2,Candace,Great you guys get on it. (Her phone rings) H-Hey Stacy.
3,2,Stacy,"Hey BFF, just checking on your ETA."
3,2,Candace,About that-
3,2,Stacy,Oh no! You had better not be ditching me to hang out with Jeremy again!
3,2,Candace,"What? On Street Fair day? Haha! No way, sister! I'll be there, and I'll be there early. Ah-haha. Yeah. Alone. Okay? Okay. (She hangs up) Oh crud. Make that molecular whatever and meet me at the coffee shop!"
3,2,Isabella,"Yeah, but the movie almost started --"
3,2,Candace,"(overlapping, leaves) And don't be late! THIS IS YOUR FAULT!"
3,2,Phineas,"I don't know what she's talking about Ferb, but I do know the next thing we're gonna do today! Let's get started on the separator."
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(Doofenshmirtz and Perry circle each other) So here we are, just the two of us at a stalemate. Each looking for something to turn the tide, but what will it be?"
3,2,Norm,(He walks in carrying a large tray of cupcakes) Cupcakes?
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Oop! Watch this! (He leaps on to the -inator, activating it, then jumps into Norm's arms) Prepare to face the wrath of Normenshmirtz! (Normenshmirtz fires laser at Perry) You can't get away from me now!"
3,2,Norm,Don't you mean us?
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, don't step on my moment."
3,2,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb better find a fix for this—Oh!! (Candace sees Stacy, and to hide Jeremy, she pulls up a chair, and throws a tablecloth over him)"
3,2,Stacy,Hey girlfriend!
3,2,Candace,Oh hey Stace!
3,2,Stacy,"(To the waiter) Two ice teas please. So, Candace, sorry I was so hard on you before. I know you and Jeremy aren't together all the time."
3,2,Candace,"No, really it's okay. It's nice to have a little space from him. Oh look our drinks."
3,2,Waiter,Two ice teas.
3,2,Candace and Stacy,Thanks.
3,2,Candace,"(She covers up Jeremy's lips to stop him from snoring) So, I here there's a ton of vintage clothing stalls at the street fair this year."
3,2,Stacy,"Yeah, I'm looking for some really cool... Wow, this table's really lumpy."
3,2,Candace,"Yeah, lumpy tables. It's the new ""hip"" thing. It's so European."
3,2,Jeremy,(moaning) Uhhhh...
3,2,Candace,"(desperately) Uhhh... ♪ Do the Moan, Moan! Yeah! Do the Moan! ♪ Come on, Stace, don't you love that song? ♪ Do the Moan! ♪"
3,2,Candace,Hey isn't that that guy from that movie.
3,2,Stacy,What? Where? I don't see him! What guy?
3,2,Candace,(To Jeremy) ♪ Lullaby and goodnight da-da-da-da♪
3,2,Stacy,I don't see anyone.
3,2,Candace,That's because he's gone.
3,2,Stacy,"Candace, why are you acting so nervous? I'm not mad anymore. I'm going to go pay for our drinks. (She leaves)"
3,2,Candace,"Okay. (Stacy returns, and Candace has on a big overcoat to hide Jeremy) Ready?"
3,2,Stacy,"Candace, why are you wearing that coat?"
3,2,Candace,"Brr, that ice tea gave me a chill."
3,2,Stacy,"Okay, let's go, but you're walking behind me."
3,2,Candace,"Okie-doke! (She pulls out her phone) Phineas will you hurry, we're heading to the street fair already."
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,I think we're in trouble.
3,2,Norm,"Sure, now it's ""we""."
3,2,Phineas,Ta-da! Representing the molecular separator! I can't believe how fast we rebuilt this Ferb. Of course breaking the immutable law of physics is always easier the second time around.
3,2,Isabella,Great! Does that mean we can go to the movies now?
3,2,Phineas,"Sure does. The movie theatre is right next to the street fair. All we've got to do is get this to Candace, and separate her from Jeremy."
3,2,Isabella,Well what are we waiting for?
3,2,Ferb,I believe were waiting for Rover to put the molecular separator down.
3,2,Isabella,Hey!
3,2,Phineas,Come back here boy!
3,2,Buford,This would have never happened if we'd given a monkey a shower. I'm just sayin'.
3,2,Song,"""Just the Two of Us"""
3,2,Norm,Hey! That hurt!
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,Ahh! He's armed!
3,2,Norm,With my arm!
3,2,Norm,Balsa wood?
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,It was on sale. It's locked into overload.
3,2,Norm,"(Opening the door to the refrigerator) Would you like a nice, frosty beverage?"
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,Hey! (He closes the door) That's private!
3,2,Phineas,Split up guys. Maybe we can corner him.
3,2,Phineas and Isabella,(After cutting Rover off) A-ha!
3,2,Buford and Baljeet,A-ha!
3,2,Buford,He's coming your way!
3,2,Candace,"I'm running out of hiding places. (She spies a dressing room, and hides Jeremy behind the curtain)"
3,2,Stacy,"Hey! I found all kinds of cute things! Move over, I'm going to try them on."
3,2,Candace,No! Uh... I can see they fit you perfectly.
3,2,Stacy,Candace! Are you karate-chopping me?! What's going on?
3,2,Phineas,"Heal boy! (Rover stops) Go ferb! (Ferb runs up, and yanks a few wires out from Rover, causing him to shut down and drop the molecular seperator from his mouth)"
3,2,Phineas,(Slow motion) No!
3,2,Candace,(Slow motion) No!
3,2,Isabella and Buford,(Slow motion) No!
3,2,Baljeet,How is everyone doing that?!
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,"(Now disconnected) Hey, I can feel my knees again!"
3,2,Norm,I'm sorry.
3,2,Doofenshmirtz,So cold...
3,2,Candace,"Okay, listen Stacy, there was this blast, and I was sitting next to Jeremy, and somehow we got--"
3,2,Stacy,Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy. Tell me later I want to try this on.
3,2,Candace,"Stacy, honest I really wanted to spend the day with you but... (She sees that there Jeremy isn't in the booth) But...? But? And we were? Uh... never mind."
3,2,Jeremy,Candace?
3,2,Candace,Jeremy!
3,2,Jeremy,"I know this is a weird question, but do you have any idea how I got here."
3,2,Candace,"Jeremy, don't worry, I promise I'll explain everything later, but right now you've gotta get out of here. (pushes him away) I'll call you later...I mean, tomorrow. Phew..."
3,2,Stacy,"(peeks out from dressing room) By the way, the best part was when you used him as a table. (closes curtain) BUSTED!"
3,2,Isabella,"So, we, uh, got everything sorted out now."
3,2,Phineas,"Yeah, want to catch that movie?"
3,2,Isabella,Oh Phineas...
3,2,Phineas,"(To Ferb) Okay, bro, I guess I'll see you back at the house."
3,2,Isabella,Oh. My. Gosh.
3,2,Phineas,Hey! Does this mean we can all go now?
3,2,Ferb,Yes. Yes it does.
3,19,Phineas,"You were right, Ferb. It is more fun to mount the race track on the ceiling. (At Buford and Baljeet) Hey, guys. Care to join us for an upside-down slot bike race?"
3,19,Baljeet,No thank you. I am not a big fan of bicycle racing.
3,19,Phineas,"Ah, come on. Everyone loves a good bike race."
3,19,Baljeet,"Not me. You see, I come from a long line of bicycle race losers."
3,19,(Song,"Rubber Bands, Rubber Balls instrumental)"
3,19,Baljeet,"(Narrating) In 1903, my great-grandfather was leading a bicycle race, but he fell into a tiger pit. Years later, my grandfather skillfully avoided the tiger pit, but sadly not the tiger. Then, my father was confident he had outsmarted the tiger, but he was wrong."
3,19,Baljeet,"My point is, none of them finished in the top ten."
3,19,Phineas,"You know, tiger attacks are comparatively rare in Danville since we installed that tiger excluder on city hall."
3,19,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what Baljeet is gonna do today!"
3,19,Linda,"Hey, Candace. I was just heading out to Margie's baby shower and look what I found on the stoop."
3,19,Candace,My new camcorder! Sport edition. For bustin' on the go.
3,19,Linda,"Yeah, well; gotta run. Margie won't stay pregnant forever. Don't forget to feed Perry."
3,19,Candace,Where's Perry?
3,19,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. We've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's Internet traffic and we think it's... (A pop-up ad blocks him) What in blazes? A pop-up ad? Can you still see me, Agent P? (Another pop-up ad blocks him) What, another? Agent P? Over here! (More pop-up ads block the screen) Oh, this is getting ridiculous! I give"
3,19,Phineas,"Here it is. The route of the 1st annual Tour de Ferb bike race. Featuring jumps, obstacles, rickety staircases, and here's where you start the second stretch of the underwater..."
3,19,Baljeet,Wait; underwater?
3,19,Phineas,We tricked the bikes out a little. Just push the button on your handle bars when you encounter any unusual terrain.
3,19,Baljeet,What about tiger attacks?
3,19,Phineas,"Technically, that's not a terrain. Isabella was kind enough to enlist the help of the Fireside Girls to make the course, guide us, and help out along the way."
3,19,Buford,"More racey, less talky. (Jumps onto his bike) Sweet!"
3,19,Isabella,Race ya to the front-line!
3,19,Phineas,You're on!
3,19,Baljeet,"Well, it does seem to indicate a pattern."
3,19,Phineas,Just remember you have something that they didn't have. Greg LeMond! (Whistles)
3,19,Greg LeMond,"I'm back here! (At Baljeet) Hiya, Baljeet. I'm Greg LeMond, the first American cyclist to win the Tour de France. Three times, actually."
3,19,Baljeet,"So, like recently?"
3,19,Greg LeMond,That's not the point. The point is I see a kid who needs inspiration.
3,19,Baljeet,"Oh, you mean me, right?"
3,19,Greg LeMond,"That's right, Baljeet. Don't let anything stop you. There's nothing in this world that you can't do."
3,19,Baljeet,"Actually, I can think of many things I can not do. Flying comes to mind. Also putting my foot behind my head, but it occurs to me that you're speaking hyperbolically. So point taken, Greg LeMond! I'm going to win this race!"
3,19,Greg LeMond,That's the spirit! (Baljeet bikes off) U-S-A! U-S-A!
3,19,Baljeet,(Off screen) I am from India!
3,19,(Song,"Go, Go, Phineas instrumental)"
3,19,Holly,Ready...set....
3,19,Buford,(Laughs) Losers!
3,19,Holly,...Go!
3,19,Buford,What the...? No fair! You've got that aerodynamic head!
3,19,Baljeet,Indi-a! Indi-a!
3,19,Candace,"(singsong) Oh, Phineas? Ferb? (Notices the route map) Tour de Ferb? (Takes it from the fence) Oh, baby! Ee-ee-ee-ee..."
3,19,(Song,Bust is in the Bag)
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"(Cackles) Welcome, Perry the Platypus. I knew you would fall for the old kickstand trap. (Scratches an ear) Of course, I didn't know exactly where you've parked, so I... (Camera pans back showing that he had installed more than one button) really got to watch my step around here. But as you see, you're trapped... in a pile of old computer cables."
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"I've started throwing them in a drawer years ago, and I'm... I'm sure there's probably one wire you can pull like a... (Camera pans back to Perry) like a lube-bearing wire that would just make the whole thing unravel. But how you find it? (Camera switches back to him) I'd figured it would be easier to use it as a trap, so I did. See? Recycling."
3,19,Buford,"Uh, oh! Big round wet thing comin' up!"
3,19,Phineas,"Press your buttons, everybody!"
3,19,Buford,(Press button on his bike) Awesome!
3,19,Baljeet,I can feel my competitive spirit breaking free! (Bike hits a tree stump then he falls into the water)
3,19,Phineas,"Don't give up, Baljeet!"
3,19,Baljeet,(Stands up; shaking a fist) Never!
3,19,Greg LeMond,"(Rising from the water, bike in one hand) Baljeet, you're not quitting, are you?"
3,19,Baljeet,"No, sir, Mr. LeMond. (Retrieves bike from the water then raises it over his head) I came to win!"
3,19,Greg LeMond,I know things are tough. There's a little voice telling you to quit.
3,19,Baljeet,I hear no voice.
3,19,Greg LeMond,But you can quit.
3,19,Baljeet,But I do not want to quit!
3,19,Greg LeMond,"Hey; true story. Hunting accident. My brother-in-law thought I was a turkey. (Imitates turkey) Kaboom! But I recovered, and you can too."
3,19,Baljeet,Wow; I have no idea how to respond that. (Pauses) I think I will be continuing on with the race now.
3,19,Greg LeMond,"Dropping out seems like an easy way, but years from now I don't want you to look back and wonder ""What if?""."
3,19,Candace,"Out of my way, turkey!"
3,19,Greg LeMond,Why does everyone think I'm a turkey?
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"So, Perry the Platypus. Let me tell you my latest scheme. The other day, I was browsing the Internet when..."
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"(Narrating) I came to an online auction for a Super Multi-inator. I wasn't even sure what it did, but you know Zupermuhltienator was my grandmother's maiden name. It was a sign. I had to have it, but then something terrible happened. A pop-up ad kept me from hitting the ""Bid now"" button. It really hit me where I lived too. You see, I always hated advertising ever since the early '80s when I did a little product modeling to finance my first -Inator."
3,19,Photographer,That's it. Hold the wombat a little closer to your face.
3,19,Photographer,Closer. A little closer.
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,(Narrating) I don't want to talk about it. But then I realized I could use pop-up ads to serve all of my evil ends.
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,So I come up with a whole slew of products and services I that could advertise and my Pop-up-inator would (Snaps fingers) put thousands of pop-up ads virtually everywhere! I'll make millions!
3,19,(Song,Tour de Ferb)
3,19,Candace,Right on schedule and fully documented.
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"The best part is that pop-up ads would never go away. There's a little button that says ""Click here to close"", (Camera pans to Perry) but guess what? It just opens another pop-up ad! (Camera switches to him) (Laughs) Pop-up ad. Best idea ever."
3,19,Female voice,Analyzing pile. .... Locating load-bearing wire.
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,"What? .... Perry the Platypus! How did you get out? .... Aaah! .... Ow! Hey! Not fair! .... Oof! ... Alright, no more Mr. Nice Guy! .... Come back here, you little... (Accidentally presses one of the buttons; wires fall on him; he brushes them off) See? I told you I got to watch my step in here. (Pushes another button; gets trapped by wires; more falls on his head to create a turban; even more completely covers him) I know what you're thinking, but this is neither ironic nor funny. (Pauses) Are you... Are you still there?"
3,19,Candace,"(in a sarcastic tone) Hello, mother. Have a nice time at the baby shower?"
3,19,Linda,"Well; Margie's got morning sickness, so there was a little incident."
3,19,Candace,Ew.
3,19,Linda,"But now I'm clean, so no harm done. And I can see you're dying to tell me something."
3,19,Candace,"Uh.... Not really. It's just.... Mom, (Beam from the Pop-up-Inator hits Candace's camcorder) take a look at this."
3,19,Phineas,(on screen) Ok --
3,19,Linda,Your camera gets pop-up ads?
3,19,Candace,What?! Nooooo!!! But it doesn't matter. (tosses camcorder in sink; picks up Linda) I know where the last obstacle is. Hee-hee-hee-hee...
3,19,Linda,"Whoa! Whoa! (gets placed in the bike basket) Candace, I'm not even dressed!"
3,19,Candace,"Sorry Mom, it's an emergency!"
3,19,Linda,"Luckily, (reveals bike helmet under turban) I've picked today to wear my bike helmet into the shower."
3,19,Baljeet,"Ah! There it is! The finish line, right on the other side of Danville Chasm. I am going to win this!"
3,19,Buford,Not if I can help it!
3,19,Linda,Candace! My towel!
3,19,Candace,Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
3,19,Candace,(With her eyes closed) Get ready to see something really terrifying!
3,19,Linda,That's better. (notices the billboard) Huh. I guess that is pretty scary. That guy should not be holding a wombat so close to his face.
3,19,Candace,But-but-but-but-but-but...but...but...buuuuut...
3,19,Doofenshimrtz,"(while Perry's pushing the Pop-up-Inator towards the balcony) Perry the Platypus, wire you're doing this to me? Get it? Wire? Because, I mean wire. Ah, come on. Now; I know I'm defeated, but at least I got a good joke out of it. Show me some love. (pauses) Nothing? Really?"
3,19,Doofenshmirtz,Just going to leave me hanging here?
3,19,Buford,"Ah, ah! Losers!"
3,19,Baljeet,"""Ah, ah"" yourself. I am going to win this race! Oooohh! I am tasting victory! It is sweet as... (Greg LeMond quickly passes him) Greg LeMond? I thought you were supposed to be motivating me."
3,19,Greg LeMond,"It worked so well, that I even motivated myself. Finish line, here I... (a tiger leaps on top of him) Ahhh!"
3,19,Ferb,They need to change the battery on the tiger excluder.
3,19,Phineas,"Boy, I'll say."
3,19,Baljeet,"I did it! I won a bike race! Thanks to Greg LeMond inspiring me. And then, you know, getting attacked by that tiger. By the way, I hope he is okay."
3,19,Greg LeMond,"Oh, man. I got to call my brother-in-law and tell him that his tiger got out."
3,19,(Song,Tour de Ferb)
3,25,Lawrence,(from inside) Nice to see you boys down here at the shop!
3,25,Phineas,Wow! What's that thing?
3,25,Lawrence,"Oh, this? It's an escape chamber from an old vaudeville show. In the old days, men would go into these things and pretend to be locked inside and then they would ""escape"" to the amazement of the crowd. Here, let me show you. (goes inside the chamber) You see? All you need to do is just... (tries to escape) Uh.... Hmm..."
3,25,Phineas,"You need a little help, Dad?"
3,25,Lawrence,"Well, no, no, I just need to, um... Oh! (Ferb helps him out) There we go. Thanks, son."
3,25,Lawrence,"Well, I've got bottle caps to polish. (walks away) Hmhm!"
3,25,Phineas,(at Ferb) Dude! I know what we're gonna do today!
3,25,Linda,"Oh, no. I'm late for my introduction to ice sculpture. (Writes a note and goes outside to Candace sleeping on the hammock) I suppose there's no need to wake her. (puts the note on her head, then leaves)"
3,25,Candace,(snoring)
3,25,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"" (lullaby version))"
3,25,Candace,(mumbling in sleep) Where's Perry?
3,25,Carl,And the salad fork is the one on the outside.
3,25,Major Monogram,(holding a clipboard and pen) And you're certain of that... (Perry's chair slides forward) Ah! Agent P!
3,25,Major Monogram,"As you may know, this is International Good Manners Day. Perhaps, not ironically, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has chosen this very week to create a device that causes rampant rudeness. Go take care of it."
3,25,Major Monogram,If you please.
3,25,Carl,(while Perry leaves his lair) I bet he calls it the Rude-inator.
3,25,Major Monogram,What does that make you? Nostradamus?
3,25,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! My brother and I are here today to give you a thrilling display of escapement arts as we attempt, to extricate ourselves from this,..."
3,25,Phineas,...the most complicated trap ever devised by man or child! A computer controlled tower so fiendishly clever that...
3,25,Phineas,...its blueprints had to be viewed in a smoked mirror to avoid driving its creators insane!
3,25,Isabella,"Wow, he's really selling it hard."
3,25,Baljeet,"But if you designed the tower, will you not know every way to get out?"
3,25,Phineas,"(taps tower with cane) We programmed it to learn as it goes, so it's conceivable we could be trapped in there forever. (taps tower with cane again) Coming with?"
3,25,Isabella,"Yes! I mean, no./Baljeet: No!"
3,25,Isabella/Baljeet,No.
3,25,Buford,It sounds ill-advised.
3,25,Phineas,That's okay. You guys can stay out here and be the cheering section with Candace.
3,25,Candace,(snoring) Must bust Phineas and Ferb.
3,25,Baljeet,But what if you do not come out?
3,25,Phineas,"If we're not out in 15 minutes, you can smash the machine and rescue us, just like in the old days."
3,25,Buford,(brings out mallet) Sounds like a party.
3,25,Phineas,Ferb? Start the timer please!
3,25,Buford,Synchronizing watches!
3,25,Phineas,"(he and Ferb walks onto an elevator) Women and children and the faint of heart may wish (pushes button with cane) to leave now. (as the elevator rises up) So we bid you adieu! Goodbye! Auf wiedersehen! Farewell, friends!"
3,25,Phineas,And we'll see you in a few minutes! Or not at all!
3,25,Baljeet,"Legally speaking, what is our liability here?"
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"A-ha! I wanted to say something clever about ""cat got your tongue"", but I haven't worked it out. You see, when we were small children, my brother Roger was always better at the whole manners and etiquette thing."
3,25,Young Roger,"Sweet Aunt Effie, you have always been my favorite!"
3,25,Aunt Effie,"(pinching young Roger's cheek) Roger, so polite. (hands young Roger a coin) Heinz?"
3,25,Young Doofenshmirtz,That's some mole!
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"(sighs) It takes a long time to clean out a chicken coop with a spoon. And I still don't see how that was rude. I mean, that thing was gargantuan. If anything, I was showing restraint. Anyway, today, it is International Good Manners Day, and we've got a visiting dignitary. She's the ambassador from England! Only the most etiquetty country in the whole world, hello! And when Roger's introducing her I'm going to zap him with my Rude-inator!"
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,That's what I'm calling it.
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"It makes whoever it zaps intolerably rude! He'll cause an international incident! And in all the confusion, I'll just waltz in and take over. So, why the catsuit? Well, we're going to be at City Hall to watch the fireworks, you and me, and I figured a platypus in a fedora might attract too much attention! Smart, huh? (walks away with a smug look) See, me, always thinking."
3,25,Phineas,"Good day to you, Tower. We're ready to begin."
3,25,Tower,"Welcome, boys. We're gonna have so much fun together. (puts strait-jackets on the boys) Put on your coats and stay a while."
3,25,Phineas,Strait-jackets. Classic. Ready?
3,25,Phineas,"Okay, shake me out."
3,25,Phineas,Awesome!
3,25,Phineas,(after Ferb shakes his strait-jacket off) This is gonna be fun.
3,25,Phineas,"I don't know, Ferb, I think we should ""file"" (pulls out a file) this under Dungeon Escape."
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, here we are! (chuckles) Right up close! You sit here, Perry the Catypus. (laughs) I just came up with that. That totally makes up for missing the ""cat got your tongue"" thing from before."
3,25,Roger,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to City Hall on this fine first day of National Etiquette Week."
3,25,Woman,I do love proper etiquette!
3,25,Phineas,"Hmm. Big keys, tiny doors. We're not fitting through any of those, but maybe that one!"
3,25,Phineas,"Ferb, you're a genius!"
3,25,Tower,"Nice warm up, boys."
3,25,Tower,But can you escape the relentless pull of gravity?
3,25,Phineas,(screaming) It's the Bottomless Pit Trap. (he and Ferb high fives)
3,25,"(Outside in the backyard, the timer first shows 11","27, then 11:26, and finally 11:25. The camera then pans to Baljeet, who's placing a pyramid of playing cards on the sleeping Candace.)"
3,25,Baljeet,It would be terrible if they did not come out!
3,25,Isabella,I know! (squirts some shaving cream on Candace's head)
3,25,Buford,I'm countin' on it.
3,25,Roger,"And to speak further on this topic, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Ambassador from England, the most etiquetty country in the world..."
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,Told you!
3,25,Roger,"... and my personal friend,"
3,25,Roger,...this unbelievable windbag right here.
3,25,Roger,"Oh, man! On and on and on in the limo over here. (mimicking ambassador) ""Manners are so important."""
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Can you believe this, Perry the..."
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Perry the Platypus. I told you to go before we left. (at himself) He better bring back some popcorn, that's all I can say."
3,25,Roger,...what a pompous know-it-all you are.
3,25,Woman,That's it! I want a recall.
3,25,All,Recall! Recall! Recall!
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,(grinning) It's working!
3,25,Phineas,Wait! I've got it. Give me your hands.
3,25,Phineas,"Come on, Tower!"
3,25,Phineas,Is that the best you can can throw at us?
3,25,Tower,"(rudely) Ooh, so special. I don't give a flying buttress."
3,25,Phineas,"Tower, are you feeling okay?"
3,25,Tower,"Oh, what's it to you?"
3,25,Phineas,"Oh, nothing, nothing."
3,25,Phineas,I thought we programmed you to be more polite than this.
3,25,Tower,"You think you're so sharp, don't you?"
3,25,Tower,I'm gonna show you something sharper.
3,25,Phineas,I think there may be something wrong with the Tower. I'm taking suggestions here.
3,25,Phineas,"Okay, dude, don't show off."
3,25,(Song,"""Breakin' Out"")"
3,25,(Backyard; the timer first shows 00,"25, and then 00:24. Baljeet's now about to put one of Candace's hands into a bowl of water.)"
3,25,Baljeet,"Oh, my gosh! It is almost time."
3,25,Isabella,(placing objects between Candace's toes) What if they can't get out?
3,25,Buford,(drawing an eye on the sticky note) How come you guys didn't tell me about this before?
3,25,Candace,Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.
3,25,Phineas,Made it. Boy! That was close.
3,25,Baljeet,Was it scary?
3,25,Isabella,Was it hard?
3,25,Buford,Do I still get to smash the tower?
3,25,Tower,I ain't done with you yet. (activates a force field around its lower half)
3,25,Buford,Wow! I thought I had a bad attitude.
3,25,Audience,Recall! Recall!
3,25,Roger,...and so's your sister!
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,Wow! Such rudeness. This is working better than I ever imagined.
3,25,Roger,"Miss High-and-Mighty English Manners Person, I have got one thing to say to you. And only one thing. That's some..."
3,25,Roger,"...show we just put on, isn't it, Madam Mayor?"
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,What the...
3,25,Ambassador,"You see, your wonderful Mayor and I agreed in the limousine to put on this little play for your edification."
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"(pushing button on remote repeatedly) No, no, no, no."
3,25,Ambassador,"Indeed, what would we be without manners?"
3,25,Audience,Four more years. Four more years.
3,25,Doofenshmirtz,"(pause) Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I didn't even get my popcorn. (realizes) Wait. If they were faking it, what did my ray hit?"
3,25,Tower,"Ooh, it looks like you two losers are still trapped. Might as well change your address, 'cause you're gonna be receiving your pension in here. Oopsie, activated my vacuum circuits. You dummies don't need air, do you? (blows raspberry)"
3,25,Phineas,I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror.
3,25,Buford,"Don't worry, I'll get you out in just a sec."
3,25,Buford,You guys are on your own.
3,25,Phineas,"Well, thanks for trying I guess."
3,25,Buford,No problem. What are friends for?
3,25,Tower,Friends? I have been programmed to trap you and your friends.
3,25,Phineas,"Oh, yeah!"
3,25,Baljeet,"Do me a favor. Next time you wanna make a fiendishly clever computer-controlled contraption, call one of your other friends."
3,25,Phineas,Hey! That's it. (at the tower) Tower. You were programmed to trap Ferb and me and our friends. But we've got friends all over Danville.
3,25,Tower,Is that so?
3,25,Phineas,"In fact, we have friends all over the Tri-State Area."
3,25,Tower,"Well, aren't we popular?"
3,25,Ferb,Plus there was that small matter of circumnavigating the globe.
3,25,Phineas,"You're right. Tokyo, Paris, Nepal. We have friends all over the Earth."
3,25,Tower,"Look at me, I have got friends all over the Earth. All right then."
3,25,Phineas,"In fact, we even have an alien friend named Meap."
3,25,Phineas,"He is from another planet. So, really, we have friends all over the galaxy."
3,25,Tower,A small matter for one such as me.
3,25,Tower,You will never escape. Never!
3,25,Baljeet,That works for me.
3,25,Buford,"Well, they only make mallets so big."
3,25,Isabella,See ya.
3,25,Phineas,"So, the entire galaxy. (grins) That enough elbow room for ya?"
3,25,Ferb,"Well, for today."
3,25,Alien,"At last, after two millennia, we finally reached the Milky Way Galaxy. Battle stations! We begin our assault in three, two... Oh!"
3,25,Alien,"Uh, anybody got a mallet?"
3,31,Carl,"Well, how are we doing today, Major? Feeling better?"
3,31,Major Monogram,Carl? What are you doing here?
3,31,Carl,Your wife said it'd be okay if I came up here and kept you company. Would that be all right? I brought a book!
3,31,Major Monogram,What kind of book?
3,31,Carl,(Somewhat excitedly) It's a fantasy adventure with wizards and knights!
3,31,Major Monogram,Are there woodland sprites?
3,31,Carl,"Well, there's water sprites."
3,31,Major Monogram,(After a short pause) Go ahead.
3,31,Carl,"(Begins reading) Devote your mind to this tale of the distant past, and the adventures that did befall the most noble of knights. (Scene ripples into a scene of a medieval cottage) Where stood the cottage of the humble antique dealer..."
3,31,Laurence,"Cheerio, dear! I'm off to hide these common objects for a couple'a hundred years, until they become valuable."
3,31,Linderella,"Don't forget to put hay in the ox! (goes inside and begins to do chores) Candavere! I need you to fetch me some more water! Candavere! Oh, where is that maid?"
3,31,Candavere,"Stachilda, news have I upon this evening. At the harvest bonfire I shall be on the arm of Jeremiad. Signed, Candavere. (Finishes writing) There! And now to send off this missive. (Ties letter to pigeon's foot) The time has come to do your duty, my stout-winged messenger! (Releases pigeon out the window, and it flies off, and is burnt up as a column of fire shoots out of the alchemy stove)"
3,31,Phineas,"That should catalyze it. We'll add it to our inventory of magical elixirs. What say we try a couple of these out? (They both take a potion and Ferbalot pours his on himself, turning into a cyclops) Cool, a cyclops! My turn! (Pours his potion on himself) A manticore! With a lion's head. (Ferbalot takes another potion) A cockatrice!"
3,31,Candavere,"(Singing) Oh yeah, getting some water, and (Slams into door) Yack! ...Gonna have a great Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire's Eve. (Sees Phineas) Good morrow, Phineas! (Begins singing again) ...With Jeremiad. (sees Ferbalot) Good morrow, Ferbalot! (Realizes what the boys are up to) Grr! What flaxen homespun have we swaggering here?!"
3,31,Phineas,"Careful, Candavere. Better not look at Ferbalot, or you'll turn to stone. (Ferbalot has turned into a Gorgon)"
3,31,Candavere,"This is a most inopportune time for your infernal hijinks, and for once our sad sweet mother will be heralded to your inpropri- Argh, I can't talk like this anymore! You guys are so busted! Mom! (running into the house, she slams into the door again) Yack! (goes into house and slams door)"
3,31,Phineas,"I don't know about you, Ferbalot, but I didn't get any of that. (They both pour a potion on themselves and return to normal; it begins to rain) Hey, there's something fishy about this rain. It's...it's unearthly. Come on, we better get inside."
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,(Bursts out of a puddle) Behold! I am the Lady of the Puddle!
3,31,Phineas,Don't you mean the Lady of the Lake?
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,"No, that's my mom."
3,31,Lady of the Lake,"Hey, kids! You're getting a little quest of your own. Oh, that's so nice."
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,"Anyway...Ferbalot, you and Phineas must find the legendary sword Excaliferb and use it to stop the evil sorcerer Malifishmirtz, who is behind this unearthly rain."
3,31,Phineas,"Yeah, Ferb and I were just talking about the rain. Unearthly—that's...isn't that the word I used? Yeah, I used—I just--"
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,"I will send the magical water sprite, Isabel, to guide you on your quest."
3,31,Phineas,Great! Can't wait to meet her.
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,"And to you, Ferbalot and Phineas, I bid thee good fortune! (turns into a wave of water and splashes on the boys)"
3,31,Phineas,"Wow, good thing she wasn't ""Lady of the Hot Coffee."" (at Linda) Mom! Ferb and I are going on a quest."
3,31,Linderella,(from inside the cottage) Don't forget to goad the geese on your way out!
3,31,Phineas,"Sure thing, mom. (at a goose) Get in there, Gertrude!"
3,31,Phineas,"(opens the gate door) Whoa! This must be the sprite, Isabel!"
3,31,Isabel,What art thou doin'? (curtseys)
3,31,Phineas,Apparently you're going to guide us on a quest.
3,31,Isabel,"Yes. You must first cross the Raging River of Uncertainty by way of the Bridge of Comprehension. Then you must brave the Swamp of Spit-Poor Attitudes; then it's snack time, I brought along some apples. After that, you will enter the Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters, where the sword Excaliferb can be found. (at Ferbalot) Ferb, only a warrior with a true heart may draw it from the stone and wield it in battle against the evil sorcerer Malifishmirtz."
3,31,Ferbalot,"(after a short pause) Yeah, okay, I'm down with that."
3,31,Isabel,(at Phineas) Do you have any questions?
3,31,Phineas,"Yeah, where's Parable?"
3,31,Monopunzel,"Good morning Sir P. (the feather in Parable's hat shoots out) The tempest we're experiencing was conjured up by the evil Malifishmirtz, we need you to fly up to his evil fortress and put the kibosh on his evil machinations."
3,31,Major Monogram,I really like that character; is there going to be more about him?
3,31,Carl,"I'm sorry, sir, he just comes in at the beginning. Shall I continue? (Major Monogram mumbles under his breath) Huh?"
3,31,Major Monogram,OK.
3,31,Carl,"Meanwhile, back at the cottage of the humble antique dealer..."
3,31,Candavere,"Mom, I'm telling you; they're gallivanting around out there conjuring things with magical elixirs."
3,31,Linderella,"Candavere, I've never see them gallivant."
3,31,Candavere,(sighs in frustration) When are you going to believe me? What if I got you some proof?
3,31,Linderella,I'd rather you got me some more grulewood.
3,31,Candavere,"Fine. (leaves the cottage, talks to herself) Candavere, fetch me grulewood. Candavere, rake the roof-thatch. Candavere, go accuse the neighbors of witchcraft. If only I had some (sees the potions) proof! (grabs two of them) All I have to do is grab a couple of these to show Mom and (trips causing the potions to spill on her) Oof! Ugh. What is this stuff? (a unicorn horn appears on her head) Ahh, stupid potion! I know, maybe this will get rid of it. (pours another potion on her head) That didn't work. I'm going to go tell Mom. (turns around and sees a tail) Aaugh! Oh, great a tail! Phineas and Ferbalot, you are so bu.. (breaths fire) I can't go to the Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire like this. What will Jeremiad think? I'm just gonna have to find Phineas and Ferb and make them tell me which one of these elixirs will change me back. (grabs some potions and runs, but trips again causing all of them to spill on her making different colored smoke to appear) Ah! Oh this is not, oh no. Oh. Oh, there's a... oh no. Oh..."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Ah-ha! Parable the Dragonpus, welcome to your doom! (aims his staff to shoot magic at Parable but doesn't work) Hey, wha-what's the matter with this thing? Hey-Hey Gnorme, can you come out here and give me a hand?"
3,31,Gnorme,Of course! (walks in and drops a cage on Parable)
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Do you like him, Parable the Dragonpus? I call him a Lawn Gnorme. He protects my garden from witches' spells and wood trolls. I'm going to make small versions of him and sell them all over... Anyway, let me tell you about my plan for seizing control of the Tri-Kingdom Area. (walks down the tower) You see, I was bullfrog hunting down by the rat catcher's shack and came across a... (muffled sound from going around the back of the stairs) ...the biggest raspberry I've ever seen! It was the size of a cucumber! (muffled sound) ...is what I said because I had a gag over my mouth. (muffled sound continues until he reached the bottom) ...and that's why I decided to take over the Tri-Kingdom Area! True story. And now, I know exactly how to do it! You see, I found this ancient text, more of a-- a pamphlet really, and decided to use it to conjure up the most evil multitude to ever tread the Earth! But to do that, I needed to start with the most hideous substance known to man: Canned meat! Tripe-Henge Brand, only the best! So, earlier today, I placed thousands of cans of canned meat into the largest of my three cauldrons, cast my evil reanimation spell, and ta-da! (Gnorme dumps them out of the cauldron, and the small meatlings begin chattering ""meat"") Yeah, don't say it, I know, they're—they're a little small, but that's why the rain, see? They absorb water, and they will grow, and when they get bigger, I'm hoping their attitude will become a little more, you know, rampage-y."
3,31,Phineas,"Isabel, why did you take us to the Inn of the Prancing Platypus?"
3,31,Isabel,"We need allies. There's a lot of mercenaries and thugs to choose from. Plus, they make a great taco salad."
3,31,Phineas,Who's that creepy guy? He's been staring at us since we got here. I wonder what he wants...
3,31,Isabel,He's coming over! Be cool.
3,31,Bufavulous,"I would recommend a little more caution from you, wizardling. Malifishmirtz's spies are everywhere. Look at that guy over there."
3,31,Phineas,He doesn't look like a spy; he looks more like a shepherd.
3,31,Bufavulous,He's a shepherd spy. They're the worst kind.
3,31,Phineas,Are you a mercenary thug?
3,31,Bufavulous,"Actually I'm here for the taco salad. But you guys look like you could do with a little muscle. The name's Bufavulous, the Wind Lord. I can help you on your quest."
3,31,Phineas,Welcome aboard!
3,31,Bufavulous,"You should also know that I travel with a companion by the name of Baljeetolas, of the Nerdling Realm."
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Greetings, adventurers! If by my bow, or my vast store of useless knowledge I may aid you... Hey, where is my bow?"
3,31,Bufavulous,You left it in the booth.
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Oh, excuse me. Well, there it is. Has anyone seen my arrows?"
3,31,Bufavulous,Bathroom!
3,31,Isabel,"Now that we're all congregated, we must away!"
3,31,Bufavulous,"Let everyone now task his thought, that this fair quest may on foot be brought!"
3,31,Monogram,"Whoa, hey, whoa, hold it. What's with the banjo?"
3,31,Carl,Traveling music.
3,31,Monogram,"Where are they going, Alabama?"
3,31,Carl,"What do you mean, sir?"
3,31,Monogram,"Well, uh, questing music should have an element of foreboding and mystery, you know, lots of minor chords and stuff. And, to make it sound more medieval, you throw a major chord in right at the end."
3,31,Carl,"(sighs) Okay, I'll see what I can do. And so, the merry band set off on their quest, to the foreboding sounds of minor chords. Better?"
3,31,Monogram,Little less sarcasm would be nice.
3,31,(Song,"""Questing Song"")"
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"What do you know, my shepherd spy tells me that a team of erstwhile heroes bent on defeating me are on their way here right now."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Oh, yeah, sure. It's just down that way, past the Sally-port on your right. You can't miss it!"
3,31,Phineas,A bridge.
3,31,Baljeetolas,Are not these kind of things guarded in these types of stories?
3,31,Bufavulous,"Yeah, like by a troll?"
3,31,Troll,(Appears in a puff of smoke) Do I look like a troll to you?
3,31,Baljeetolas,Do not answer truthfully; it will only enrage her.
3,31,Troll,"In order to cross my Bridge of Comprehension, you must first answer three questions. The questions will fall into three categories: arts and sciences, social studies, and what's hot and what's not."
3,31,Baljeetolas,"(Standing beneath the bridge in the creek bed) Uh, hey guys? It is not really that deep down here."
3,31,Troll,The answer must be given in haiku form.
3,31,Phineas,"If it's all the same to you, we'll just go around."
3,31,Troll,It's not all the same to me.
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Just for the record,"
3,31,Troll,"Come back! You can't ju... Wait a minute! Just-for-the-rec-ord The-an-swer-to-your-rid-dle is-an-egg-bye-now. Hum, what do you know, that was a haiku."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"The time has come, my little meat gamejos. Rain down on my enemies, and stop them from advancing. And bring me back a newspaper. (Malifishmirtz fires them from a catapult and cackles) You too. Go. (He flings one more meatling)"
3,31,Phineas,Uh oh. Doesn't look good. (In reference to the giant gorge they are overlooking) Whoa.
3,31,Bufavulous,This is where that crazy old bat should have built her bridge.
3,31,Isabel,"This is the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore."
3,31,Baljeetolas,Why must everything have such long names?
3,31,Phineas,We're going to have to turn around and find another way across this gorge.
3,31,Bufavulous,"Oh no, canned meat! Now we're in trouble."
3,31,Isabel,But they're so cute.
3,31,Phineas,They're getting bigger!
3,31,Bufavulous,And more rampagey!
3,31,Baljeetolas,Are quests usually this short?
3,31,Phineas,We're not going to go without a fight!
3,31,Isabel,Phineas! I want all of you to jump.
3,31,Phineas,"Uh, you know that it's called the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore for a reason, right?"
3,31,Isabel,"I have a plan, just trust me!"
3,31,Phineas,"I don't know, how 'bout you Ferb? (Ferbalot jumps off the cliff) Should we... Ferb? He's right. Come on! (He jumps as well)"
3,31,Bufavulous,"Mother always told me that if all the other kids were jumping off a cliff, I should, too."
3,31,Baljeetolas,Your mother said that?
3,31,Bufovulous,She was not a nurturer. Let's go!
3,31,Phineas,"Isabel, if you're going to do something, now would be a nice time! (The screen freezes with the four of them all in midair)"
3,31,Major Monogram,"Carl, you- you stopped!"
3,31,Carl,I think we need to take a little break.
3,31,Major Monogram,"Wow, bad time for that. You totally left me hanging in that cliff scene."
3,31,Carl,"That's kinda the point, sir."
3,31,Major Monogram,"Oh, I see. Very clever."
3,31,Carl,"Sorry sir. I was just down in your beautiful kitchen and your wife was making two sandwiches. And I got to tell you, they were de-lish!"
3,31,Major Monogram,Did she make one for me?
3,31,Carl,Oh...huh. How about we get back to the book?
3,31,Major Monogram,"Carl, did you eat my sandwich?"
3,31,Carl,"As our heroes fell, doubt swept through them-"
3,31,Major Monogram,"Carl, you ate my sandwich!"
3,31,Carl,"Do you want to hear this or not, sir?"
3,31,Major Monogram,Okay.
3,31,Carl,"As our heroes fell, doubt swept through them."
3,31,Phineas,"Isabel! If you're going to do something, now would be a nice time!"
3,31,Isabel,"Sisters! Hear my summons, beckon through the rain, carry thy waters to me now, and fill the river once again."
3,31,Isabel,"Nice work, girls! See you at Tuesday's brunch."
3,31,Phineas,That was cool; a slide made out of water!
3,31,Bufavulous,What would you call a thing like that?
3,31,Baljeetolas,I don't know.
3,31,Troll,"Oh good, another customer for my bridge. In order to cross my Bridge of (She turns around and opens her eyes as a shadow falls over her) Com... Com... Com..."
3,31,Candavere (in a strange voice),Have you seen my brothers?
3,31,Troll,"(Points in the direction Phineas and Ferbalot went) Com... Com... Com... Cooooom...prehension. Well, I think that went well."
3,31,Isabel,We're getting close. This must be the Swamp of Spit-Poor Attitudes!
3,31,Phineas,Why is it called that?
3,31,Isabel,"Legend has it, that in order to get across this swampy marsh, you have to have a good attitude."
3,31,Phineas,"This swamp was made for me! Come on, Ferbalot!"
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Come on Bufavulous, what is the holdup?"
3,31,Bufavulous,I ain't goin'.

3,31,Bufavulous,"You don't know me very well, do you?"
3,31,Phineas,"Hey guys, I can see Mount Doof from here, we're almost there!"
3,31,Baljeetolas,"I have an idea. I think I have a way to get you across this swamp. I have been working on a way of solving problems by the process of deriving reliable generalizations from observation. I call it ""logic."""
3,31,Bufavulous,Logic? How come I've never heard of this?
3,31,Baljeetolas,Because it is the Middle Ages.
3,31,Bufavulous,"Oh, is it anything like hysterical hearsay?"
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Yes, in that it is the exact opposite of that."
3,31,Bufavulous,Yeah?
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Listen, here is how it works. By observing the swamp, logic tells me that it is too big to go around. And by gathering information about it from Isabel, I can logically make assessments about the best way to get across. Are you following me?"
3,31,Bufavulous,Absolutely not.
3,31,Baljeetolas,(He sighs) Phineas has pie.
3,31,Bufavulous,"Out of my way, runt! (He runs across the swamp)"
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"And that's why the Earth is flat, Parable the Drogonpus. Huh, what's this?"
3,31,Mirror,Thou hast mail!
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Mail? Who's it from, let me see? Ooh, a video! (Pulls up a video of the five heroes) Look at that. I don't believe it! How did these miscreants escape my meatlings?"
3,31,Isabel,"Behold, the Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters! Here you will find the sword Excaliferb."
3,31,Phineas,"Cool! Looks like you're on, bro."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Let's see how they deal with this! (He throws a puff of smoke at the mirror, which causes a large pile of rocks to come tumbling down at the kids)"
3,31,Phineas,"Uh-oh! Avalanche! Quick, inside! (They all run inside just before the rocks block the entrance)"
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"That should do it. (Parable chatters) Now where were we, Parable the Dragonpu- (Parable kicks Malifishmirtz in the face) Hey! How did you escape from-- (The cage is seen, burnt through) Oh, right, fire-breathing dragon, wicker cage... What do you know, that guy at the pet shop was right. (Parable launches himself at Malifishmirtz, but is knocked towards the window and tries to prevent himself from falling) Ah-HA!! (Parable gets shot by Malifishmirtz's staff and falls out the window) Man, this thing really does work when you put batteries in it."
3,31,Lady of the Puddle,"Ferbalot... (He wakes up) The object you seek is near. Come this way. (Ferbalot is led towards a glowing blue light) Behold! The sword Excaliferb! (The sword is sticking out of a stone with a sign reading ""One Yanketh Per Customer"") The instrument that will be Malifishmirtz's end."
3,31,Phineas,"(walking into the Excaliferb room with the rest of the heroes) Wow. Look! Ferbalot is modeling this season's latest in magical weaponry, Excaliferb. But, wasn't there something we had to do first?"
3,31,Phineas,"Oh, right. The Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"(laughs evilly) Finally, my greatest nemesis vanquished! Now, Parable the Dragonpus, prepare to meet your dim. Doom! I mean Doom. Prepare to meet your... Uh, man, talk about blowing the moment."
3,31,Ferbalot,"Behold, evil wizard Malifishmirtz. (draws sword) I hold the sword Excaliferb. This mystical vorpal blade was given to me by the Lady of the Puddle. Get a good look at it, for it is the instrument of your demise! (The blade of the sword falls off the hilt) Well, uh, okay. So big deal, the end's come off."
3,31,Phineas,Looks like we're switching to plan B everyone.
3,31,Bufavulous,Plan B?
3,31,Baljeetolas,"Yes, that is where we all attack him with ten thousand monsters."
3,31,Bufavulous,"Oh, that plan B."
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Are you kidding me?! I'm not afraid of you kids or your monsters. In fact, I am not afraid of anything! Ha! Except, you know, unicorns, but other than that, nothing! Just unicorns and... and whales. That's... That's a given, everyone's afraid of whales. And squid. Uh, Unicorns, whales, and squid, and... and Pegasuses. That's it! Pegasuses, whales, unicorns, squid, scorpions, barnacles—You know, I should really make a list. And girls. I used to be terrified of girls but I sort of got over that. (The genetically twisted Candavere appears behind him) Now it's just, you know, like, sort of a mild anxiety. So just to recap: girls, whales, squid-- (Notices that everyone is looking towards the sky) Hey, what's everyone looking at?"
3,31,Candavere,"Phineas and Ferb-a-Lot, you are so busted!"
3,31,Malifishmirtz,"Oh, what do you know, it's a uni-whale-scorpio-Pega-squid-icorn- girl. What are the odds. You know, taken all together, it's more ridiculous than scary. I guess it doesn't have a cumulative effect."

3,31,Carl,"Fine. Suddenly they all found out a way to settle their differences, and it wasn't long before a peace accord was drafted and signed."

3,31,Monogram,"(Reading) Hmm, both contracting parties, undertake to maintain peaceful and friendly relations between them, in the mutual ib- Oh! Come on Carl! Whatever happened to Candavere, what about Jeremiad?"
3,31,Carl,"Well, I suppose I could just skip to the epilogue, sir. Hmm. Having signed the peace accord, the happy wanderers returned to their village as heroes. The rain stopped, and Candavere kept her date with Jeremiad. As they danced, she was as happy as a young girl could be. Especially as she was now back to normal. (Candavere spits out fire) Well, almost. But even as the heroes recalled their tales of glory, the evil Malifishmirtz slipped away, bent on laying the groundwork for a sequel. (Malifishmirtz escapes from his pillory) But for now, all was right with the world, and everyone in the village agreed that it was the best Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire's Eve ever. Certainly the first one to have ten thousand monsters. The End. How was that, sir?"
3,31,Monogram,"Okay, I guess."
3,31,Carl,"Well, I guess I'd better get going."

Carl's off today, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to work this thing. Anyway, we have reason to believe Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. Again, since Carl is out, I'll have to do the visual reference myself. (clears throat; begins to draw on pieces on paper, showing his pictures to Agent P.) He's recently purchased a small tux, a silver tray, and a pair of white gloves. Heh heh, I traced my hand for that one. Ooh, check this out! (Monogram draws details of a turkey on the hand.)

You don't belong in that uniform! You belong in this hat! (Carl takes Agent P's fedora and puts it on Perry's head, who looks at it, confused.) See?"
3,35,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus! You have grape juice on your shirt. I can't have my manservant looking like a street urchin. You should go clean up before it sets.

3,35,Doofenshmirtz,"(As the Butler-inator takes measurements of Perry) When my Butler-inator is finished with you, not only will you have a perfectly-tailored uniform and wig, but you'll actually think you are my butler! You won't even remember that you fight evil for a living!"

""Thait I live""? What's that, some new band? (Perry grabs a mirror and Doofenshmirtz gasps.) Oh, ""I fight evil""! Very clever. You wrote a note to yourself in the future.

3,21,Candace,Obviously my relationship with Jeremy depends on it! So you'll help me?
3,21,Eliza,"Yeah, alright."
3,21,Adrian,Hah! I've given you a sound thrashing I have!
3,21,Lawrence,"Yes, yes, you always did have more wind than I."
3,21,Lucy,That's my Adrian. So talented.
3,21,Linda,I don't know if I would be bragging about holding my breath for 13 seconds. (Chuckles)
3,21,Lucy,"Well, at least Lawrence is always so gracious in defeat. Hors-d'oeuvres, anyone?"
3,21,Adrian,I'll bet I can make myself sick eating prawny puffs before you can.
3,21,Lawrence,Carnival ride sick or emergency room sick?
3,21,Speaker,"(Intro theme playing...) Sweaty Men Playing Games Network presents Football X-7. Theoretical speculative conjecture or not that what we just said, with the conjecture thing? Football. Sometimes called soccer, footy, association football or the beautiful game. But, in 1952 a British theoretical physicist, and football enthusiast Professor Ross Eforp, hoped to heighten the football experience by creating the most thrilling and challenging version of soccer imaginable, which still allowed the players to survive. He called it Football X-7. He proposed building an immense gyroscopic, gravity-low stadium, creating an omnidirectional pitch allowing teams to play in 3 dimensions. After several attempts to build a Football X-7 stadium ended in disaster, most scientists, engineers and defensive mid-fielders agreed that Professor Ross Eforp's ultimate football game could never become a reality. The final blow came when it was discovered that Professor Ross Eforp's name is the same spelled forwards as it was backwards, and in the highly-charged anti-palindrome atmosphere in the mid-1950s Professor Ross Eforp was forced into hiding. As for Football X-7, is it possible perhaps one day someone some young dreamer with remarkable building and creative skills might just make Professor Ross Eforp's dream come true? No, not a chance, don't be ridiculous it's impossible."
3,21,Phineas,Impossible?! The only thing's that is impossible is impossibility. Now Ferb and I believe we figured out where Professor Eforp went wrong.
3,21,Beckham (blond),Oi. Are you actually saying you're gonna build that here?
3,21,Phineas,"Yes. We are gonna do what no one has ever done before. Play the biggest, baddest, onliest game of Football X-7 ever! Now, who's with me?"
3,21,Isabella,"(as she, Buford, and Baljeet raise their hands) We are, of course."
3,21,Beckham (blond),"Completely mad, the lot of them."
3,21,Phineas,Let's get started. Come on Ferb. We need to—Ferb? Ferb? Ferb?
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,(Coughs) Perry the Platypus? What are you doing here? Did you get my mess—Is that chicken soup? (Perry gives him a look) What?
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that? Yeah I was planing to do evil today but look at me. I just don't think it's gonna happen."
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh man, 103? Seriously, if I was a hot tub people would be getting out of me. They'd be all like ""Wow, Heinz Doofenshmirtz is way too hot. We should get out of him."" Anyway, since you're here, I taped my rehearsal. I'll just play it for you. It'll be just as good. I shot this yesterday when I was feeling considerably better then."
3,21,Doofenshmirtz on TV,"Lalalalala. Topeka, Kansas. Topeka, Kansas. Okay. So, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering why I trapped you in this soundproof capsule? Wait, (Ugh) If it's soundproof he won't be able to hear me... Oh."
3,21,"(Doofenshmirtz pushes a button turning it into static. The screen goes back in a split second.) For generations philosophers have asked, ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" The answer, by the way obviously is ""Of course it does."" I mean, duh! Right? Philosophers. Get a job thinky-boy! Now see, the question they should be asking is, ""What sound does the falling tree make?"" Behold! The If-a-Tree-Fell-In-The-Forest-Inator! Dun dun dun! One blast from this puppy will knock over a tree or anything else for that matter-and the sound it will make is","(Whisper) Doofenshmirtz... (Normal) I, will have eternal fame as the answer to that one philosophical question! I'm also working on a Sound-of-One-Hand-Clapping-Inator. Doo-Fen-Shmirtz. I'll CORNER the markets! And speaking of markets, I'm out of vitamins. I should really get some before they close... Eh. So I skipped my Vitamin C for a day. What's the worst thing that could happen?"
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Not one word, Perry the Platypus. You have to at least give me a chance to do my thing, okay? Good. Okay, here we go. Where is it? Here we go. (Deploys the trap on the other side of the room, nowhere near Perry) There. I trapped you."
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, so what's next? I...activate my -inator, okay. Give me a head start here. (Groaning, stands up and cracks his back.) I'll get there, don't worry!"
3,21,Candace,"Oh, man. That thing is gonna be huge! I'm gonna go get my mom!"
3,21,Eliza,"Erm, Candace, you do know that tattling is not very ladylike."
3,21,Candace,It's not?
3,21,Eliza,"Afraid not, no. I've five little brothers myself, so you can imagine the discipline it takes."
3,21,Candace,No busting?!
3,21,Eliza,You asked me to teach you how to be proper and sophisticated for Jeremy.
3,21,Candace,"But- but...(Groans, then takes a deep breath.) Right. I can do this."
3,21,Eliza,"Good girl. The first lesson for a lady-in-training is about posture. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why this is, but from birth, all proper ladies are warned that they must stand and sit completely vertically straight, and even the tiniest bend or deviation on one side will lead directly to a life of horror and destitution."

3,21,Beckham (half-moon glasses),Whoa! That's brilliant! I'm totally gobsmacked!
3,21,Phineas,"Yeah, I guess I could smack a little gob myself."
3,21,Beckham (blond),Now it all comes down to the game. Are you ready?
3,21,Phineas,"Well, yeah! How about you, Ferb?"
3,21,Phineas,Oh no! I was afraid something like this would happen.
3,21,Isabella,What will we do?
3,21,Phineas,(At the camera) We'll be right back.
3,21,Phineas,"(voiceover) Ferb's soccer problem started a few months ago, right before summer began. Um, actually, that's a little early in the day."
3,21,Phineas,"(voiceover) Okay, closer. A little later than that."
3,21,Phineas,"(voiceover) Whoa, what is that, night? Back it up to about the middle of the third quarter..."
3,21,Phineas,(voiceover) Like there! Right there. Thank you. So anyway...

3,21,Phineas,"(voiceover) We were having a great game. Ferb, as always, was in top form. Little did I know it would be Ferb's last game. Late in the second period, the other team had kicked the ball out-of-bounds, and Ferb grabbed it. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a herd of emu ran onto the field and carried off our assistant coach. Ferb simply put the ball down and walked off the field. That was it. Ferb hasn't played football since."
3,21,Beckham (half-moon glasses),"I don't blame him, poor fellow. It's the Emu Curse."
3,21,Phineas,The Emu Curse?
3,21,Beckham (half-moon glasses),"It goes like this: if you're holding the ball, and a herd of emus carries off your assistant coach, then you're cursed to never be on a winning team again."
3,21,Phineas,Wow. British curses are really specific.
3,21,Isabella,"Well, no wonder he disappeared."
3,21,Phineas,We're gonna have to break that curse!
3,21,Beckham (blond),"Good luck, mate."
3,21,Beckham (half-moon glasses),"To break the Emu Curse, a boy wearing a Sunday bonnet must sing the note Eb above high C in front of the cursed one."
3,21,Phineas,"Eb above high C? Whoa! Wait a second, who's got a piccolo? Buford?"
3,21,Buford,"Argh! One day somebody's gonna ask me for some obscure musical instrument, and it ain't gonna be there. What's gonna happen then? (Pulls out the piccolo and plays the Eb above high C)"
3,21,Doofenshmirtz,"What is that ringing so- is that Eb above high C? Oh, for crying out loud, Perry the Platypus, really? Really? You're thwarting the ill...? (Begins hacking up a lung)"
3,21,Phineas,Here it is! The Football X-7 stadium! Complete with omnidirectional hover goals and observation deck/high tea room!
3,21,Beckham (blond),Wow...
3,21,Phineas,"It's designed so that the ground hugs your feet, making it possible to literally walk on walls! So the goals can be scored from any angle."
3,21,Beckham (blond),"Brilliant, let's play."
3,21,Phineas,I wish we could.
3,21,Isabella,Yeah. We don't have a team without Ferb.
3,21,Buford,Yeah. He was our quarterback.
3,21,Baljeet,"You still do not know what game we are playing, do you?"
3,21,Beckham (blond),You do realize without a full team you forfeit the match?
3,21,Phineas,"Don't worry, you guys. If I know my brother, he'll come through for us!"
3,21,Phineas,Ferb?
3,21,Irving,"Hi, guys! I brought some dry ice!"
3,21,Baljeet,Aww.

3,21,Jeremy,Whoa! Cool! What're they doin'?
3,21,Candace,"Some sort of silly game. As a lady, I'm not terribly interested in such foolishness. I'm much more interested in curtsying and other dainty pursuits."

3,21,Jeremy,Yeah. I can't say I've seen better posture.
3,21,Candace,Would you care to stack books on my head?

3,21,Candace,That sounds divine! Shall we?
3,21,Jeremy,Of...course!
3,21,Candace,Have you noticed my extended pinkies?
3,21,Jeremy,I was just about to comment on them. They're really up there.

3,6,Candace,"Well at least we'll all get wet. (the shark splashes down, only soaking Candace; she shouts to the sky) Really? Really?? (an octopus lands on Captain Squint's face)"
3,6,Captain Squint,Arr! It's the octopus that ate me pancreas!
3,6,Candace,(to the sky) Thank you.
3,6,Captain Squint,"Get back here, beast! (the shark sends the Pea-quad flying with a tail flick)"
3,6,"Candace, Stacy, Captain Squint",Whoa! (the Pea-quad skips across the sea)
3,6,Phineas,"Wow, six skips! (to Ferb) Nice going."
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Here we go. (rolls backwards off the stern but lands on a metal grate) Ow! Oh, okay, that hurt. All right, better just, uh... (prods the water with his spear gun) Okay, I'm good. (jumps off his boat and swims down to the Saltwater Taffy-inator; he pushes a button) Now I will activate my Saltwater Taffy-inator. (turns a handle; the -inator begins spinning taffy) At last! Now nothing can prevent me from promoting tooth decay! Ha-HA-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... (fogs up his scuba mask) Aw, I fogged up my mask again! (clears his mask to reveal Perry in a wetsuit swimming towards him; Perry punches him backwards) Perry the Platypus? How did you get out? (Perry flashes back to the crabs forming a ladder, but Doofenshmirtz grabs him from behind) Ha! I grabbed you while you were flashing back to your escape! Hee-hee-hee... drbt! (Perry kicks him and starts swimming away)"
3,6,"Candace, Stacy",Yikes!
3,6,Captain Squint,"(holding a fishing rod with the cheese hook) I've caught many a fish with this lure. (casts the hook at the shark, catching it) Take the pole and I'll man the wheel! (lets go of the rod, causing it to yank the two girls forward)"
3,6,"Candace, Stacy",Whoa!
3,6,Candace,"Come on, Stacy, pull!"
3,6,Captain Squint,"♪ She bought me coat and the mermaid brought my boots... ♪ HA-ha-ha-ha-ha!!! Tug on this, beast. (pulls a lever; the fishing line snaps, causing Candace and Stacy to fall back into the stern; Captain Squint wheels a cannon to the stern) Suppertime! (lights the cannon, causing a bolo made of rubber ducks to loop around the shark's tail) Bullseye!"
3,6,Candace,Rubber ducks? Are you serious?!?
3,6,Captain Squint,Does a penguin fly?
3,6,Candace,No.
3,6,Captain Squint,"Aw, now I'm tired of this conversation too! (leaves)"
3,6,Stacy,The ducks are back!
3,6,Captain Squint,(emerges from the head holding a plunger attached to a rope) I'll harpoon the beast!
3,6,Candace,That's a plunger.
3,6,Captain Squint,I didn't buy this ship for its plumbing!
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,Yahhh! Swim for your life! (the taffy engulfs Perry and Doofenshmirtz and starts spinning them around)
3,6,Captain Squint,"Come to Papa, beast. Well, I-I ain't really a papa; I-I never had kids of my own, see, and... if I did they probably wouldn't be... sharks, but... you know what I mean! (the shark emerges at the stern) Ohhh... ohh!!"
3,6,Stacy,"Candace, he reaches!"
3,6,Stacy,We're gonna need a bigger captain.
3,6,Phineas,Cheese and sausage?
3,6,Captain Squint,So this is what the inside of a shark looks like? I always thought it would be more... stomach-y.
3,6,Stacy,I think maybe it's time we just call it quits.
3,6,Candace,"(putting on Captain Squint's hat and wielding his harpoon) Stacy, I'm tired of this conversation!(lightning strikes behind them)"
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,"(trapped in the taffy) Ha-HA! I still have the upper hand! (the taffy spinner rotates, moving Perry above Doofenshmirtz) Well, actually you may at this particular mo... (the taffy squishes them together, then separates them again) Chew first, Perry the Plat... ahhh!!"
3,6,Candace,"Hoist the mainsail! (Stacy does so) Swab the poop deck! (Stacy does so) Watch that jib, sailor. (the jib knocks Stacy's hat off) Now take the helm! (puts Stacy at the wheel and rides a rope onto the bowsprit) I've got a date with destiny, and it ain't gonna end with a kiss! (spots the shark through a spyglass) You've vexed me for too long. Too long! Full speed ahead, Stacy; get me in close!"
3,6,Stacy,"Aye aye, Candace!"
3,6,Candace,Captain!
3,6,Stacy,"Captain! (aside) Yikes, what is it about that hat?"
3,6,Candace,"From Danville Harbor I stab at thee; for busting's sake I spit my last spit at thee! (spits onto the plunger's bell) Unh! (hurls the plunger at the shark's fin, where it sticks) Make for shore, Stacy! We've got him! (the ship turns for shore, hauling the shark with it)"
3,6,Phineas,"(looking through a window in the shark) Say, whoever's on that boat has the story wrong. They're supposed to drive us out to sea, not drag us into shore! Looks like we're gonna need a bigger shark. (pulls a handle, making the shark grow in size; the grown shark starts dragging the Pea-quad out to sea)"
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Now I wish I'd made that ""OFF"" button more accessible from the taffy itself. (sighs; he and Perry are completely trapped in the taffy) I wonder how this is affecting the surface water."
3,6,Candace,Is that the best you've got?
3,6,Stacy,(emerging from the head with a handful of plungers) I found more harpoons! And I'm gonna pretend these have never been used!
3,6,Candace,"Load the cannon! (Stacy loads all the plungers into the cannon) Stand clear! (Candace lights the cannon, which fires; however, a rope loops around Candace's ankle and pulls her off the ship)"
3,6,Stacy,(clicks her tongue) Yep.
3,6,Candace,(roped to the shark; screams and bangs on the shark) I know you be in there!
3,6,Captain Squint,"(banging on the inside wall with a large fishhook) I'm-a get this outta here, boys."
3,6,Phineas,"We need more power, Ferb! (Ferb lashes the shark's tail rapidly)"
3,6,Candace,"Hard to starboard, Stacy! (Stacy turns the wheel port, turning the ship and shark around) Okay, that's port, but whatever!"
3,6,Puppet man,Arr! Arr!
3,6,Lawrence,"You know, it's such a shame the reenactment can't be this exciting."
3,6,Captain Squint,"A-ha-ha-ha! Free at last! Thanks for me new leg, boys! (his leg fires a rocket engine and Captain Squint flies away)"
3,6,Candace,"Mom! Mom! Look, Mom!"
3,6,Candace,"Look, Mom! Look at the shark!"
3,6,Candace,Mom!!
3,6,Linda,"What? (removes her wet bonnet and two starfish covering her eyes) Oh, that? (sees Buford and Baljeet in their ""shark"" costume) They get cheesier every year."
3,6,Buford,ROAR!! (starts shaking Baljeet)
3,6,Baljeet,You cannot attack me; I am the tail!
3,6,Buford,(yanks up Baljeet by the tail) Shark wedgie!
3,6,Candace,(walks up to them) That's not what I meant! (takes her hat off)
3,6,Linda,"It never is, honey. (at the kids) Who wants blood pudding?"
3,6,"Phineas, Buford, Baljeet",Me!
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, this much I could've predicted, but I'm having a hard time explaining the giant metal shark. (sighs as the shark is pulled towards them by the taffy) Well, at least we'll go together, Perry the Platypus. (Perry ejects from his wetsuit through the scuba helmet and swims away) Oh sure, I reach out to you and then you use the emergency face plate ejector thing. (the shark crashes into Doofenshmirtz, the taffy, and the -inator, creating a cloud of bubbles)"
3,6,"(On the surface, a giant bubble pops",)
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Perry the Plat-"
3,6,(A second bubble rises and pops,)
3,6,Doofenshmirtz,-ypus!
3,7,Stacy,"(Walks out the sliding door) Hey Candace, what're you doing out here?"
3,7,Candace,"Hey Stacy. (Blows out fire) I've got a lot of things to do today, so I figured I'd bust Phineas and Ferb early. You know, just to get it off my plate."
3,7,Stacy,How long have you been out here?
3,7,Candace,Since last night.
3,7,Stacy,Yeah well... who are those guys?
3,7,Candace,I don't know... who are you guys?
3,7,Random Guy,I thought you were waiting in line for concert tickets.
3,7,Candace,This is my backyard!
3,7,Random Guy,"There's always some kind of concert going on back here, I just thou--"
3,7,Candace,Get out of my yard!
3,7,Random Guy,Not a morning person.
3,7,Stacy,"So, what's this big thing you wanted to do?"
3,7,Candace,"Well, remember when Jeremy made that romantic dinner for me?"
3,7,Stacy,"Candace, he microwaved you a pizza."
3,7,Candace,"Yeah, a pizza for two."
3,7,Stacy,"Ah, yes."
3,7,Candace,So I want to reciprocate and make him a romantic dinner.
3,7,Stacy,"Are you sure? Candace, I don't know a lot about cooking."
3,7,Candace,"Well, neither do I, but I figure we'll use what you know and what I know and between the two of us we can figure it out right?"
3,7,Stacy,"Hm, why not? Now where's the cooking room?"
3,7,Candace,"It's in the kitchen, that's where we keep all the cooking tools."
3,7,Phineas,Hey Candace! We're going to the moon!
3,7,Candace,"The moon? Wait a minute, why are you going to the moon? Kind of a step backwards considering you've already been to Mars."
3,7,Phineas,Do you remember that old nursery rhyme The Cat and the Fiddle?
3,7,Candace,Vaguely.
3,7,Phineas,"Apparently, there was a last verse that was lost to history, until Ferb and I found it in the Dead Sea. It's a little wet and salty, but I'll read it. ""Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon. Due to the moon’s low gravity, the moon jumping cows' milk produced the best tasting ice cream ever!"" That last verse didn't rhyme, so they left it out of most versions. Ferb and I are going to the moon to see if it's true!"
3,7,Candace,Don't you need some cows for that?
3,7,Phineas,We do indeed.
3,7,Cow Cup,"(moos) Cows, get on the ship."
3,7,Candace,"Okay, (Scoffs) that's the dumbest thing I --"
3,7,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, I'm going to count backwards from 10, and when I'm done, you better be down here so I can bust you! (The ramp starts retracting) 10...9...8..."
3,7,Baljeet,Oh! Let us get to our stations.
3,7,Candace,5...4...3...2...
3,7,Candace,...1.
3,7,Phineas,"(While floating) Hey, where's Perry?"
3,7,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. Our sources tell us that Doof is up to something. We need you to infiltrate Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc. and have a little look see. To make it easier for you to get in, we have one of our operatives installing Central Access Threshold, or, CAT door. So, let's get out there and, good luck!"
3,7,Carl,So now I'm an operative?
3,7,Major Monogram,"We're still not paying you, Carl."
3,7,Phineas,"Remember everyone, (The spaceship door opens) the moon's gravity is 83.3% less than Earth."
3,7,Buford,So what?
3,7,Phineas,So what? So let's bounce! (Jumps off the spaceship) Whee!
3,7,Baljeet,"(Hung upside down by Buford) No, No, Buford! Please do not drop me I-- (Buford lets go) Oh! Oooh, well this is not so bad."
3,7,Buford,Yeah? (Jumps off the spaceship) Give it a second.
3,7,Baljeet,Oh! How is it possible that you are heavier on the moon?
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus. (Pause) What? Oh yes, the green? (Chuckles) I can explain."
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"It started two days ago when I was watering my plants. I noticed a beautiful garden on my neighbor's balcony. Oooh, I got so jealous. So the guy at the store told me—among other things—that my plants wouldn't grow because I didn't have a green thumb. A-and I should stop bothering with these types of plant questions and that my mere presence in the store was destroying his plants. So I got a big bucket of green paint, and I poured it on myself. Then I was green everywhere, except strangely my thumbs, I think it was the way I was holding the bucket."
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Anyhoo, with another great idea, I created the Moisture Suck-Inator! See? See? I don't know why I built it here when I was going to use it on the balcony... That wasn't-- anyhoo, this device will suck all the moisture out of my neighbor's plants, which will turn them brown, and make my plants look greener by comparison. And I will finally have a green thumb! You know not actually—metaphorically! I’ll have a gre--"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,Oh! (Smacks his head) It's a metaphor! (Sighs) And I wasted all that money on green paint.
3,7,Phineas,"Okay, nice job everyone! Now the cows have a place to live."
3,7,Baljeet,But what will the cows eat?
3,7,Phineas,"Ah, not to worry. After scientists discovered the existence of frozen water on the moon, Ferb and I began shooting seeds up here. Then we shot up hundreds of these pocket warmers to melt the ice in the ground."
3,7,Baljeet,"But Phineas, there's no oxygen here!"
3,7,Phineas,"That's alright, the grass will create its own oxygen through photosynthesis!"
3,7,Baljeet,"Yes, but you would still need so-- (Grass shoots up)—Oooh, or not."
3,7,Phineas,"We got our grass, Ferb. Let's get the herd fed."
3,7,Cow Cup,"(moos) Cows, lunchtime."
3,7,Candace,Oh. My gosh. Stacy. Your cooking hat looks so cute!
3,7,Stacy,Yours too!
3,7,Irving,(From outside) Mission control to Moon Farm.
3,7,Candace,What's that?
3,7,Irving,Come in Moon Farm.
3,7,Phineas,"(Through radio) This is Moon Farm, come back."
3,7,Irving,"Oh, this is mission control. Your transmission's a little garbled, but still understandable, over!"
3,7,Candace,Hey! (Marches over) What do you think you're doing?
3,7,Phineas,Is that Candace?
3,7,Irving,"Yes, she was just about to--"
3,7,Candace,"Just give me that! (Snatches the microphone) Phineas, you are so busted!"
3,7,Phineas,"Oh, hi, Candace. How's the cooking for Jeremy going?"
3,7,Stacy,Hey ask him what we should cook!
3,7,Phineas,"Roger that, Stacy. Ferb suggests lamb cobbler on account of Jeremy's British background."
3,7,Candace,We don't have that recipe.
3,7,Phineas,"That's okay, Ferb knows it by heart! You and Stacy go in the kitchen and we'll relay the recipe step by step through mission control."
3,7,Candace,Alright. But I'm still busting you! I'm still busting them.
3,7,Phineas,"Ferb says the first thing you'll need is a big bowl, over."
3,7,Irving,"Roger, mission control out. (Pause) A big bow? Hm, well I guess that'll make it look pretty."
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"(Groans) I got it. Man, why didn't I put wheels on this thing?"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"There. (Cracks back) I'll just aim it... there perfect. Now, you will witness the dehydrating effects of my Moisture-Suck-Inator on my neighbor's garden! And (Steps on switch) Fire!"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that doesn't seem to be working. Let me try it on something else. Hmm... (Drags the Moisture-Suck-Inator to Perry)"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"This is going to hurt you more than it'll hurt me, Perry the Platypus. Fire!"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs) Oh look at you, you're Pruny the Dehydra-pus. (Pause) Hm."
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,I wonder why it didn't do that to the neighbor's plants. Maybe it's too far away- maybe- argh. (Grinding noise) I gotta try it again. I'm not going to let that guy make me look like a nincomp--
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,--Oh poop. (Green beam hits him)
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,I'm going to go get a glass of water. (Pause) You want one Perry the Platypus?
3,7,Stacy,"This doesn't seem right Candace. I mean, four eggs bleated, a big bow, one pound of lamp—I mean that's not even food."
3,7,Candace,"Trust me Stacy, as annoying as Phineas and Ferb are, they're usually right."
3,7,Irving,Phineas and Ferb say—
3,7,Candace,Nu- Not in the house (Footsteps)
3,7,Irving,"Phineas and Ferb say, three cups of self-righteous flowers."
3,7,Stacy,You see? That's what I'm talking about; self-righteous flowers? What are self-righteous flowers?
3,7,Candace,Well roses always seemed stuck up to me.
3,7,Stacy,"(Pause) Okay, so let's go pick some roses."
3,7,Buford,Moon!
3,7,Cow,(Moos)
3,7,Buford,"Moo-na. Two syllables cow, two. Moo-na."
3,7,Cow,(moos)
3,7,Buford,"Man, these cows are dumb."
3,7,(Scene switch,Doofenshmirtz Evil Inc.)
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, that's much better. I was parched, how about you? We should do this more often, this was nice. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to jet-pack over to my neighbor's balcony and see what's going on with those plants. (jet-pack spurts fire, burning clothes) Right after I change my pants."
3,7,(Scene switch,Candace and Stacy)
3,7,Stacy,"So what's next, Irving?"
3,7,Irving,"Phineas and Ferb say, bake at 350 for one hour. Serves two. Speaking of serves two, I was thinking of, you know, after you girls are done here maybe we could-- (Door closes on him)—Okay, that's golden, we'll just put a pin in it for now."
3,7,Candace,"Stacy, what are we going to do? Jeremy will be here in five minutes!"
3,7,Stacy,"Relax Candace, it's simple math. Instead of 350 for one hour, we'll just cook this for five minutes at... (punches buttons on a calculator) ...9000 degrees. (Pause) What could go wrong?"
3,7,(Scene switch,moon.)
3,7,Phineas,"Okay everyone, ice cream's ready. Let's dig in. (Licks ice cream) Mmm. This is the best ice cream I've ever had!"
3,7,(Song,Moon Farm)
3,7,Baljeet,Hey! What do you mean you blame Baljeet?
3,7,Male Voice,"Well, it was clearly your responsibility."
3,7,Baljeet,"Where are you getting your information from, disembodied reggae space voice?"
3,7,Male Voice,"Hey, I have a name you know."
3,7,Baljeet,Oh yeah? What is it?
3,7,Male Voice,"Well, it's disembodied reggae space voice, but that's just a coincidence; you didn't know that!"
3,7,Baljeet,"Oh, look who's sensitive! Besides, Buford could have brought the marshmallows."
3,7,Buford,"Hey, leave me out of this!"
3,7,Phineas,"Guys, guys, we have limited time here! Baljeet, could you please stop arguing with the soundtrack?"
3,7,Baljeet,He started it.
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey you, I got a question for you. How do you get your plants—What? Plastic! (pokes plastic man)"
3,7,Man,"Something I can help you with, rocket man?"
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,Yeah! What's with all the plastic plants? And the plastic man?
3,7,Man,I like plastic.
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,Oh so you're just trying to make me look like a fool. Well I don't need you-- (accidentally turns on jet-pack) Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow! I’ll just take the stairs.
3,7,Candace,"I don't know Stacy, I got a bad feeling about this. What am I going to do if it isn't even edible?"
3,7,Stacy,"Well, technically it is English food."
3,7,Candace,"Well, here goes. (opens pot, gasps) Lamb cobbler! And it's beautiful!"
3,7,Stacy,How could that be? We didn't even put lamb in it.
3,7,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, what's going on out here?"
3,7,Phineas,"Hi Candace, we brought you some moon cow ice cream!"
3,7,Candace,"I don't care if you brought me ice cream from the moon. When Mom sees this spaceship in the yard, you two'll be soooo busted!"
3,7,Phineas,Huh. So how do you think our cows will do up on the moon?
3,7,Ferb,"Well, photosynthesis will start creating oxygen and eventually an atmosphere. Our bovine friends will be fine."
3,7,Phineas,Cool. We know where to go for ice cream.
3,7,Candace,"(Opening pot, gasps) It's all dried out!"
3,7,Jeremy,"Hey, everybody!"
3,7,Candace,Jeremy! I—uh—you're here!
3,7,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. It's really nice of you to make something for me. I can't wait to see what you've come up with."
3,7,Candace,Oh—uh—yeah...
3,7,Jeremy,I'll bet it's great.
3,7,Candace,Um... here's the thing. It's uh... I—I just don't know if you'll like it.
3,7,Jeremy,"Ooh, ice cream."
3,7,Candace,"What? (Phineas gives a thumbs up) Oh, yeah. Ice cream for two."
3,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh... Perry the Platypus? (Chuckles nervously) Yeah, I'm over here. Yeah I uh... I forgot my keys so I thought I— you know, just fit through the uh... (Perry opens door) Oh good, you're going to go get (Perry hangs a ""do not disturb sign"" on him) Wait, what's that? That better not be a ""Do not disturb"" sign. CURSE YOU, PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!"
3,7,Phineas,This is the best ice cream I've ever had!

3,20,Announcer,"Your parents played it, but now you can too!"
3,20,Candace,"Skiddley Whiifers is the best game ever! And HA! (Rolls a double 5) That brings me out of the mud pit, into the car wash, through the terrible tower, and uh oh, Roll Again! Yes! Double kings, baby! Excuse me. Here comes the big finish. Bing! Bing! Bing! Victory bell! I've broken the winning streak. (Slaps her own rear end) Oh, that feels good! You wouldn't know about that because YOU lost! I am the Queen of Skiddley Whiffers! Who is the queen? I am the Queen!"
3,20,Phineas,It sure is nice to see Candace happy.
3,20,Candace,"I mean, seriously, we've been playing this game for what, six years? And look, I've won 19 out of 24 games this year. The last 12, in a row, it's like Skiddley Whiffers wants me to win. Consequently, you two lose! [hits bell] Over, and over, and over again. Skiddley Whiffers is too easy! I need to move on to a bigger challenge. (leaves)"
3,20,Phineas,"A bigger challenge? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry?"
3,20,Major Monogram,"Happy nine hundredth and ninety ninth lair entrance, Agent P! To commemorate this joyous occasion, we like to present you with this souvenir t-shirt."
3,20,Carl,I made it myself! (gasp) I'm gonna go print up some more! Yay! Hmhm! (leaves)
3,20,Major Monogram,"Just wear it for the day, it's good for his self-esteem. (reveals he is also wearing the shirt) Uh, Doofenshmirtz has been spotted en route to Danville National Park. So, I guess for you it'll be a walk in the park. Haha, 'cause you're going to the park. Where Doof is."
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright everyone, we're here. Let's unpack so we can get a head start."
3,20,Vanessa,"""We""? Shouldn't you be off playing with your little platypus friend?"
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,What? And -- and leave my little girl all alone in the wilderness? No way!
3,20,Vanessa,"Dad, I'm not your little girl anymore. Look at me, I'm sixteen years old! Sixteen!"
3,20,Young Vanessa,"That's practically an adult! But, you still treat me like I'm a little kid!"
3,20,Vanessa,"(sigh) I just need some space, that's all. Ar -- are you even listening to me?!"
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"But Vanessa, what if there were a blizzard or an earthquake and -- and be with no one to take care of, not even kindly ocelots, like I had."
3,20,Vanessa,Dad!?!
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, I - I could be at that campsite right over --"
3,20,Vanessa,Go home!
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, pumpkin. Stay safe. But what if --"
3,20,Vanessa,GO!
3,20,Phineas,We suppose you're wondering why I called all of you here today.
3,20,Buford,"Yeah, actually, we were."
3,20,Phineas,"(closes eyes and extends arm, similar to Candace) Ferb?"
3,20,Phineas,Ta-da!

3,20,Candace,"(runs out) Alright! Nobody move! You two! You think you can just make giant...thingys for all the world to see? Well, no, sir! I'm gonna put the bust on you, but good. (runs off) Mom! Mom! Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making some giant --"
3,20,Phineas,(over) So in this giant version of the classic game Skiddley Whiffers...

3,20,Phineas,"Our gameboard today will be Danville itself, where rich architectural heritage and natural wonders will provide the thrills. And the first player back home wins. And we don't even have to do any work; just roll a number on this electronic die and the game pieces will automatically move that many spaces across Danville."
3,20,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, let's get this party started! Lob it over! (she catches the die, ""6"" appears on it) Six! So long, losers. (her sneaker moves) One, two..."

3,20,Johnny,Uh...
3,20,Vanessa,"Uh, hey there, strange man I've never met. What brings you to our campsite? And how soon can you leave?"
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I was just passin' by, you know, communing with nature and all, like, you know us, us hippies do it, a-and I thought, you dudes might wanna few groovy pointers from an old pro."
3,20,Vanessa,"Actually, we're doing just fine."
3,20,All but Vanessa,Hey!/Man!
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, fire is the leading cause of fire. Oh, woah. Is that a Puttmaster 3000? (runs up to Lacie's tent) I love these babies, they're -- they're so far out. They almost never collapse and...suffocate you while you sleep. But you know, (pulls out a book) Tri-State Almanac says, they should be at least twenty feet from running water, (measures the distance of Lacie's tent and the water) and yours is an inch too close, maaaan."
3,20,Lacie,Seriously?
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, and-and you need to tie up your food or you're gonna attract bears, (puts all the food in a bag and throws it on a rope onto a tree branch, making the picnic table hang) which would make it extremely difficult to, hang loose and, be groovy. I've got lots of other righteous camping tips, but first, I need to get some life vests out of my van."
3,20,Johnny,"Woah, that guy was totally freakstyle."
3,20,Vanessa,You have no idea.
3,20,Phineas,"Yeah! (catches die, it says ""5"") My third favorite number!"

3,20,Buford,Awesome!
3,20,Phineas,"But, what's with the monocle?"
3,20,Buford,"It's an affectation, leave it alone."
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Let's see, bandages, bug spray, shoulder pads, (Perry arrives via helicopter) and -- oh, hey man, nice threads. Sorry, no scheme today, I'm just secretly overprotecting my daughter while she's camping with some friends. It's dangerous out here, Perry the Platypus, and I should know. (He begins a flashback) You see, back in Gimmelshtump in my youth... WHen I was camping, I had an incident with a swarm of bees. I only got one sting, but it did a lot of damage. (Doofenshmirtz is seen falling off a cliff, through thorn bushes, and a fire hydrant field) I still have a hydrant stuck in my leg, see? I'd have it removed, but the doctors say it's too close to an artery to operate. (Perry stares at Doofenshmirtz) That kind of thing happens all the time in the woods! Alright, maybe I'm over reacting. Actually, it;s really just a beautiful pastural setting. There's probably nothing to--"
3,20,Candace,Whoo-Hoo! Sorry dude!
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,Huh? You see? You see how dangerous it is out here? You've got to help me over protect my daughter. Please? Please? Please? Oh great! I know just what you can do!

3,20,Vanessa,"Yes. Yes, he is."
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"You have to leave! It's not safe here for little kids, I mean for practically adults. Flee! Back to the city, away from danger!"

3,20,Doofenshmirtz,Like that!
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,See?
3,20,Vanessa,"All right, that's enough! Really Perry? Really?! I expect more from you. And you, Dad!"
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,But how did you...
3,20,Vanessa,"Oh please, you come out here jumping around with your costume, and your lame book, and it's... it's just humiliating, Dad. I'm not a little girl anymore."
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you're my little girl"
3,20,Vanessa,"I know, I know, but all I want to do is have a good time with my friends, and you just keep popping up. It's like you don't trust me."
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"(He sighs) You're right. I'm sorry I got in your way. I know you can handle yourself, Vanessa. (He walks away sadly with Perry) C'mon Perry the Platypus. Maybe there's still time for a scheme today. I won't even trap you. You can just start beating me up right away."
3,20,Johnny,Wait! I thought your dad was a pharmacist.
3,20,Doofenshmirtz,"(sighs) She's right, Perry the Platypus, I've been smothering her. You know, it's just so hard to let go, as a parent. But I'm going to turn over new leaf though, I can tell you that. No more worrying, no more disguises, (takes off hippie costume) no more rules! (tosses Tri-State Almanac over shoulder)"

3,34,Jeremy,"No, not weird, it's just-- (a customer walks up) Oh, wait, I got a customer, Candace. I'll - I'll call you later, okay?"
3,34,Candace,"(hangs up) He thinks it's weird. Why is it that when Phineas and Ferb have an idea, everyone's like (deep voice) ""Oh, wow, you guys are really clever!"" (normal voice) And when I come up with something, everyone goes ""What? Did you say something, Candace?"" (picks up the baklava bear, now covered with ants) Oh you know what I'm talking about, baklava bear. Ew! (after seeing the ants, she quickly throws the bear onto the ground)"
3,34,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Have you just seen a chicken wearing a baseball hat run by here?"
3,34,Candace,"No, why?"

3,34,Candace,Those aren't my ants! Do whatever you want with them. (goes inside the house)

3,34,Carl,"Again, sir, there was nothing on the box to indicate--"
3,34,Major Monogram,"Anyway, let's get this show on the road, shall we? (Carl hoists a cardboard replica of the screen and stops it with a rock) Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been collecting some extremely unusual items the last few days. Uh, some of the odd purchases include—Carl, where are my inserts?"
3,34,Carl,"Oh, sorry, sir. Do that last bit again."
3,34,Major Monogram,"(while he is speaking, Carl holds up images of each items) Some of the odd purchases include: biomolecular components simply used to make organic computers, a giant pilgrim hat, and most curious of all, a huge pair of food booties, used on the end of turkey legs for decoration. You know, Carl, I really like working live, it reminds me of my days in the theater group back at...The Academy."

3,34,Baljeet,"(sarcastically) Yes, I got it."
3,34,Phineas,Oh that was just a scale model to get the investors interested. This is the real thing.
3,34,Baljeet,Woah!
3,34,Isabella,How did we miss that?
3,34,Phineas,And right over there is Ferb's resize-nizer.
3,34,Baljeet,What does that do?
3,34,Phineas,"Well, you find an anthill and then, you add a scoop of it to the pot. Then, the ant Resize-inizer will rain enlarging fluid onto the dirt pile, and cause the ants to move towards the large synthostatic light, making them bigger. Then they continue to the Antius Maximus, the perfect place for the larger ants to live. In no time, we should have an ant farm filled with giant ants. Or Gi-ants."
3,34,Isabella,(she and Baljeet applaud) Nice one!
3,34,Baljeet,"Oh, Clever wordsmithing, good sir!"
3,34,Phineas,Thank you.
3,34,Buford,"Oh, fine. And I just get an eye-roll for Anti-Climaximus?"
3,34,Candace,"Oh, what the heck is that thing? (walks out) Oh, I'm gonna go tell Mom."
3,34,Phineas,"In order to move amongst the ants without upsetting them, we need to douse ourselves in ant pheromones. It's sort of like ant cologne, which will make them think that we're one of them. But not too much! We don't want them getting too friendly! (presses a yellow button)"
3,34,Buford,Bum bum bum...
3,34,Baljeet,"Stop it, Buford."
3,34,Buford,It smells like my grandma's house!
3,34,Isabella,Why does your grandmother's house smell like ant pheromone?
3,34,Buford,Have you met my grandma?
3,34,Isabella,Let's go see what the ants think of our new cologne.
3,34,Phineas,"You know what I like about our friends? We say things like ""We're gonna douse you with ant pheromones"" and they're just like ""Okay, whatever"". They're so cool!"
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,Ha! (opens the buckle door) Perry the Platypus?
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,"There's my guy. Why the Thanksgiving-themed trap, you may ask? You know how you get all and lethargic after you eat Thanksgiving dinner? Well, it's not because you're really full and, you know, slightly out of shape. It's because of all the tryptophan in the turkey. Now imagine, if the turkey were say the size of...a car or a building, there would be no resisting the tryptophanicle level of nature's little sleeping potion. That—is why—I created: the Turkey-inator! (pauses for dramatic effect) Wait, can you—can you see it from that little door, or do I have to move the hat, or—you're good? You're good. With this, I will fly over the city turning things into turkey all willy nilly, then—no one will be able to resist the all of that perfectly cooked turkey, goodness. And once the tryptophan cooks in, I'll take over the Tri-State Area with ease! Won't that be trypto-fun? Heeheehee. You know, ""tryptophan"", trypto...it's...you know, like...I'm wasting all this wordsmithing on a platypus."
3,34,Linda,"(offscreen) Candace, you know Wednesday is my Famous Statues Life Drawing class. (she is dressed as the Statue of Liberty) This had better be important..."
3,34,Candace,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb are building a huge glass and sand thing in the yard, it looks like a giant ant farm, but I don't know what it does!"
3,34,Linda,"Candace, please--"
3,34,Vivian,"(offscreen) Hold still, Linda!"
3,34,Linda,"(through teeth) Look, Candace, this is just gonna have to wait until I can take a break."
3,34,Candace,"But Mom, they're abusing their liberty! Don't you find that ironic?"
3,34,Linda,"Not enough to act upon right now, dear."
3,34,Candace,"(leaving) Okay, fine."
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,"So long, Perry the Platypus! Next time you see me, I will be the indisputable ruler of the Tri-State Area! (flies off on his inator) And when I say ""indisputable"", I mean totally disputable! Wait, no, no that doesn't work, I mean...uh-uh-putable! I-I mean puta—no. Eh, the moment's gone."
3,34,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, let me in! (pushes button; gets covered in ant pheromones) Ew! What the heck is wrong with this doorbell?! Hello? (pushes button again; gets covered in more pheromones) Ow! Oh, it got in my eyes! (pushes button once again; gets covered in more pheromones) Hellooooo?! (presses it three more times) Ugh, it tastes like Buford's grandmother's house! That is it! (goes inside Antius Maximus) When I lay my hands on them, aha! (while inside) Phineas and Ferb, you are soooo buuuu... (seeing giant ant) bu......bu...buggy? Yeah, uh, you know what? (chuckles) This is the wrong giant ant farm. I'm just gonna head out, okay? But being a job on the whole digging thing, really. Okay? (sees another ant) Oh, hello, yeah, take it easy."
3,34,(Song,"""Ants"")"
3,34,Candace,"(sees more ants) (chuckles) I-I guess I can stay for a little. Ha! No need to crowd, okay?!"
3,34,Phineas,Cool!
3,34,Phineas,"Hey, I wonder where they're going?"
3,34,Baljeet,Probably to see their queen.
3,34,Phineas,Good idea! Let's go see the queen! (seeing Candace in throne) Wow. Candace? You're queen?
3,34,Candace,"You know, you should really fix that doorbell. I must've pressed it like 10 times, and all it did was squirt sticky stuff on me."
3,34,Phineas,"The pheromones! Oh, that's why the ants think you're their queen! So, what's it like to have millions of ants at your beck and call?"
3,34,Candace,"Oh, it's great. Finally, someone understands my ideas. Only, they keep bringing me crumbs and grasshopper legs. I could really go for a salad. (an ant goes to make a salad) And you think, they'd have a fancy queen dress, or something. (another ant goes to make a dress)"
3,34,Phineas,"Hey, I wonder where are they going? (all but Candace exit)"
3,34,Candace,"Hey, get back here! What's the point of being queen if you're all alone?! (eating crumbs) Say, these bread crumbs aren't bad!"
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Time to start my Turkey Takeover! Commence random firing! (the Turkey-inator hits the following items: a passenger train that turns into turkey wings, a mailbox that turns into a turkey wing, which is eaten by two mail carriers, a cooked turkey, Perry's trap that turns into a turkey leg, in which Perry is led to escape) This is great! With Perry the Platypus out of the way, I can finish my sentences without getting punched in the-- (Perry punches him in the face mid-sentence)"
3,34,Phineas,Candace! You've gotta see what the ants are up to! I think you really made an impression on them.
3,34,Candace,"So, what'd they do?"
3,34,Phineas,"Well, you asked for a salad and a queen dress, so first, they evolved from a hunter-and-gatherer society, to an agrarian society. Look, they mastered farming in less than 10 minutes."
3,34,Baljeet,"Then, they put it all together to make you this salad. There are still grasshopper legs in it, but other than that, it is not bad."
3,34,Phineas,"Then, three minutes ago, they had an Industrial Revolution. Check it out! They're weaving the fabrics needed to make a dress for you!"
3,34,Isabella,"Wow, Candace, you're probably the most progressive Ant Queen ever!"
3,34,Candace,"This is so cool! I should call Jeremy and tell him. (looks at cell phone) Oh, there's no service in here. Nice. (at three of the ants) You there! Make there be cell service for your queen!"
3,34,Phineas,You think that's a good idea?
3,34,Candace,"Oh, like you'd never tamper with the delicately balanced, yet awesome power of nature."
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus, take that! And that! (gets head stuck in control board) Oh! Oh, man, that's disgusting! Still, it can't be the first time someone's got their head stuck in a turkey."
3,34,Candace,"Soooo, how are my subjects doing?"
3,34,Phineas,Shouldn't be long now. It looks like they entered the information age.
3,34,Baljeet,"They are really into online gaming now! Hey, who cast a sleep spell on me and stole all my gold? Ugh!"
3,34,Phineas,"Now that everything is automated, they have more time to devote for fun."
3,34,Candace,"Fun?! What about my cell service? Get back to work, you lazy ants! Your queen commands it!"
3,34,Phineas,"Huh, would you look at that? Apparently, they've advanced beyond the need for a monarchy!"
3,34,Ant,(bangs gavel) Motion carried.
3,34,Candace,"Fine! If I can't be queen, then it's busting time!"
3,34,Phineas,"Hey, guys. Why is it so quiet in here?"
3,34,Baljeet,The ants have left.
3,34,Isabella,They said something about needing to find themselves.
3,34,Phineas,"Oh, cool!"
3,34,Ant,"Greetings, Phineas. We have achieved total enlightment, and have transcended the need of maternal things, like ant farms."
3,34,Phineas,Wow! Good for you!
3,34,Ant,Our new colony will traverse the galaxy in search of the fabled Picnic Planet.
3,34,Phineas,Goodbye! Have a good time evolving past the need for physical existence!
3,34,Candace,"(dragging Linda into the backyard) As you'll see, the ants are the size of humans! (realizes it isn't there) Ta-da?"
3,34,Linda,"Oh, yes. I see. (at Phineas, Ferb, and their friends) Greetings, human-sized ants."
3,34,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
3,34,Candace,No! There were actually ants the size of people! (puts crown on head) See?! I was their queen!
3,34,Phineas,"Yeah, Mom. Candace inadvertently caused the ants to evolve."
3,34,Candace,"Exactly, and I was their queen!"
3,34,Linda,"Wow, Candace. Just like on Mars. (walks away waving)"
3,34,Candace,"I was—I -- Oh, forget it, I'm gonna go call Jeremy. (walks off, cell phone in hand)"
3,34,Phineas,(to Ferb) Do you think the ants will return some day?
3,34,Ferb,Yes. Probably while we're having a picnic.
3,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, be a dear and help a brother out. Can't seem to -- (Perry takes the control board off his head) Oh! Oh, thanks. (Turns around) No! What are you doing?!"

3,34,Phineas,Cool!

3,22,Linda,"Hey, boys. I'm just working on my junk sculpture for the Modern Installations by Moms charity auction."
3,22,Phineas,Cool! Seen Dad?
3,22,Linda,"Oh, he headed out for that speaking engagement of his."
3,22,Phineas,"Aw, we're gonna shoot darts and we thought he might want to play around."
3,22,Linda,Maybe next time.
3,22,Candace,What a racket! Those guys are so busted.
3,22,Linda,"Wow, I've really got a knack for this modern art stuff. I need to go get more materials! (drops the blowtorch; runs off)"
3,22,Candace,"So, mid-crime, huh?"
3,22,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
3,22,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Isabella! We're playing giant darts!"
3,22,Isabella,(flirtatiously) I bet you'll get a bulls-eye.
3,22,Phineas,(obliviously) Sure. Maybe not on the first try. It's all about little adjustments. And Buford and Baljeet are manning the target across town.
3,22,Baljeet,Tell me again how you are helping?
3,22,Buford,(lounging on a beach chair) I'm supervisin'!

3,22,Linda,"Hi, Isabella."
3,22,Isabella,"Hi, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher."
3,22,Phineas,"With our current velocity and wind resistance, we should be nearing the target in no time."
3,22,Phineas,Whoops! Better retract the launch mechanism.
3,22,Lawrence,"Let's see, where to. Ah, yes. 9019, Palindrome Road."
3,22,Lawrence,"Oh! That was close. (rights the car back up) Whoops! Dropped my address. (picks up the paper) Well, (places paper on the sun visor) 6106, Palindrome Road, here I come!"
3,22,Baljeet,Phineas and Ferb at ten o'clock!
3,22,Phineas,Oops. Outer ring. We'll try again.
3,22,Buford,"Zero. Write that down, Baljeet."
3,22,Baljeet,"Oh, yes, by all means, I do not want to forget to add zero later."
3,22,Phineas,"Hey, I meant to ask you earlier. Where's Perry?"
3,22,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. Our sources tell us that the members of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.,"
3,22,Candace,"(on her cell phone) Mom, you've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb made. I don't know what it is, but it looks horrible."
3,22,Linda,I'll be home right after I finish my errands.
3,22,Candace,But you gotta come home now before it disappears!
3,22,Linda,(imitating static) What's that? You're breaking up! (imitates static)
3,22,Candace,Wait! Mom! (growls) I hates when she does... (imitates static) ...but it doesn't matter. I'm not going anywhere.
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,(laughs) Right in there.
3,22,Candace,(gasps; stands up) That came from the front yard! (runs off) Phineas and Ferb!
3,22,Candace,A-ha! Huh?
3,22,Linda,Feathers. It needs feathers.
3,22,Candace,(gasps) Oh. My. Gosh.
3,22,Lawrence,"(stops his car) Well, this is the place."
3,22,Lawrence,"Yes, um, I'm supposed to be onstage?"
3,22,Man,"(puts paper down) They're about to get started. (pushes Lawrence towards stage) Go, go, go!"
3,22,(Song,Evil Tonight)
3,22,Rodney,"I am Rodney, and I am from the great state of South Dakota, home of beautiful Mt. Rushmore... For now!"
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"""I'm Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and I like unicorns and rainbows..."" Wait, who switched my..."
3,22,Rodney,(laughs)
3,22,Diminutive,I'm Dr. Diminutive and I don't have a Napoleon complex. Napoleon had a me complex! Don't cross me!
3,22,Diminutive,You can't do that!
3,22,Diminutive,Why?
3,22,Lawrence,"Excuse me, is this the way to the stage?"
3,22,Announcer,It looks like we have a late entry!
3,22,Baljeet,Phineas and Ferb at ten o'clock again!
3,22,Phineas,"Awesome! Triple ring, triple score!"
3,22,Buford,"Yeah, but in the one-point wedge. Three points, Baljeet."
3,22,Baljeet,When do I get to supervise?
3,22,Buford,Don't hold your breath.
3,22,Candace,"No one comes in, no one goes..."
3,22,Phineas,"(off screen) Okay, Ferb, let's reset and adjust both axes by five degrees."
3,22,Candace,(groans) I can't stand it! (runs off)
3,22,Candace,Ha!
3,22,Candace,(closes door) I'm gonna bust you yet!
3,22,Linda,Now to the butcher for the finishing touch.
3,22,Candace,What the...?
3,22,Announcer,"Welcome to the first annual L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Pageant of Evil,..."
3,22,Lawrence,(oblivious to what's going on) I thought I was already confirmed. Prepared my speech and everything.
3,22,Announcer,In addition to gaining total control of the iron...
3,22,Major Monogram,"(on wristwatch communicator) Agent P, it's come to our attention that Lawrence Fletcher, from your host family, has somehow entered the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Supreme Ruler Pageant."
3,22,Announcer,"Remember, points will be awarded by the audience,..."
3,22,Lawrence,"Wish me luck, boys. (at the mechanical mother) Hello, old dear, so lovely to see you. (bows) I've brought you some peonies. (pulls out a bouquet)"
3,22,Mechanical mother,"Oh, such a nice boy."
3,22,Rodney,I didn't think anyone could be more incompetent at being evil than you.
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,Me neither.
3,22,Announcer,"And now, he's serving her tea without a trace of irony!"
3,22,Lawrence,"(as he walks back) Remember to keep that foot elevated. (to the other two) What a lovely, old girl."
3,22,Rodney,Prepare yourself for a stunning display of filial beastliness. (walks away)
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, knock yourself out, Rodney."
3,22,Rodney,"(holding a present; at the mechanical mother) Hello, Mother. (kneels on one knee) I've brought you something special!"
3,22,Mechanical mother,For me? (opens present) You're such a good...
3,22,Announcer,Ooh! Dirty laundry!
3,22,Rodney,"(chuckles) Yeah. That's how it's done, boys."
3,22,Mechanical Mother,Oh! My baby still needs me!
3,22,Rodney,Huh?
3,22,Announcer,"Oh, no! Tears of joy? Zero points for that move!"
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, you monster. Watch and learn, Rodney. (clears throat; at mechanical mother) I am getting married again."
3,22,Announcer,"Audience, get your votes in, please."
3,22,Lawrence,"(at a smug Doofenshmirtz) I don't know how you did it! I don't even think I understood the event, but good show!"
3,22,Announcer,"And we're back with everyone's favorite, the swimwear competition! Here comes Lawrence Fletcher..."
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, I thought this was the talent competition! (skates off balance; falls head first into a toilet; muffled yelling) It won't stop flushing!"
3,22,Announcer,"(pause) And last is Rodney in his... (curtain opens) Oh, my gosh!"
3,22,Rodney,(growls)
3,22,Rodney,"(leaps out of tank; removes rubber mask) Technically, it is a swimsuit."
3,22,Candace,Meat? What possible functionality could that have?
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on, Rodney, the last event's about to... What? Wait, that's my Make-Everything-Evil-inator!"
3,22,Rodney,"No, Doofy, it's my Make-Everything-Evil-izer. It's an -Izer."
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"You're a jerk, you know that?"
3,22,Rodney,Yes! And I'm going to be more of one when I zap myself with this! (pulls on a lever) I'll be so evil there'll be no way I can lose!
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,(quickly sits on Rodney's lap) I'll zap me first!
3,22,Rodney,You broke my Izer!
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,Inator! Inator!
3,22,Rodney,Shut it!
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"No, you shut it!"
3,22,Lawrence,Have you seen these flashlights...AAH!
3,22,"Rodney, Doofenshmirtz",Uh-oh.
3,22,Delivery Man,"Excuse us. We're here to take, uh this... thing away."
3,22,Candace,(stands up from lawn) What? No!
3,22,Delivery Man,"Sorry, kid. We got a work order right here."
3,22,Candace,No! Nooooo!
3,22,Announcer,"And now the final event where each of our three contestants will attempt to intimidate the others with only the force of his evil glare. Contestants, take your marks."
3,22,Announcer,This could be a real opportunity for Doofenshmirtz!
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,Such evil!
3,22,Rodney,(shielding his face) Oh! My eyes!
3,22,Announcer,And the crowd is going wild! Fletcher's numbers are skyrocketing!
3,22,Major Monogram,"(on wristwatch communicator) Agent P, our sensors reveal that Lawrence Fletcher has been shot with a Make-Everything-Evil-izer. If he should become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., we will have no choice but to reassign you. You must find a way to snap him out of it. Remind him of his true, good nature. Remind him who he used to be!"
3,22,Phineas,"(off screen) This is the one, Bro. I can feel it."
3,22,Announcer,"I now present to you, the new supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., Lawrence Fletcher!"
3,22,Lawrence,"Today, Danville! Tomorrow, the world! (chuckling)"
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,"We have term limits in L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., right?"
3,22,Rodney,Nope!
3,22,Lawrence,(laughs evilly)
3,22,Phineas,Bull's-eye!
3,22,Phineas,I think that's Dad.
3,22,Ferb,What was the topic of his lecture again?
3,22,Phineas,"Hi, Dad!"
3,22,Lawrence,(taking off medal; flings it away) Phineas! Ferb! What are you doing here?
3,22,Lawrence,"(shaking Phineas's hand) Brilliant shot, by the way."
3,22,Phineas,"Aah, it's all about little adjustments."
3,22,"Doofenshmirtz, Rodney",Mine! Mine! Mine!
3,22,Rodney,It's mine!
3,22,Doofenshmirtz,Ooh! I hate you!
3,22,Phineas,"(as he, Ferb, and Lawrence walk away) So, how'd it go, Dad?"
3,22,Lawrence,"I'm not absolutely sure, boys, but I think I just became ""King of the Pharmacists""."
3,22,Phineas,"Awesome! (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry."
3,22,Candace,(grunts) No! Not until Mom has seen it.
3,22,Delivery Man,"Sorry, miss, I got a job to do."
3,22,Linda,Candace is right. Because it's not done yet.
3,22,Linda,"There. Take it away, guys. That junk sculpture should bring in big bids at the auction. (climbs down the flatbed)"
3,22,Candace,(in surprise) Junk sculpture?! (stuttering)
3,22,Linda,"Honestly, Candace, it's not like lip-synching is my only talent."
3,22,Candace,(continues stuttering)
3,22,Linda,"Well, now you're just being rude."
3,22,(Song,Evil Tonight)
3,22,Diminutive,"I don't have a Napoleon complex, Napoleon had a me complex! Don't cross me!"
3,22,Diminutive,You can't do that!
3,22,Diminutive,Why?
3,36,Linda,"Phineas? Ferb? Hey, boys. So, what's on the agenda for today?"
3,36,Phineas,We though we'd do something classic and take Perry for a walk in the park.
3,36,Linda,"He does need the exercise. Well, I'm heading to the store to pick up some things for dinner. I'm thinking spaghetti and meatballs, or a spaghetti-meatball. That's spaghetti and meat mixed up into a big ball. It's less of a choice of foodm than a choice of shape. Don't forget to bring a doodie bag for Perry! (leaves)"
3,36,Phineas,"We won't! (to Ferb) Hey, where is Perry?"
3,36,Phineas,"You know, Ferb, we should build a Perry. For occasions like this, when we're Perry-less. A giant anamatronic Perry with flashing eyes, fiberglass bill and... (Ferb holds up a blueprint of the Perrytronic 3000) Judo flipping tail action? Ferb, you anticipate my every need."
3,36,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P, and welcome to our new Evil Science Readiness Program. You just keep circling Doof's building, and the second Doofenshmirtz is ready to begin his scheme, you'll be there. It doesn't leave a lot of time for friends and family, but -- we feel the dramatic decrease in response time could well be worth it."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"What is he doing up there, just flying around in circles, uhh. It gives me the creeps! Well, it worked out in my favor anyway because, turn, close latch, I'm finally ready to begin my scheme!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha! You want to be a bird? Is that what you want? Well, this is what we do with birds, we put them in a cage. Can you speak, little birdy? Hello? Say, ""Hello, Perry want a cracker."" (Perry bites his finger) Ow! Bad bird! That would not have happened to me if I was smarter, which brings me to my new inator. The Duplicator-inator 2! You know what they say about two heads are better than one, right? Well, I will duplicate my head, and become twice as smart! And look, I even did some recycling by using my old microwave oven. (opens door) Baked potato? Eh, maybe later. (closes door) All my life I've been a zero, but when I have two heads, I'm gonna be twice that! You'll see!"
3,36,Phineas,"Too steely-eyed, Isabella! Less focus!"
3,36,Isabella,Whoops! (separates the eyes) How's this?
3,36,Phineas,Perfect!
3,36,Buford,"(oiling the feet) Sure, you get the fun part. If I wanted to oil feet, I could've stayed at home."
3,36,Baljeet,"(peeks out of the belly) When we are done with this, what will it do?"
3,36,Phineas,"Unlike a real platypus, which doesn't do much, the Perrytronic 3000's capabilities will be limitless!"
3,36,Candace,"KEEP IT UP! DON'T STOP, BUSY BEES! YOU'RE BUSY, BUSY, BEES!"
3,36,Stacy,What are you doing?
3,36,Candace,WORK! WORK! WORK! WORK!
3,36,Stacy,"All right, I'm out of here. You lost it. (starts to leave)"
3,36,Candace,"No, wait! (brings Stacy back) Okay? There is a madness to my method."
3,36,Stacy,You've got three seconds.
3,36,Candace,"Everything Phineas and Ferb build -- disappears when they're finished. So if I can keep them from finishing the thing they're building, it will never disappear! I call it Busy Bee Busting. B. B. Busting, for short."
3,36,Stacy,"You know what? I'll see you, La-La-Later. (leaves)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, let's try this. (fires the inator at his head and laughs) At last, I am --"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Don't just stand there, pick me up!"
3,36,Both,"Well, hello, handsome!"
3,36,Phineas,Looks like we're done!
3,36,Candace,"What? No! What are you talking about, ""done""?"
3,36,Phineas,"Well, the tail glaze is almost cool, so we just figured we'd test her out and then close the book on this one."
3,36,Candace,"Test, yes. Close book, no!"
3,36,Phineas,"Okay, I guess we could consider this a sort of preliminary test before the real test."
3,36,Candace,"Sh'ya! Now preliminary test his heap, and back to work. And what is this thing, anyway?"
3,36,Phineas,Don't worry! The theme song will explain everything!
3,36,Candace,Theme song?
3,36,(Song,Perrytronic)
3,36,Phineas,It tested perfect! Looks like we're are done!
3,36,Candace,"Oh, no, you're not! Can it bake a pie? Can it train a seal? Can it give change?"
3,36,Phineas,"Wow. She's right, guys. We're not nearly done!"
3,36,Candace,"All right, you busy bees, you're back on the clock! (whispering) B. B. Busting. (normal, on phone) Hello, Mom?"
3,36,Linda,"Yes, Candace? I just checked out, I'm on my way home, now! (doesn't notice her purse left on the counter)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't understand, I really thought two heads were better than one, you know, for the thinking. But I can't think of anything!"
3,36,Both,"Maybe we need a break. We keep doing that! I know, it's so funny! Ahhh! we did it again! And again!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, knock it off. Let's play with our inator for a while!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"(chuckles) Now, this is fun!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"I know, right? (laughs)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Look! Two more heads. Ha ha! Look at Perry and his little arms, aren't they adorable?"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"You're right, let's make more."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Oh, look! A little arm that can move around on its own, (the arm frees Perry) It's got its own volition. I did not expect that. Wait, you dummkopf! Look what you've done! (the arm attacks him)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, who's the Dummkopf now, Dummkopf?"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,Hit him! Hit him!
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, good idea! (repeatedly fires the ray at Perry, cloning his arms)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Not with the ray, you nincompoop! Oh, point that somewhere else!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,(turns the inator around) Like this? (repeatedly fires ray) How is this helping? I don't understand your logic.
3,36,Candace,Mom? Where are you now?
3,36,Linda,I just pulled up the driveway.
3,36,Candace,"You guys are still working, right?"
3,36,Phineas,Just taking a break before we install the chicken incubator.
3,36,Candace,"Mom, look in the backyard, now!"
3,36,Linda,"Hang on, let me put the groceries away."
3,36,Candace,Ee-ee-ee-ee... (at the kids) Don't. Stop. Working.
3,36,Linda,"No, I'm just shutting the front door!"
3,36,Candace,I need you in the kitchen. Mom?
3,36,Linda,"In the bathroom, putting away soap!"
3,36,Candace,"How did I just miss you? Mom? (to Phineas and Ferb) Work, work, work! (to Linda, knocking on door) Mom, come out of the bathroom, quick!"
3,36,Linda,"Nope, I'm in your room! You said you needed tissues."
3,36,Candace,"But how did you -- okay, I'm on my way. (goes upstairs, sees the kids) Put that lemonade down! You're not done yet!"
3,36,Linda,I'm back in the kitchen.
3,36,Candace,(watching the kids) Okay. Listen very carefully. Look. Out. The window.
3,36,Linda,"(from the phone) Oh, my goodness!"
3,36,Candace,Ee-ee-ee-ee...yeah? Yeah?
3,36,Linda,We really need to paint that fence!
3,36,Candace,...What? That's all you have to say?!
3,36,Linda,"(from the phone) Hang on, Candace. My other line is ringing!"
3,36,Candace,How could she not notice that?
3,36,Linda,"(from the phone) Candace, that was the supermarket. I left my pocketbook there. I'm gonna run over and pick it up."
3,36,Candace,"Mom, no! (runs out, but is too late) Mom! Oh, no, I'm too...too...two houses?!?"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,Uh...distract them for me!
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Yeah, I'll give them a licking they'll never forget!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,Good one!
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Thanks! (a few of the arms tickle him, he laughs) That tickles! Quit it! (grunts)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"(runs up to the inator but the arms pull him back) Noooooooo! Oh, you guys are so annoying. You're kinda cute, though. (two of the arms punch him) Get off!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 2,Really? That's the best you got?
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 6,Kinda obvious.
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 7,Juvenile.
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 4,I liked it.
3,36,"Doofenshmirtz heads 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7",You would!
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, you guys are kind of annoying, too. GET HIM! (tosses heads at Perry)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 2,You guys get phantom pains? I got a heck of one in my elbow right now.
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,Ha ha!
3,36,"What? It just -- vanished? What's wrong with this thing? (looks at the microwave timer, it says ""3","00"") Oh, the microwave was on the ""baked potato"" setting, so I guess everything is just gonna last for three minutes. My bad!"
3,36,Candace,"Mom, Mom! Mom, get ready to have your eyes opened wide!"
3,36,Linda,"Just a sec, hon."
3,36,Candace,(turns around and gestures toward second house with eyes closed) Look!
3,36,Candace,But...but but but but but...
3,36,Linda,"Oh, when are they ever going to build something in that empty lot? (leaves)"
3,36,Candace,"Wait! I don't have to ""but, but, but"". I have the Perrytronic 3000! (runs off) Mom?!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"(grunts) Ooh, I hate you, you little green -- (the arms punch him and disappear, he punches himself) Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't have to do this anymore. (at Perry) Well, we still have you surrounded, Perry the Platypus."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 2,"Hey, that disappearing thing's not gonna happen to us, is it?"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head 5,"Yeah, a microwave timer. Great idea. (disappears)"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that's unfortunate."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,You're telling me?
3,36,Linda,"""Step 4: Insert spaghetti into meat""."
3,36,Candace,"(barges in from backyard) Mom, Mom, Mom! This time it's for keeps. Turn around, and look in the yard."
3,36,Linda,But I have to inject the cheese. Just let me finish.
3,36,Candace,"No, I can't let you finish! They might be finished!"
3,36,Linda,"OH! I'll just order a pizza! All right, Candace, let's see what you've got..."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,"Not the golf clubs, NOT THE GOLF CLUBS! (screams) SAVE ME!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"There's a pun here, I know it."
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,(continues screaming)
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,He looks teed off! That's what it was! (turns around) Huh?
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no! My inator!"
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,We've got to do something.
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,You're right. (throws the head) Go get him.
3,36,Doofenshmirtz head,Ouch! Ouch! Ow! Ow! Oh! Why couldn't I have disappeared before I hit the ground? Curse -- (disappears)
3,36,Doofenshmirtz,"What? Now, I'll never know what he was going to say! (the inator explodes, Perry flies away) Oh, yeah, yeah, that."
3,36,Candace,Ee-ee-ee-ee...
3,36,Linda,"Hello, Perry. (to Candace) Okay, that was a nice change of pace. (to the kids) Who wants pizza?"
3,36,Phineas/Buford/Isabella,Me!
3,36,Baljeet,I do!
3,36,Linda,"Then, maybe ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cut in the shape of a sandwich."
3,36,Ferb,"Just pie for me, please."
3,36,Candace,"Okay, now I have to ""but, but, but""."
3,36,(Song,Perrytronic)
3,5,(Scene opens up in Phineas and Ferb's room showing that Phineas is sleeping)(Then the alarm clock at 6,"59 AM. As it goes off, it makes a party blower sound, shows the words ""Happy Birthday"", two star flags pop up and confetti rains all over the alarm clock)"
3,5,Phineas,"(Wakes up, snoozes alarm clock) Another fantastic year older, and this is gonna be the best birthday ever! So, what are we gonna do, Ferb? (Camera pans to Ferb's bed, showing a card) Ferb? (Camera zooms in) Huh! A note! (Gets off his bed) ""For the celebration of your birthday, just follow these clues to show you the way"". Cool! It's like a birthday adventure. But hey, where's Ferb?"
3,5,Candace,"(Talking on her cell phone) I can't believe it! It's Phineas's birthday, and I still don't know what to get him! What can you get for the boy who can make everything? (Sighs) It's my fault. I should have been thinking about this before, but I've just been so distracted by trying to bust Phineas and-- Wait! (Notices Ferb behind a tree; The garage door opens and Ferb runs into the garage) What is he up to? T-T-Y-L, Stacy!"
3,5,Isabella,"Hey, Ferb! (Ferb takes off his fedora) We were just discussing our plans for Phineas' birthday. The circus we ordered won't be arriving 'til later in the day, (Irving walks up) but Irving had a great idea for a warm-up."
3,5,Irving,We should make a video compilation of all of Phineas' greatest moments!
3,5,Buford,What? Like on a clip show? (Crosses his arms) Lame.
3,5,Irving,"Not where a genius like Phineas is concerned, watch this. (Turns on TV)"
3,5,(Clips,Phineas quotes)
3,5,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. Let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull. (Ferb presses a button on a controller)"
3,5,Phineas,"(Explaining Candace her mission) After you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free-fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch."
3,5,Phineas,"(In a video game) Wow, a castle! Nice art direction, Ferb."
3,5,Phineas,"(Riding on a rocket attached to a bike with Ferb and Candace) Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh?"
3,5,Phineas,"(Showing a giant paper-maché plane) Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes."
3,5,Phineas,(Showing Isabella a dining room) Behold! A romantic candlelit dinner for two.
3,5,Phineas,(Building a giant card house) We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat.

3,5,Candace,Will you please tell me what's going on here?
3,5,Phineas,We're building an animation studio.
3,5,Phineas,(Exiting a giant bowling ball) That was amazing!
3,5,Phineas,"(With Linda's tricked-out car) The flying car of the future, today, is still pulling a bit to the right."

3,4,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. What are you up to today?"
3,4,Candace,"Well, I'll probably try to bust you guys... again! And fail... again! And add another link to my summer-long chain of disappointment and regrets."
3,4,Phineas,"(Oblivious) How about that, Ferb, Candace already knows what she's gonna do today!"
3,4,Clyde,Soo... how's the antique business?
3,4,Lawrence,"Ooh, it's just fine. You know, they have a saying in the antique business."
3,4,Clyde,What is it?
3,4,Lawrence,What is what?
3,4,Clyde,The saying. That you use in the antique business.
3,4,Lawrence,"Oh, I don't use it. But there is one."
3,4,Phineas,"Hi, dad! Hi, grandpa! We're not interrupting, are we?"
3,4,Clyde,"No, no! No, come in, boys."
3,4,Phineas,Ferb and I were just talking about the time you build the balloon and won the most famous balloon race in history. Tell us that story again?
3,4,Clyde,"Well, I went out to the barn, I built a balloon and I won the most famous balloon race in history."
3,4,Phineas,Wow!
3,4,Ferb,He makes history come alive.
3,4,Phineas,"Come on, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. If you need us, we'll be out in the barn!"
3,4,Phineas,"Cool! Just look at all this great stuff. Hey, where's Perry?"
3,4,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P! After extensive research and computer data analysis we have concluded that the Tri-State Area is experiencing an unprecedented shortage of eggs. We need you to investigate. Good luck, Agent P."
3,4,Major Monogram,You there! Weren't you listening? Go make some eggs!
3,4,Betty Jo,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! You might wanna use the sugar unless you want salty lemonade!"
3,4,Linda,"Oh, I can't wait to get new contacts. I'm as blind as a bat without them."
3,4,Betty Jo,"Here, use my spare set of glasses."
3,4,Linda,"Wow, now everything is different kind of blurry."
3,4,Betty Jo,"Hi, stranger. Come on in. Everyone, you remember Glenda?"
3,4,Linda,"Of course! Candace, Glenda was the first female train conductor in the entire Tri-State Area!"
3,4,Betty Jo,"But alas, the train is being decommissioned. And today is Glenda's last trip."
3,4,Glenda,And you know what? I'm gonna take her up to Gearheart Summit.
3,4,Betty Jo,"(gasps) But nobody has ever taken a train up Gearheart Summit, it's too steep!"
3,4,Glenda,"Well, that's what they say, but I'm not the one to give up!"
3,4,Betty Jo,It's just like you became a conductor.
3,4,Glenda,"That's right. They told me to give up! (Candace is interested.) But I never give up! (Candace smiles a little.) I'm not the kind of person to give up! (Candace smiles more.) Well, I'm gonna prove that an old train can make it up those tracks. You guys wanna come with me?"
3,4,Betty Jo,We should all go.
3,4,Linda,Sounds like fun!
3,4,Glenda,Okay! Train leaves the station at ten sharp! See you there!
3,4,Betty Jo,"Isn't she something, Candace? That's a woman who would never give up!"
3,4,Glenda,(echoing in Candace's memory) Give up! Blah blah! Give up! Blah blah blah blah blah! Give up! Blah blah blah! Give up!
3,4,Candace,It's so simple! I don't know how I didn't think about it before!
3,4,Candace,I'll give up!
3,4,(Song,"""Give Up"")"
3,4,♪ But it's not really failure if you're not even trying,♪
3,4,Candace,"That's right, I never even suited up, folks!"
3,4,Candace,I threw the baby out with the bathwater!
3,4,Candace,I forgot the Alamo!
3,4,Candace,I'm not even going for the bronze!
3,4,Candace,"I'm staying right here, man."
3,4,Candace,"In this hammock. I like it. Aw, it's beautiful, man."
3,4,Phineas,"Okay everyone, let's get this race started. Contact!"
3,4,Buford,Last one at the top of the mountain is a stinky dish sponge!
3,4,Isabella,What'cha dooooin'?
3,4,Phineas,About... five knots.
3,4,Isabella,"Thought so, I'm doing six! See you at the summit, slowpokes!"
3,4,Buford,"Hey, we're falling behind! What's happening?"
3,4,Baljeet,Excessive weight seems to be hampering our progress.
3,4,Buford,"Yeah, we have to lighten the load. (throws Baljeet out of the basket)"
3,4,Baljeet,"Aaah, aah! How does dangling me from a rope lighten our load?"
3,4,Buford,"Meh, it lightens my spirit."
3,4,Baljeet,"(hitting various obstacles) Ow! Ow, ow ow!"
3,4,Buford,Mountain lion! (mountain lion roars)
3,4,Baljeet,Aaah!
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,"(sighs) Ah, Perry the Platypus. Well, I guess it serves me right for bringing work on vacation with me. Aaand there it is. (Perry is trapped in a egg-shaped container) Man, are we in a rut. Anyway, this is my Dodo-Bird-Incubator... well, you know... -inator. With this amazing device I can transform any egg to a Dodo egg. Once they hatch I will march my terrifying Dodo bird army across the Tri-State Area. You know, I don't really know what they look like, but they're extinct like dinosaurs, so just imagine! Giant, extinct dinosaur-like monsters laying waste to the city! Ah, you know, you, you really picked me up out of my doldrums."
3,4,Betty Jo,"We're all here and ready to help, what would you like us to do?"
3,4,Glenda,"Just sit back and enjoy the view, the train will do all the work."
3,4,Candace,Doin' nothing? Got that covered.
3,4,Glenda,"All aboard! Gearheart Summit, here we come!"
3,4,Orville Wilkins,You'll never make it! You should give up!
3,4,Wilbur Wilkins,"Yeah, give up, woo-hoo!"
3,4,Glenda,"So long boys, and don't forget to clean your rooms!"
3,4,Orville/Wilbur,"Yes, mom."
3,4,Orville,It's your fault.
3,4,Wilbur,"Quiet, you!"
3,4,Phineas,Looks like a dead heat so far.
3,4,Baljeet,We need to pick up the pace.
3,4,Buford,"Alright, I'll get rid of this. (throws a taxidermied marlin away)"
3,4,Baljeet,I do not know why you even brought the swordfish!
3,4,Buford,It's a marlin.
3,4,Baljeet,Oh no...
3,4,Buford,"Little help, guys!"
3,4,Phineas,Ferb.
3,4,Linda,"So Candace, you sure seem relaxed. What's up? (behind her, the kids in their balloons can be seen through the window)"
3,4,Candace,I'm just taking in the ride and not worrying about what Phineas and Ferb are up to.
3,4,Linda,"Well good for you, honey. Cause I've got gin."
3,4,Betty Jo,We're playing Kings Corners.
3,4,Linda,Are we?
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,It's working! (the egg begins to hatch) It's wonderful! It's amazing! It's...! (giant dodo bird hatches)
3,4,Dodo,Narg narg narg! Narg!
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,It's... (sighs) not quite as terrifying as I hoped.
3,4,Dodo,Narg!
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,"How am I supposed to take over the Tri-State Area with a bunch of these? Where's the horror, the terror the- (Perry gets out of his trap) Oh nooo! You, you'll have to wait in line, Perry the Platypus! First I gotta deal with this! I mean, this looks like a turkey, it's like Thanksgiving. (Dodo bird pecks Doofenshmirtz furiously) It's EXACTLY like Thanksgiving!"
3,4,Candace,"Hey, Glenda, how's it going?"
3,4,Glenda,Mighty fine! You're looking chipper.
3,4,Candace,"Oh yeah, I've been feeling great ever since I decided to heed your advice and give up."
3,4,Glenda,Come again?
3,4,Candace,"Well, all summer I've been just thinking about busting my brothers, but after your speech this morning I've just gave up. And now I'm much more relaxed."
3,4,Glenda,So what you got from my speech about how you should never give up is that you should give up?
3,4,Candace,"Well, you did say ""give up"" a lot."
3,4,Glenda,"I did say that, didn't I."
3,4,Candace,"Ah, Glenda? Glenda! The train is slowing down."
3,4,Glenda,So it is. I guess we're out of coal. (sits down) Oh well.
3,4,Candace,"What? You can't give up! No coal means no steam, and no steam means we can't make up the hill!"
3,4,Glenda,Meh.
3,4,Candace,We gotta do something! We need fuel! Wait! I have an idea that just might work. And don't think I don't know what you're up to. I'll be right back.
3,4,Linda,She's such an active child.
3,4,Candace,"Just out of curiosity, what's going to happen to this train after today?"
3,4,Glenda,"It'll be torn apart and an sold for scrap, why?"
3,4,Candace,No reason.
3,4,"(At the grandparents' house, Lawrence and Clyde sit in silence; in the background Doofenshmirtz runs from the dodo bird, screaming. Back in the train",)
3,4,Linda,What are we playing again?
3,4,Isabella,"Hey Phineas, what'cha doin' over there?"
3,4,Phineas,"My steering is a little loose, I think that- (stops, looks behind)"
3,4,Isabella,(suddenly standing next to Phineas) Do you need some help?
3,4,Phineas,"Well, yeah. Can you hold the wheel while I tighten it?"
3,4,Isabella,(holds it) Gladly!
3,4,Phineas,"Well, that's perfect."
3,4,Isabella,"Yes. Yes, it is."
3,4,Phineas,"Check it out! A dodo bird! What's next on the list, Ferb?"
3,4,Ferb,(crossing off a list of the title sequence) Frankenstein's brain.
3,4,Buford,"Yeeeah, uh, that was in my balloon."
3,4,Candace,"Woo-hoo! Yes, we made it! I knew we could, I knew we could, I knew we could!"
3,4,Glenda,"Oh, did you now?"
3,4,Candace,"Yeah, you can drop the act. I know you didn't forget to bring coal. It's probably in that box you're sitting on. But...lesson learned, and as long as I'm no longer giving up, I'm gonna go bust Phineas and Ferb. (jumps through the window) Thanks!"
3,4,Glenda,I could have forgot the coal! (beat) I'm old!
3,4,Linda,Do you notice anything different here?
3,4,Betty Jo,Yeah! Everything's half off at the gift shop!
3,4,Phineas,"Here we are! Gearheart Summit. Let's put them down over there, Ferb."
3,4,Candace,"(looking at Ferb's outfit in the gift shop) Why is it every store sells this outfit? (notices the balloons) Mom, mom! Look what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Come quick! (points at the outfits and the head-shaped balloons behind them) Look, look! Right there! You see?! You see?!"
3,4,Linda,Okay Candace. (adjusts the glasses)
3,4,Linda,"Oh, hello, boys. (walks away)"
3,4,Candace,...What? (turns around) No!
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,A-ha! (runs to the balloon)
3,4,Dodo,"Narg, narg, narg, narg! (runs into the second balloon)"
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,"Sayonara, dodo! (both balloons take off) Hey, how did you start that with no opposable thumbs?"
3,4,Candace,"Mom, look, it's just forced perspective, look! They're not really here! (The real Phineas and Ferb come over.) It's an optical illusion! He's not really --"
3,4,Phineas,"Hi, Candace!"
3,4,Candace,Aaah!
3,4,Phineas,How was the train ride?
3,4,Candace,"(pause) Oh, I give up. (walks away)"
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,(sighs) Some vacation this turned out to be. (the dodo makes a hole in his balloon)
3,4,Farmer's Wife,"So you bought a Museum of Biological Oddities, but you didn't get any biological oddities?(Doofenshmirtz falls through the roof)"
3,4,Doofenshmirtz,Huh. What? (dodo falls in and lands on him)
3,4,Farmer's Wife,There it is!
3,4,Dodo,Narg narg narg! Narg!
3,37,Phineas,"Well, Perry, as soon as I send in your photo you'll be a contestant in the Totally Tools spokes-animal contest. (looks at Perry) What do you say boy? Ready to be a spokes-animal?"
3,37,Mandy,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Stop the Busting Retreat, a one-day seminar to teach us all to use sisterly restraint. And today, we welcome our newest member, Candace Flynn. Candace, this is Anne, Sunisa and Danielle."
3,37,Candace,"(waves a hand) Yeah, hi."
3,37,Mandy,"What we like to do now is a little exercise. We'll start with you, Anne. (clicks a button on a remote) This is your picture of your brother turning your mother's flower bed into a swimming pool. What do you do?"
3,37,Anne,"Well, being a non-buster, I'll probably go to the mall and get a mani-pedi."
3,37,Mandy,"Good! (at Candace) See how it's done, Candace? (clicks button again) Think you can do that?"
3,37,Candace,Ha! Are you kidding? Just try me.
3,37,Mandy,"Okay, so, (clicks button for the third time) you see your brothers making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, You...?"
3,37,Candace,"Well, being a non-buster, I wouldn't bust them for making a sandwich. But I'd bust them for making a sandwich when it's 5:30 in the afternoon, and we'll all be having supper in a half-hour! They'll ruin their appetites! They are so busted!"
3,37,Mandy,"Okay, who here can tell me where Candace's approach could use a little improving? (Everyone except Mandy raises their hand) Candace, put your hand down."
3,37,Manager,"Okay, welcome to Totally Tools. Now, where is that contest-winning platypus of yours? (gasps) Oh, will you look at him. Oh, and he sits up, too! Who says they don't do much? Brilliant! But sitting up isn't enough. He has to say, ""Totally Tools"". (pause) I got nothing. What do you guys think?"
3,37,Phineas,How about a hat?
3,37,Manager,Brilliant!
3,37,Phineas,"Ferb, I know we're gonna do today. We're gonna put a hat on Perry. (places a hat on Perry's head)"
3,37,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
3,37,Manager,"Hang on a minute. Wait, go back two."
3,37,Manager,"Brilliant! (picks up Perry, now wearing a... fedora) Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora. Boys, he's got a lot of work to do. (hands Perry to Phineas) Get busy!"
3,37,Phineas,"Come on, Ferb. (runs off with Ferb following him)"
3,37,Manager,Those boys are brilliant!
3,37,Assistant,"Sir, your 10:30 balloon is here."
3,37,Manager,Brilliant!
3,37,Major Monogram,"Mmm, hello?"
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"(off-screen) Francis! Hi, it's me, Heinz."
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,Have you seen Perry the Platypus?
3,37,Major Monogram,"Dr. Doofenshmirtz, that information is highly classified and strictly confidential."
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,You have no idea where he is.
3,37,Major Monogram,Not a clue.
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, thanks!"
3,37,Major Monogram,"Oh, hey, hang on. Say, what kind of an evil scheme you got going on there today?"
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it isn't so much an evil scheme as much as a childish prank, but I've invented a Mustache-inator! (pause) It gives people big, bushy, ridiculous-looking mustaches. Because, as we all know, there's nothing sillier than a big, bushy... (chuckles nervously) All right, uh, uh... But hey, you know, it looks good on you!"
3,37,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, today we give you the new face of Totally Tools, (blue curtains opens) Perry the Platypus!"
3,37,Man in audience,Yeah! Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora.
3,37,Manager,"Boys, this campaign of yours has really put us over the top. What else you got?"
3,37,Phineas,"Well, Ferb came up with an idea for an exploding billboard."
3,37,Manager,Brilliant!
3,37,Boy,"Hey, look! It's a Totally Tools publicity stunt."
3,37,Man,Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora hanging from a blimp!
3,37,Major Monogram,"Oh, hello, Agent P. We have a situation. With all these new billboards up all over town, you've become too recognizable to be a secret agent. So we had to send Agent S to Doofenshmirtz's in your place. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go on hiatus until your 15 minutes of fame are up."
3,37,Manager,"I gotta tell you, boys, our president, Tom Totally, thinks you're doing such a brilliant job!"
3,37,Phineas,"Sounds great. (at Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. We can spend the rest of the day with you for a change."
3,37,(Song,Let's Spend Half a Day)
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,Pew! A handlebar. Pew! A pencil thin. Pew! Fu Manchu!
3,37,Candace,"Okay, this is quite a jump from group affirmations. How is this contraption supposed to help me resist the urge to bust my brothers?"
3,37,Mandy,"It's a positive reinforcement machine. When you ignore your busting impulses, you get a reward. Let's try it out."
3,37,Candace,"Well, I'm just gonna... I ignore it?"
3,37,Automated voice,"Ooh! Who's a good girl? You are the good girl. Yes, you are."
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"There! That ought to hold you. Lucky thing Mrs. Thompson had some salt I could borrow. (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah, consider yourself ""a salted"". Ah, man, I'm writing that one down. And now, to business. See that guy there with the beard?"
3,37,Phineas,"Fetch the ball, Perry!"
3,37,Major Monogram,"(on wrist communicator) Agent P, Doof found Agent S's weakness. We need you to drop everything and return to duty."
3,37,Mandy,"Now, Candace, your brothers have issued a gold-based currency which has seriously devalued the euro. What do you do?"
3,37,Candace,(laughs) I do nothing!
3,37,Automated voice,"You are the good girl, yes, you are!"
3,37,Candace,"Wow, you were right. This is quite a machine. Where did you get it, anyway?"
3,37,Mandy,Phineas and Ferb made it for... (covers her mouth with a hand)
3,37,Candace,What did you say?
3,37,Mandy,N-n-n-nothing. (screams)
3,37,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, why do you always build these things? It's impossible to bust you for everything! It's not my job! Not my job! (realizes) Not my job?"
3,37,Mandy,"Candace, you had your breakthrough! (hugs Candace) I'm so proud of you."
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,Ha! Did you see that? I just put a mustache on that dog's...
3,37,Candace,"Well, ladies, thanks for everything."
3,37,Mandy,Uh-oh.
3,37,Candace,"(inhales deeply) Sisters, I know what you're thinking, but rest assured, this new Candace that you see before you will not react like the crazed little girl that crawled in here just this morning."
3,37,Mandy,"Good for you, Candace!"
3,37,Candace,"For now, I am, and will always be, an older sister who is positive and mature."
3,37,Mandy,"That's right, Candace."
3,37,Candace,"And I am absolutely 100% positive that I have to bust my brothers. I can see it in your eyes! You know I'm right! Sisters, will we bust our brothers?"
3,37,Mandy,Yes!
3,37,All,"Yes, we will!"
3,37,Candace,"Sisters, repeat after me. Bust! Bust! Bust..."
3,37,All,Bust! Bust! Bust!.... (repeats)
3,37,Mandy,"(stops chanting, realizing something) Whoa, whoa, whoa! What just happened?"
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Just for the record, Perry the Platypus, I was thwarted by Sergei the Snail, not you! You don't get any credit for this."
3,37,Carl,"Uh, sir, you're playing with your lip again."
3,37,Major Monogram,"Oh, I can't help it, Carl. I miss the old duster."
3,37,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, that was interesting. You defaced yourself. (pause) I didn't see that coming. To be honest, you have lost me completely."
3,37,Manager,"But, Mr. Totally, I have no idea who put those mustaches on those posters. It wasn't my fault!"
3,37,Mr. Totally,I want every one of these ad torn down totally! They're mocking me!
3,37,Manager,"Yes, sir. Yes, sir, all torn down. Brilliant! (crashes) Trash can!"
3,37,Candace,"Oh, they are so busted!"
3,37,Linda,"Well, I guess that answered the inflatable legs question. (at Candace) Now, what is it, Candace?"
3,37,Candace,Look and see for yourself! You won't believe it!
3,37,Linda,Candace...
3,37,Candace,"Okay, now, look up there! (points toward the billboard)"
3,37,Linda,I'm astonished.
3,37,Candace,Yes! Finally!!
3,37,Linda,"""Nothing says Totally Tools like a snail in a fedora."""

3,44,Candace,"(Talking on the phone) ...So I said, ""You're not getting me up into the mountains on a day like this"", (She is on the couch with dozens of fans) I'm staying right here, with my beautiful air conditioning. I'm just gonna chillax right through this one."
3,44,Isabella,"Thanks for letting us host the French Fireside Girls at your cabin, Mr. and Mrs. Flynn. This'll be a great place for them to get their North American Tracking patches."
3,44,Clyde,What did I do again?
3,44,Phineas,"The French Fireside Girls, or le filles coin du feu, as they're known in their country of orgin, are going for their North American Tracking patches. And you're helping us help them."
3,44,Betty Jo,I put a sticky note on your shirt.
3,44,Clyde,"(sees the note) Aww. And you wrote ""love"". (whispers as they leave) I knew it was there."
3,44,Betty Jo,Why do you play senile?
3,44,Clyde,I love your notes!

3,44,Brigitte,"Dacaz. I am Brigitte, and these are Josette and Collette."
3,44,Josette/Collette,Bonjour!
3,44,Isabella,(gestures to Phineas and Ferb) And this is --
3,44,Brigitte,Phineas et Ferb! (Holds up newspaper) We read your column in Le filles en coin de feu Gazette.
3,44,Isabella,(Humbly) I'm syndicated.
3,44,Phineas,Matre de maz.
3,44,Baljeet,"(He wheels in a large crate with a tarp over it) Everyone, please stand back! Keep your fingers, and berets away from the bars."
3,44,Isabella,"Le filles coin du feu, to earn your American Tracking Patch, you'll have to capture the most dangerous of creatures, the vicious, American, (She pulls away the tarp, revealing Buford in a bear costume) grizzly bear."
3,44,Baljeet,He has not been fed.
3,44,Isabella,My friend has graciously agreed to be the bear for today's hunt.
3,44,Baljeet,Excuse me. (He goes around to the back of the cage) What is up?
3,44,Buford,(he pulls Baljeet inside) Get in here! I know that girl out there!
3,44,Baljeet,You do?
3,44,Buford,"Yeah, we met, in Paris. (He flashes back) It was a year ago, and I was taking in some of the local color, when I saw her, Brigitte. She was a beautiful french girl, and I was an ugly American. Which of course holds a certain mystique. With her I completely forgot myself. I read poetry, I wept at beauty, I clipped my toenails. For Brigitte, I even learned to speak the language of love, French talk."
3,44,Baljeet,"Oh, that is why you are fluent in French."
3,44,Buford,"It was easy actually. A lot of the root words are the same in Latin. But I can't let anyone know I have a heart, it'll ruin my tough-guy image. And believe me, the irony is not lost on me in this suit. Aw man, don't you see, if I get all gushy now, I'll be totally exposed! I can't stand it! (He pushes Baljeet aside, and flees the cage)"
3,44,Isabella,There he goes. Let the tracking begin. (The girls run after him)
3,44,Baljeet,"Wait, you speak Latin!?"
3,44,Phineas,Go get 'em girls!
3,44,Clyde,"You'll never catch me running around in a fuzzy bear suit, (He passes for a moment) in this heat."
3,44,Phineas,It is a tad sweltering. A little fun with water might be in order.
3,44,Clyde,Way ahead of ya' kiddo. (He shows them a sprinkler)
3,44,Phineas,"You're on the right track Grandpa, mind if we kick it up a notch?"
3,44,Clyde,I was hoping you might.
3,44,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry?"
3,44,Major Monogram,"Good morning Agent P. I'd tell you what Doofenshmirtz is up to but the screen isn't big enough for the little box thingy over my shoulder, but I'm sure you'll figure it out when you get there. Good luck Agent P."
3,44,Monogram,"♪ Oh give me a home, where the buffalo--♪ Moth! Moth!"
3,44,Buford,"Of all the clearings, of all the woods, in all the world, she had to walk into mine. (Buford's phone rings) Tell me she was deported!"
3,44,Baljeet,"Buford, what are you doing?"
3,44,Buford,The forest is crawlin' with patch-crazed Europeans and I'm a bear in the woods. What do you think I'm doing?
3,44,Phineas,Ooh! Ooh! I know!
3,44,Buford,Am I on speaker phone? GET ME OFF OF SPEAKER PHONE!
3,44,Brigitte,This way I see a score.
3,44,Buford,They're comin'!
3,44,Phineas,How's he doin' Baljeet?
3,44,Brigitte,I want his fuzzy fent on my wall!
3,44,Baljeet,"Ha, well..."
3,44,Phineas,You want to help us make a super-sprinkler?
3,44,Baljeet,"Yes, yes I do."
3,44,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, Perry the Platypus, are you felling tired?"
3,44,Doofenshmirtz,"Take a rest! I figured you'd be exhausted after breaking all those doors. I-I even put a mint on your pillow, and everything, though, I guess it's probably just stuck to the back of your head now. Sorry about that. So, let's talk about pretzels. You see Perry the Platypus, when I was younger, (Doofenshmirtz flashes back) I did a summer internship at Master Drakkenblad's Pretzel Palace, He was the biggest pretzel wizard in Drusselstein. His disproportionately delicate hands, could turn any dough into a masterpiece. But even after months, my pretzel still lacked, polish. No matter how hard I tried, my work was never good enough. I don't know why he was such a stickler, I mean it's a knot. What difference does it make as long as you can't untie it? It's a knot! Anyway, I was declared unworthy. (Doofenshmirtz's Flash back ends) So now I despise pretzels. And any pretzel related entertainment. And now Danville is having it's own Pretzel Festival! Can you even imagine how angry that makes me? Can you imagine? No? Angry enough to create the De-Twist-inator! We'll see how festive they feel after I turn all those stupid pretzels into boring straight tubes of baked dough, like-like breadsticks, which I also have a problem with, but I'm dealing with one neurosis at a time. And then, when I've straightened all their precious pretzels, I will waltz in, and take over the Tri-State Area. Yeah, I know it doesn't quite follow. I mean I even made a venn diagram. (He hold up a venn diagram, with to circles, not intersecting at all) See, the-the pretzels are here in this circle, and we're talking about taking over the Tri-State Area here, and... Yeah, no intersection, nothing. Hmm. But I'm gonna work it out you'll see."
3,44,Brigitte,"You see here, these tracks indicated, that he went in that direction."
3,44,Isabella,"Great! Come on, let's check it out!"
3,44,Brigitte,"But, the weight was on the balls of his feet instead of the heels, he retraced his steps to here. Voilà! the footprints continue here. This way, the hunt is on!"
3,44,(Song,"""Runnin' from Love (In a Bear Suit)"")"
3,44,Brigitte,"Fireside Girls, goggle on. (The Fireside Girls don goggles) He has gone completely animal. He smells us. Pursue!"
3,44,Doofenshmirtz,"And when the chickens hatch, that's when the marshmallows kick in. Oh, oh boy, this one really taxed my brain. I am telling you, I am pooped. Anyway, forget the details, the circles are touching so the plan can't miss. Now, I've got a pretzel problem, and I'm about to straighten it out. Hahaha, you see? 'Cause their pretzels, their twisted, their not straight. It's- You like that one Perry the Platypus? I've been saving it up. (Perry twists around in his trap, and using the mist that got stuck to his head, he rips off the sheet tying him down. He then launches himself at Doofenshmirtz, and causes the -inator the fire off a few shots, hitting a girl with curly hair, a yoga class, and a roller coaster)"
3,44,Phineas,"Hey Buford, what do you think of our super sprinkler? We used low turbulence mechanics, and specific gravity to make the water hold it's shape while in motion."
3,44,Buford,You had me at super sprinkler.
3,44,Brigitte,There he is!
3,44,Isabella,Get 'em girls!
3,44,Brigitte,You cannot escape!
3,44,Brigitte,"You think I am afraid of a little water, bear? Think again! (Brigitte runs after Buford)"
3,44,Buford,What the-?! Aw man.
3,44,Isabella,She is really serious about getting this patch.
3,44,Josette and Collette,Oui.
3,44,Buford,(To Baljeet) Where have you been?
3,44,Baljeet,"Dude, it is not my problem."
3,44,Phineas,"Ferb, did you order a bear?"
3,44,Phineas,"Oh man, that would have been so funny without the snorkel."
3,44,Brigitte,Move it or lose it!
3,44,Buford,(He comes to the end of the super sprinkler) It just stops? How is that possible?
3,44,Brigitte,There is nowhere left to run bear!
3,44,Buford,No! No! Don't look at me.
3,44,Brigitte,Buford?
3,44,Doofenshmirtz,See? Another reason to hate twisting. Curse you Perry the Platypus. (The De-Twist-inator blows up)
3,44,Brigitte,Buford!
3,44,Buford,No! I'm not me! I'm somebody else!
3,44,Brigitte,"Buford, I know it is you, but why would hide from me?"
3,44,Buford,"(He sighs heavily) Oh, Brigitte, I've spent years building up my tough-guy street cred. I can bounce back from the fuzzy bear suit, but being in love with a beautiful, sweet, exotic girl like yourself... If people found out about that, my image would be fini"
3,44,Brigitte,"Oh, Buford, you silly boy. I'm a well bread, refined European. I would never let the fireside girls know that I was vaguely interested in brute such as you. in fact, (She slaps Buford across the face) au revoir (She swims away)"
3,44,Baljeet,You okay buddy?
3,44,Buford,(Dreamily) She said she was vaguely interested in me.
3,50,Candace's Brain,"Has it come to this? (looks closer) Just standing out in the yard, (Camera zooms out, showing Phineas and Ferb sitting by the tree) Staring at your brothers, waiting? (Zoom into Phineas and Ferb) They're gonna do something bustable, I know it."
3,50,Candace's Brain,(Gasps) It's Jeremy!
3,50,Candace,(Flips the phone open) I know who it is! (Speaks into the phone) Hi!
3,50,Jeremy,Hey! Wanna come over today?
3,50,Candace,"Uh, yeah, just checking out the situation around here. (At Phineas, covering the phone) Uh, Phineas, do you know what you're gonna do today?"
3,50,Phineas,No.
3,50,Candace,"No jetpacks? No volleyball? No ""Where's Perry""?"
3,50,Phineas,"Nope, nothing yet."
3,50,Candace,"(At phone) Yeah, I think I'm free. I'll be right over."
3,50,Jeremy,Cool! See ya in a bit! (Hangs up)
3,50,Phineas,"(Off-screen) Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! (Close up of Candace, who is wide-eyed) Let's build jetpacks..."
3,50,Candace,Oh! (Bends down)
3,50,Phineas,(Off-screen) ...And play Volleyball!
3,50,Candace,"Ohh!! (Drops to her knees and drops her phone. She calls Jeremy) Uh, Jeremy, why don't you come over here?"
3,50,Phineas,"Hey Candace, you seen Perry?"
3,50,Candace,Oh!
3,50,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P, I want to apologize for my appearance. You see, I was up all night monitoring Doofenshmirtz. It seems that-- zzzzzzzzzzzz.... Yeah, I'll have cake."
3,50,Carl,(Off-screen) Sir?
3,50,Major Monogram,"(Wakes up) --Up all night, uh, building inators. See what he's-- zzzzzzzzzz...."
3,50,Carl,"(Off-screen) I think you can go, Agent P."
3,50,Candace's Brain,"Ah yes, now that's bustable behavior. You should tell Mom."
3,50,Candace,(whispering) Stop telling me what to do. (At Mom) Mom!
3,50,Candace,"Mom, Jeremy's on his way over here right now. I've got like 5-10 minutes to get the whole ""Busting-Phineas-and-Ferb"" thing over so I can relax and we can enjoy our Saturday."
3,50,Candace,Back. Kitchen door.
3,50,Linda,Done and done.
3,50,Jeremy,"(Wearing a jetpack and has a volleyball in his hand) Hey, Candace! Jetpack Volleyball? This is a great idea! You're gonna join us, right?"
3,50,Candace,"Uh, yeah! I'll be up in just a second. I just got something I gotta do. (Closes door)"
3,50,Linda,I'm ready for our little charade.
3,50,Candace's Brain,(while Candace blocks the door) Mom can't see this! We don't want to get Jeremy in trouble! You've got to keep Mom inside!
3,50,Candace,"(runs off) Oh, Mom! Don't be so silly! You can't go out there until we've uh, uh... (Stammers, pushes Mom to the dishwasher) Unloaded the dishwasher, right! (Chuckles) Right?"
3,50,Linda,But they're not dry yet.
3,50,Candace,"Oh they'll dry, Mom. (Grasps her shoulder) Things dry."
3,50,Linda,Ooh-kee.
3,50,(Cut to,)
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"(On a cell phone) You really think I need aluminum siding? (Perry crashes through the roof and lands on one knee with a hand to the ground.) Oh, oops, gotta go, I got a guest. (hangs up, turns around and claps) Well, Perry the Platypus. Oh, hey, nice landing pose. See, that would kill my knees. (Pushes a remote) Haha!! You're trapped! (Two floorboards come out and trap him.) Let's talk about what you've been up to, Perry the Platypus. You've been sneaking into my lair secretly and building inators in the middle of the night! (Perry looks confused) Oh, don't act all so innocent. Every morning when I wake up, there's a new inator. Look! See? Three of 'em! (Cut to the inators. Cut back to Perry, who shrugs.) Re-Really, you didn't do it? If it wasn't you, then who was it? I mean, you and I are the only ones who are ever here, which is sad in and of itself. B-But I'm not building them in my sleep! (gasps) Wait, that's it! I'm sleep-inventing! That's fabulous!"
3,50,(Song,I'm Unconsciously Creating Truly Evil Inators)
3,50,Norm,Does someone need their spelling checked?
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,No. I just wanted to do this! (He zaps Norm with the inator.)
3,50,Norm,How about a hug?
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,A huginator?!!
3,50,Norm,(walking up to Doofenshmirtz) Unable to resist hugging impulse.
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,(walking back against the wall) No! No! Noooooo!!!!
3,50,(Song,Jetpack Volleyball)
3,50,Candace,See? I told you they would dry.
3,50,Linda,What was that?
3,50,Candace,"Oh...uh...so, Mom, do you have everything for dinner tonight? Maybe you ought to go to the grocery store."
3,50,Linda,Nope. Got everything.
3,50,Candace,"Oh, it's your bridge day! Better get in the car and go! (pushing her mom out)"
3,50,Linda,"It's tomorrow. Candace, why don't you go outside and hang out with the boys?"
3,50,Candace,"Ha ha ha! Outside! Well, there's no reason to go out there!"
3,50,Linda,"Y'know, I don't hear them. Maybe I'll go check."
3,50,Candace,"Oh, ow! Ow, ow! (holding her finger)"
3,50,Linda,"Candace, what is it?"
3,50,Candace,I smashed my finger in the...thing!
3,50,Linda,Where? Let me see.
3,50,Candace,(holds out her finger and moves it) Here!
3,50,Linda,Let...me...see!
3,50,Candace,I need a bandage!
3,50,Linda,"Okay, there's some right—"
3,50,Candace,"No, no! The glow-in-the-dark ones we keep in the emergency kit!"
3,50,Linda,In the basement?
3,50,Candace,Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow...
3,50,Linda,(exits) Okay.
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"W-W-What does this mean? (Cut to Doofenshmirtz in Norm's embracing arms) W-When I'm awake I build evil inators that fail, and when I'm asleep, I build nice inators that work? Ah, what is my subconscious trying to tell me? It's just so exhausting. Ugh, I feel like I've been up all night, which, I, I guess I have, building nice inators, apparently. It's just... (droopily) Yeah, I'm getting sleepy. Ripple dissolve imminent."
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, man, this had better be a dream because I don't like where this is going."
3,50,Linda,"Hon, I looked everywhere. I can't find the bandages."
3,50,Candace,"That's okay, Mom. It's, um, it's all better."
3,50,Linda,Great! Then I'm gonna see if the boys want a—
3,50,Candace,"No! Uh, uh, let's play chess."
3,50,Linda,"Chess? Candace, I don't—"
3,50,Candace,"(putting her hands on her mom's shoulders) We never do anything together, okay? (Takes her mom's hand and drags her) Let's play a nice long game of chess."
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, man, everything here in dreamland is so distorted and ugly. Say... (Wide shot to reveal a short green devilish imp that looks like him) you look familiar."
3,50,Imp,I should. I'm the inner you!
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,Inner me?! Are you the one that's been making those good inators?!?!
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"I was trying to help you, you nincompoop!"
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Yes, late at night, I was instructing you how to make the ultimate inator!"
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"(in flashback) That's enough! Don't overtighten it, like your brain! Now, let's just imagine how it will work."
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,The Cake-O'-Hug-A-Fetti-inator! Fire!
3,50,Skater Dude,"What's happening? Dude, is this cake?"
3,50,Woman,"Ugh, the cake is hugging us!"
3,50,Man,"Hey, everybody, it's okay! We can eat our way out!"
3,50,Man,Ugh! Forget about eating it now! It's covered in paper!
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"It's mine! The Tri-State Area's finally mine! (The building disappears and he falls into a throne and gets crowned. The throne floats into the air surrounded by herald trumpets.) Hey, wait a minute! Wait!"
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, was that a fantasy inside a flashback inside of a dream?"
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"Well, let me put it this way. (Slaps Doofenshmirtz.)"
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,What? What? What?!
3,50,Norm,Did you have a nice nap?
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh, enough with the hugging! Let go!"
3,50,Norm,(lets go of Doofenshmirtz in a manner that sharply throws the evil scientist onto the floor extremely hard) You're da boss!
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"(on the ground moaning) Y'know, I'm gonna make a plug for you so I can unplug you."
3,50,Linda,"Gosh, it's been so long since I've played chess. I can't remember how the knight moves. Do you remember?"
3,50,Candace,I'm not really sure.
3,50,Linda,"(standing up) Oh, the boys'll know."
3,50,Candace,"What?! (sitting Linda back down) No no no! You sit! I'll go ask 'em. (Runs to the sliding door and imitates the sound of the door opening.) Hey, guys! Uh, do you know how the knight moves? (Doing a bad imitation of Phineas.) Uh, yeah, Candace, it moves straight up and then, uh, straight down on the same square. (normal voice) Oh, hey, yeah, that's great! Thanks! Oh, wait, what was that, Ferb? Oh, yeah, you don't talk! (Imitates the sound of the door closing and draws the curtains on the door.)"
3,50,Linda,You know what's funny?
3,50,Candace,What's funny?
3,50,Linda,"I have this weird desire to go outside. (Candace gets more nervous) I mean, normally, around this time of day, you're pulling me to go out in the yard and I kind of have a hankering to do it! It's like a Pavlovian ""go outside"" response. Let's go!"
3,50,Candace,"Oh, Mom, what are you, a robot? You gotta do the same thing every day?"
3,50,Linda,"Okay, Candace, what's going on out there? (Linda walks forward but Candace attempts to push her back.) What don't you want me to see?"
3,50,Candace,"Nothing! Nothing, Mom! (grabs onto her mother's leg) No no no!"
3,50,Linda,"Candace, let go!"
3,50,Candace,"Mom, look! Checkmate! (chuckles nervously)"
3,50,Linda,Candace!
3,50,Candace,Wait! Let's play darts!
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, wow, Perry the Platypus, I just had the freakiest dream. You know those dreams that seem logical while you're having them but are total nonsense when you wake up? (Pushing the inators together) I think I was some kind of 1940s business beaver, oh, and, uh... Oh, I might as well get these three useless things out of my lab and push them out onto the balcony and... (Perry struggles to get out of the trap) Wait a minute! I've seen this before! In my dream! That's right! It's only really effective if I put them all together! (Perry gets out of the trap) Hey, hey, Perry the Platy— (Perry flings into him.)"
3,50,Linda,"I mean it, Candace! You're acting really strange! (Candace dials her phone behind her back.) If I'm gonna go outside, I'm going to go outside! (The house phone rings.) Ugh, there's the phone! Hold that thought! (picks up) Hello?"
3,50,Candace,"Uh, (holding her nose to disguise her voice) please hold for some important information."
3,50,Linda,"Well, okay, as long as it's important."
3,50,Jeremy,"Wow! You guys are the best! This was truly an amazing day! It's too bad Candace missed the whole thing. And, Ferb, where did you learn to serve like that?"
3,50,Ferb,At the Yorkshire Athletic School for In Your Face.
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"I dare you to try that again! (Perry kicks him again and the inators roll away.) Well, I did dare him, I guess. No! No! (The first inator falls off) A third of my inator! (Wide shot of the building as the falling inator activates)"
3,50,Candace,"Jeremy? I guess the game is over? (picks up the volleyball, which gets zapped and turns into a cake.) Cake. Okay..."
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, Norm, a little help, please!"
3,50,Norm,Who needs a hug?
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,Noooo!!!
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm! What did you do, you big garbage disposal?! Now two of them are ruined! (Sarcastically) W-Why don't you just throw the third one over?!"
3,50,Norm,(getting up) If you insist! (Doofenshmirtz flinches in despair realizing what he's done; Norm throws the machine off the balcony)
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,Nooooooo-ho-hooooo!!!!
3,50,Candace,"Well, this has been a weird afternoon."
3,50,Jeremy,Candace! There you are! What's all this?
3,50,Candace,"Well, uh, uh, yeah! Heh! It's our two-month, nine-day anniversary!"
3,50,Jeremy,"Oh, great! Uh, (at Phineas and Ferb) was I supposed to get her a present?"
3,50,Linda,"Hon, if you didn't want me to come out and spoil the surprise, you should have said so. But you are going clean up all this confetti, right?"
3,50,Candace's Brain,Nice going. You busted yourself.
3,50,Candace,"Quiet, you!"
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,So much for that inator.
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh, tell me about it!"
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, what are you doing here?! This isn't a dream!"
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, isn't it?"
3,50,Doofenshmirtz,"No. No, it isn't."
3,50,Inner Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, crud."
3,51,Linda,"Morning, sunshine! So, what are your plans for today, besides running up my phone bill?"
3,51,Candace,"I've got nothing. Every day, I always end up having another failed bust attempt blow up in my face. (throws some milk on a cat) Starting today, no busting, no blow up in face. I'm taking a me-day."
3,51,Linda,I'll believe it when I see it!
3,51,Phineas,"(seeing a poster on a wall) Huh, I've never seen that there before!"
3,51,Lawrence,"Cool, huh? I put that up inspired by my close-encounter."
3,51,Phineas,Close encounter?
3,51,Lawrence,"Oh, yes. You have heard of the Danville crop circles?"
3,51,Isabella,They've been appearing all over town! Some people say that they've been made by spaceships!
3,51,Buford,I don't believe in spaceships!
3,51,Isabella,"But, Buford, you've been in a space ship. Several, actually."
3,51,Buford,I'm a skeptic!
3,51,Lawrence,"Gather 'round kids, and I'll tell you a story about the close-encounter. It was a dark night, and I was out for a drive, when my motorcar began to behave strangely. Twas then when a bright green light started shining and I couldn't help but walking towards the light scource."
3,51,Phineas,What happened?
3,51,Lawrence,"Well, as it turns out, it was just a tow truck driver I had called. He charged up my battery, and off he went!"
3,51,Isabella,"So, if you never saw a UFO, then why did you keep the poster?"
3,51,Lawrence,"Well, let's just say that the sightings have been enough evidence of UFOs. (leaves)"
3,51,Buford,His words confuse me.
3,51,Phineas,"Dad can be like that. But, nevertheless. I know what we're gonna do today: We're gonna solve the mystery of the Danville crop circles. Hey, where's Perry?"

I'm going to challenge the pizza man to a dough-spinning contest and humiliate him in front of tens of people! And why are you coming with me, you ask? (puts hat on) Well, this just completes the look."
3,51,Phineas,"In order to crack this case, we need to get a bird's-eye view of the situation."

3,51,Buford,So you say.
3,51,Baljeet,"Look, more crop circles! And they are exactly the same shape as the others!"
3,51,Phineas,Maybe they're trying to tell us something.
3,51,Baljeet,"That they like that shape, apparently!"
3,51,Phineas,Maybe... We'll have to search for more clues.

3,51,Random guy,"Oh, it was! They don't look human at all!"
3,51,Gutsofanemu,"No. No, they don't. Who are these invaders? What are they doing here? What is the meaning of these crop circles? Why can't I time my barbecue right? (in background) Either I'm waiting an hour when they're supposed to heat up, or they're already past their peak when I bring out the steaks."
3,51,Candace,"I gotta call Mom! They're gonna be so... Oh, no, they don't! I'm taking a me day!"
3,51,Pizza Guy,"(Italian accent) Hey, everybody, she got-a free pizza? (audience cheers) Hey, look-a what you see! It's a dough-osaur! Ha hey! The Leaning Tower of Pizza! Ay? Everyone having a good time?"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"No! No, we're not! We're having a rotten time, you stingy jerk!"
3,51,Pizza Guy,Why you-a callin' me these bad guy things?
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Because you cheated me! 37 minutes or free! That was the deal! And 38 minutes later, you welched on it!"
3,51,Pizza Guy,"But I would-a never! Wait-a one second! You are the guy who set up-a the traps to slow me down, yes?"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, I have traps, but th-they weren't necessarily for you, y'know, specifically, but... Look, enough of your excuses! I challenge you to a dough duel!"
3,51,Pizza Guy,"(using his dough as a grass skirt while doing the hula) A dough duel, eh? I accept-a your challenge! If you win, I give you-a free pizza for life! But if I win, you no order my pizza ever again!"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,Deal! I don't want your stupid pizza anyway. (Perry struggles to get out of the trap.) Don't bother! Chin strap!
3,51,Phineas,"Well, this is the last one."
3,51,Isabella,But we still don't know what it means.
3,51,Phineas,Maybe we need to get a fresh take on this. (to Baljeet) Bring up the crop circle map.
3,51,Phineas,That's it!
3,51,Baljeet,I do not see anything.
3,51,Phineas,Exactly! Because there's nothing to see! Right...there! That's the one spot where the aliens haven't been! I'll bet that's their next stop. Let's go!
3,51,Gutsofanemu,(on TV) The alien ship has been seen hovering over...
3,51,Spokeswoman,"(on TV) ...makeup tips, (Candace smiles) so you can look your best for the impending alien invasion."
3,51,Stacy,"(on phone) Candace, didja see the news? That is your brothers, right?"
3,51,Candace,"Yes, but I'm not busting them."
3,51,Stacy,"(on phone) Uh, hello? The ultimate bust just falls in your lap and you're not gonna jump at the chance? What's up with that?"
3,51,Candace,"Listen, Stacy!! Me day! No bust, no blow up in face!! FACE!!!"
3,51,Stacy,"(on phone) Well, now that you've put it crazy..."
3,51,Candace,Back to my stories. (hangs up) Takin' a me day.
3,51,(Song,"""Non Reaction Song"")"
3,51,Baljeet,"(to Buford) So, if you do not believe the flying saucer is real, why did you want to take a turn flying it?"
3,51,Buford,"Just confirmin' it's not real. Besides, I categorically deny I'm flyin' it."
3,51,Isabella,Look out!
3,51,Pizza Guy,A little early to be knockin' my pizza down. We haven't even-a started yet!
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"That wasn't me. You... W-Wait, where's my chef's hat?"
3,51,Pizza Guy,"You-a ready, fella?"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Nope. First, I'm gonna do a little pre-gloating. I'm goin' to wipe the floor with you. I'm goin' to make you scream for mercy and there will be none! Men will weep. Children will wail! Whales will wail! Like...like this... (Mimics whale song.) Like they do, except they'll be doing it on your behalf! And women will look away as you walk the hall of shame! (beat) Okay, now I'm ready."
3,51,Pizza Guy,"One-a, two-a, three-a...GO!"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no, no!"
3,51,Pizza Guy,(also getting sucked in) Hey! What's-a your deal?!
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"This is not at all what I had in mind! Oh! Oh, this really sucks! I mean, literally! Okay!"
3,51,Man,This is really uncomfortable.
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,Boy!
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,That failure was spectacular...even for me!
3,51,Pizza Guy,"You must be a lot of fun at the parties! (American accent) But, seriously, don't order my pizzas again, okay?"
3,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, deal. Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
3,51,Isabella,"(offscreen) Well, this is the spot."
3,51,Phineas,"Fan out, gang. Maybe we can find out why this is the only field in Danville with no crop circles."
3,51,Buford,"You're wastin' your time. There's nothin' here but grass. Grass and this...key! (He uses the key as a hair scratcher.) Ah. Oh, that's good."
3,51,Isabella,"Uh, Phineas?"
3,51,Phineas,It's the same shape as the crop circles.
3,51,Buford,And I suppose that makes it special?
3,51,Alien,"Thank you for returning our key. We left large signs in fields all over the Tri-State Area, but you are the only Earthlings that came to our aid."
3,51,Phineas,"Oh, no problem. Glad we could help."
3,51,Alien,"To return the favor, here is something you lost in 1977."
3,51,Phineas,Cool! The Voyager Space Probe!
3,51,Alien,Goodbye and good luck!
3,51,Isabella,So long!
3,51,Phineas,"Take it easy! Wow, that artist rendering on the news was really accurate!"
3,51,Buford,"Okay, there might be somethin' to this whole UFO thing."
3,51,Linda,"Candace, I got the pizza you ordered."
3,51,Candace,"Thanks, Mom."
3,51,Linda,I have time to do nice things when I'm not distracted by panicked phone calls.
3,51,Candace,"Oh, look! It's the boys in their UFO! And Mom is in the next room! (beat as Candace's eye twitches again) Nope! I've had a lovely day and I'm not gonna ruin it with another failed bust attempt. No way this day is gonna blow up in my— (She opens the box and the pizza explodes in her face and blocks the saucer from view.) Oh! So that's what they meant by ""exploding pizza""."
3,51,Linda,"It's all the rage with the foodies. Oh, there's Phineas and Ferb. Hi, boys! (She waves and the gang waves back.)"
3,51,Candace,"Yup, still there. (goes back to bed) I'm not sayin' a word."
3,45,Candace,"(to Stacy on the cell phone) Ok, Stace. I'm all set up. Nothing could get in between me and some good old fashioned vitamin D!"
3,45,Stacy,(on the cell phone) What about busting your brothers?
3,45,Candace,"Don't worry. I can do both! (grabs a pair of binoculars) I've got a perfect view of them from where I'm sitting. Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I'm all up in their grill and they don't have a clue!"
3,45,Phineas,"Hi, Candace."
3,45,Candace,"(screams) Hey, don't you know it's rude to sneak up on someone who is trying to spy on you?"
3,45,Phineas,Sorry.
3,45,Candace,What are you guys doing?
3,45,Phineas,"Well, you know how we do something new everyday?"
3,45,Candace,No!
3,45,Phineas,"Oh, well, we try to build some big project or do something..."
3,45,Candace,"I'm aware of the concept, Phineas. I was just being sarcastic."
3,45,Phineas,"Really? Hey, that was pretty good. Wow, I totally fell for it. (to Ferb) Ferb, I totally fell for it..."
3,45,Candace,Anyway...
3,45,Phineas,"Oh, right, anyway, Ferb and I decided that today, we're gonna let you pick what we're gonna do today!"
3,45,Candace,Let me get this straight. You are going to allow me to pick what you are gonna build today.
3,45,Phineas,"That's about the size of it, Candace."
3,45,Candace,"Size! That's it! It's got to be huge. No, wait, you built a skyscraper to the moon and who knows where that went. (the camera reveals the current location of the skyscraper) No, if this summer has taught me anything, it's not the size of the project that's important. What matters is proximity. Mom's proximity. (at herself) Think, Candace, think. This could be the most important decision of your entire summer. Something that will make Mom come and see what you are building. Hmm, what will that be? (gasps) A Mom Attractor!"
3,45,Phineas,"Cool! You mean, like, a big tractor mother with all its little baby tractors?"
3,45,Candace,"No, I mean, a Mom Attractor. A big contraption that will attract Mom so that she'll come home and see what you guys built."
3,45,Phineas,"Well, you heard the lady. (to Ferb) Ferb, she knows what we're gonna do today."
3,45,Candace,How can I help?
3,45,Phineas,"Well, we're gonna need a list of things that Mom likes."
3,45,Candace,"Oh, hey, Dad! You know Mom pretty well."
3,45,Lawrence,"Oh, yes. I'd like to think so, yes."
3,45,Candace,I'm trying to think of things that Mom likes.
3,45,Lawrence,"Oh, so many things, really. Music, hobbies, you kids. Ooh! You know what she really likes, is my famous rhubarb creme brulee. I used to make it for her all the time when we were dating. Oh, it made her so happy. (Candace leaves but Lawrence doesn't notice her leaving.) You know, I should get out my toque and blowtorch and make one for her today. What a good idea, Candace. Thank you. (notices Candace has left) Candace? Well, all right then."
3,45,Major Monogram,"Ah, there you are, Agent P. Well, let's get down to brass tacks or whatever it is tacks are made of these days. It seems that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the polyethylene in town. It's a substance apparently used in disposable baby diapers. It could be an evil scheme or it could just be neutral. Get out there and absorb the situation. Now, since your hovercraft is in the shop, Carl has had to arrange last minute alternative transportation for you."
3,45,Carl,"Yes. Hello, Agent P. So, yeah, go ahead and put on that fruit hat."
3,45,Lawrence,"(gets a blowtorch and activates it, releasing a huge blue flame.) Whoo!"
3,45,Doofenshmirtz,"♪ Gonna mallet, mallet, mallet in the morning. Mallet, mallet, mallet all day. ♪"
3,45,Doofenshmirtz,What is this? Some sort of Latin gorilla cha-cha gram? Hola.
3,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Ay caramba! Perry the cha-cha gram? I mean, Platy... Obviously, you're Perry the Platypus."
3,45,Doofenshmirtz,"And I was... Use the door! Yeah, that was, uh, hmm, not... Not, uh, good. Oh well. (pushes a button to trap Perry) There, that's better! I much prefer you trussed up in my happy Jump-inator! Which goes with the theme of my new scheme, the Baby-Cry-inator! I know what you're saying. ""But, Heinz, you've already done a baby-themed evil plot."" But this time, I've really nailed it. Let me explain."
3,45,Doofenshmirtz,"You remember my goody two-shoes brother, Roger, the mayor? It is a well-known fact that no politician can pass up kissing a baby for fear of alienating the electorate. This can be risky, though, because if the baby cries, you can alienate the electorate even worse than if you refuse to kiss the baby in the first place. This has never really been a problem for Roger, though, everybody loves Roger! Babies, voters, dogs, cats, guys with shovels, giant squid, you name it. But this little baby, and by ""little baby"", I mean enormous baby, is gonna change all of that! Today, when my brother is campaigning, every time he kisses a baby, I will uncork the Baby-Cry-inator, releasing such a wail that the voters will think he is universally hated by babies, and therefore, untrustworthy. I know it sounds complicated but I've thought this one through. Babies cry, everyone's unhappy, and I somehow take over. (a short pause) It's foolproof!"
3,45,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Check it out."
3,45,Candace,"Oh, my mom! That is so cool!"
3,45,Phineas,"Yep. The Attractor will extract the essence of things that Mom loves, and use it to attract Mom! (puts the following things inside an opening on the invention) Things like Mom's Love Händel albums, an assortment of her favorite chocolate and scented candles, and of course, Mom's lucky Viking helmet."
3,45,Candace,Why does she have one of those?
3,45,Ferb,Women are a mystery.
3,45,Candace,That's got to be one of the coolest things you've ever built.
3,45,Phineas,"Yes, yes, it is."
3,45,Candace,Let's try it out.
3,45,Candace,"Hey, uh, I don't hear anything!"
3,45,Phineas,That's 'cause you're not Mom.
3,45,Candace,"(Her cell phone rings.) Hi, Mom. What? You feel a sudden and inexplicable urge to come home? (to Phineas and Ferb) (gasps) It's working! It's functioning properly."

3,45,Candace,"Come on, come on! Yes! Mom's coming! (Linda is shown running towards the house.) I just wanna remember this moment. Relish it. Revel in it. Bask in the sunlight of pure, busting bliss! (Candace continues to hear the Baby-Cry-inator's wail and wonders where is it coming from.) What is all that racket?"
3,45,Candace,"Huh? Wait! Mom! (she runs back to the backyard) Phineas and Ferb, why is it not working?"
3,45,Phineas,"Oh, it's working, Candace. It's just that nothing attracts moms more than the sound of a baby crying!"
3,45,Mom Attractor,(in a robotic voice) Must soothe baby! (runs away from the house)

3,45,Linda,"Candace, let go!"
3,45,Candace,Mom! Phineas and Ferb made a Mom Attractor and it's in the backyard! (opens the door to the backyard) See?!
3,45,Linda,"Yes. (goes through gate) Yes, there is a Mom Attractor in the backyard."
3,45,Lawrence,"Hello, darling. Look, I made my famous rhubarb creme brulee. Mmm, eh?"
3,45,Linda,Don't mind if I do.
3,45,Candace,But -- they asked me to pick -- and I did -- and it worked -- and now -- it's gone! Where did it go? Where does it always go?!
3,45,Baby-Cry-inator,Mama.
3,45,Mom Attractor,There. There.
3,45,Linda,This is too cool! Whose idea was this?

3,53,Phineas,Anything Dad?
3,53,Lawrence,"Well, actually there is one thing you probably won't be able to find here. An 1807 Dorcham and Wesley Boot Scraper, only one of them was ever made, (dramatically) and it's been lost to the mists of time! Oh, if only I could find that, I'd be the envy of the entire antiquing community; especially Worthington Dubois, (he clenches his fists) my antiquing nemesis!"
3,53,Linda,You have an antiquing nemesis?

3,53,Lawrence,"I did, didn't I? Well, I suppose I get melodramatic when I start talking about antiques."
3,53,Phineas,"Well Ferb and I found this in that parchment booth. (Ferb takes out an old, worn out scroll)"
3,53,Lawrence,"(He examines the scroll) A Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper's map! But only three of them were ever made, (dramatically) and they were lost to the mists of- oh I'm doing it again."

3,53,Major Monogram,"Good morning Agent P. Look, here's the thing, I don't know what Doof is up to. I've been busy giving each of my friends personalized ring-tones. I have one for you."
3,53,Major Monogram,-and one for Carl.
3,53,Monogram,"I want to send out a ringtone for when I call my friends, (monotonously) but I don't have a theme song. Anyway, go stop Doofenshmirtz!"
3,53,Candace,"What an incredible waste of time. I mean, come on. Most of this stuff if you saw it on the sidewalk, you'd walk around– it. (She sees something) A Ducky Momo, first edition, green pupil variant, with a left handed pull cord! Heavenly light, angel chorus! I must have it. But I gotta play it cool."
3,53,Candace,"So, uh, yeah, a friend needs a paperweight for her, uh, desk, and mmm, this little trinket looks about the right size."
3,53,Flea market Salesman,"Please, little girl, this little trinket is a Ducky Momo, first edition, green pupil variant, with a left handed pull chord. There are only two of these in North America, they're more rare than Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper's Maps, but not quite rare as the Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper."
3,53,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, mists of time, whatever. What do you want for it?"
3,53,Salesman,You couldn't afford it.
3,53,Candace,Would you take something in trade?
3,53,Salesman,The one thing I want is the one thing I can't have. That. Early Twentieth Century Abyssinian baby rattle. But he won't sell it to me because of that silly French cabinet!

Well as you know, films sway public opinion better than any other medium. So I have produced a movie that will convince the people of the Tri-State Area, to make me their leader. Here's a clip."
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,(in the film) Make me your leader.
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"It can't miss! Anywho, I'm going to enter it in the Danville Film Festival today. There's only one small hitch, turns out it's Danville's Young Filmmakers Festival. You have to be less than fifteen years old, but no matter. Because, behold, my De-Age-inator. With this I'll turn myself into a fourteen year old boy, submit my film to the festival, and sit back as the people of Danville are convinced that I must be installed as the leader of the entire Tri-State Area!"
3,53,Candace,"Cigar box banjo. An old time diving suit. Fur lined telephone, be right back."
3,53,Lawrence,"Well the map has led us to Boot Scrapers Hall. (They enter Boot Scrapers Hall) Oh, the spirit of Danville, see how his sole gleams, the Boot Scapers took their craft seriously."
3,53,Phineas,"Hey, look there's a plaque. But what are these funny symbols?"
3,53,Lawrence,"(He gasps) By Harry! That's Boot Scrape! The secret language of the ancient boot scapers. (Reading) To gain the world, and halt the wintle, reverse your mind, and mind the lintel."
3,53,Phineas,The lintel?
3,53,Lawrence,It's the space between two columns. Look!
3,53,Phineas,Is that Greek?
3,53,Lawrence,"Well I know Greek, but I don't recognize some of these symbols."
3,53,Phineas,"Wait a minute, reverse your mind... Ferb."
3,53,Phineas,"(Reading) ""The disk of fate drops the boot."" The disk of fate?"
3,53,Lawrence,"Oh, it's that coat of arms right there."
3,53,Phineas,"The Statue! Guys look, the statue's boot is not resting on that podium. And that podium has a giant slot in it. (After he pulls off the coat of arms) Look, it a big penny. Ferb, pay the man."
3,53,Lawrence,Just like an old iron penny bank. Stand back boys.
3,53,Phineas,Wow.
3,53,Lawrence,"Yes, the Boot Scrapers were renowned for their elaborate spiral staircases. If that Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper still exists, we'll find it down here."
3,53,Man,"Not if I, Worthington Dubois, have anything to say about it. (He laughs, evilly)"
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, this seems to be unplugged. There. (The -inator fires hitting Perry's trap) Oops. Oh, the film melted into … oil. That doesn't make any sense, it's not a Melt-inator. It's a, Oh right. Film is made from some petroleum product, and it made it younger so, I goes it makes some sort of ridiculous sense. (Perry attacks Doofenshmirtz) One last setting and to the De-Age-inator, and it will be ready to fire. (The -inator fires)"
3,53,Younger Doofenshmirtz,"Cool, I'm fourteen years old. Ha, ha, I totally beat you, dude. Now all I got to do is take this DVD to the Film Festival, and then I'll, like, have a lot of power, and stuff. And I'll like– (Perry runs in front of Doofenshmirtz) No way, dude! You're not the boss of me."
3,53,Candace,What do you want for the 1965 Northern Llama Rancher's Association commemorative creamer?
3,53,Man,"I don't know, a buck?"
3,53,Candace,"(Exchanging the various items) Commemorative creamer, clear flugelhorn. Clear Flugelhorn for a baseball stein. Baseball stein for cyclops Santa."
3,53,Phineas,Cool. Inner temple.
3,53,Lawrence,"Okay, let's get a move on."
3,53,Phineas,Get down Dad!
3,53,Lawrence,Cobbler's mallets. Why did it have to be cobbler's mallets?
3,53,Phineas,That was close.
3,53,Lawrence,"Yes, the Boot Scrapers were master craft-"
3,53,Lawrence,"The Cavern of Secrets. This entire room was made from materials scraped off the boots of Danville Elders, who were highly creative engineers."
3,53,Candace,"(Continuing to trade the various items) Battleship hat. Coffee grinder pogo stick. Thankless letters home, evil angel suit."
3,53,Lawrence,"Oh, blimey."
3,53,Phineas,I had no idea there was such a wide variety historical of boot scrapers. Which one is it Dad?
3,53,Lawrence,"Well, that's the question isn't it. Only one of these can be the true Dorcham and Westley. And no doubt a wrong choice will trigger a nasty booby trap. Boot scrapers were famously vengeful people. This could take every ounce of antiquing knowledge that I possess."
3,53,Phineas,"You can do it, Dad!"
3,53,Dubois,"(Appearing suddenly, and grabbing the scraper Lawrence was reaching for) At last! A hedgehog, of course. This truly is the Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper of legend."
3,53,Lawrence,"But Worthington, there are no hedgehogs in America!"
3,53,Dubios,"What, oh well that's just– (He gets squished by a giant boot)"
3,53,Phineas,"Wow, he chose poorly."
3,53,Lawrence,"Well, seeing as the place is falling apart anyway. (He grabs all the remaining boot scrapers, and the three run out)"
3,53,Candace,(Still at it) Pink gorilla suit. Battle of Danville commemorative dentures. A cane with a cobra on it.
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Dude, chill, it's mine. I don't have to give it to you. (As they fight, Doofenshmirtz unlocks the rapid fire, and sends beams of de-aging from his roof) Hey! Quit it. You're pushing me, dude."
3,53,Salesman,"You actually got it! Let me see if I can find a box. (A ray from Doofenshmirtz's -inator hits the baby rattle) I don't seem to have a box, oh well. Wait a second! Where's the patina?! This is obviously brand new. It's not an antique. No trade!"
3,53,Candace,(To the sky) WHY‽
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) Dude, you just totally broke my -inator."
3,53,Lawrence,That was an ever closer one.
3,53,Dubois,"Not so fast, Fletcher. When I fell, I landed in the ruins of the Hall of the Sandal Scrapers. An order of scrapers far more ancient than your miserable boot scrapers. And with this (Dubois reveals a sandal scraper, and begins transforming onto a much larger ghost) I will become the most powerful antiques collector the world has ever seen."
3,53,Ferb,Perhaps next time we should buy new.
3,53,Dubois,Prepare to (He gets hit with a green beam) Oh no! My enemies from beyond space!
3,53,Phineas,"Hey look Ferb, it's Garbog. Hi Garbog!"
3,53,Phineas,"This is going to be good. Team Danville, assemble!"
3,53,Dubois,How dare you! (The fleet unloads upon him) My future wickedness!
3,53,Announcer,"And that was the winner of this years young filmmakers contest. let's have a hand for the directors, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher."
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, crud. Can somebody drive me home?"
3,53,Phineas,Thank you everyone. But we couldn't have done this on our own. We'd like to thank our dad Lawrence Fletcher for spending all afternoon making this movie with us.
3,53,Linda,(To Lawrence) I had no idea you were so good with special effects.
3,53,Lawrence,"Oh yeah, but it was mostly them."
3,53,Phineas,And we'd like to introduce the actor responsible our villain to life.
3,53,Dubois,"Don't you mean (He tears off the costume, revealing Buford and Baljeet)"
3,53,Buford and Baljeet,...actors?
3,53,Buford,'Cause there's two of us.
3,53,Phineas,Take a bow guys.
3,53,Baljeet,Why is there an orchestra pit in a movie theater?
3,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously, I need a ride."
3,53,Major Monogram,(Sing a scale) la la la la la la la ♪

3,53,Major Monogram,♪ He's Major... Monogram! ♪
3,53,Carl,"I like the big finish, sir."
3,53,Major Monogram,"I can do without the sarcasm, Carl."
3,47,Linda,"Candace, honey, I'm going out to a birthday party."
3,47,Candace,For who?
3,47,Linda,You know Vivian's aunt's sister's landlord's son?
3,47,Candace,Evan?
3,47,Linda,His son.
3,47,Candace,Dexter?
3,47,Linda,Yeah. It's his birthday.
3,47,Candace,Why do they even have parties for two-year-olds? It's not like they're going to remember anything.
3,47,Linda,"Baby parties aren't for the babies, Candace. They're for the moms."
3,47,Candace,The moms?
3,47,Linda,So they can feel rewarded for all the hard work they do.
3,47,Candace,"(scoffs) Toddlers are easy. They eat, they poop, they sleep. End of story."
3,47,Linda,"You're a laugh riot, Candace. (starts to leave) Think you can handle watching Phineas and Ferb today?"
3,47,Candace,Piece of cake.
3,47,Linda,Have fun.
3,47,Candace,Hmm. Time to be in charge.
3,47,Phineas,So what you're saying is that we should never cut the red wire first.
3,47,Candace,"Okay, you two, I'm in charge and I'm gonna lay down some rules!"
3,47,Phineas,"Okay, shoot."
3,47,Candace,"No leaving the yard, no amusement park rides, no robots, no rocket ships, (in background) no time chairs, no remote-controlled llamas, (onscreen) no first edition issuing of commemorative coins, no asking where Perry is, no astrological planetary alignments..."
3,47,Phineas,"(While Candace is talking) Ferb, are you getting all of this? (Ferb holds up a miniature tape recorder) Cool."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,Surprise! It's me! I've taken over the OWCA!
3,47,Major Monogram,"Oh, no, he hasn't, Agent P."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, spoilsport."
3,47,Major Monogram,"Doofenshmirtz claims to have given up evil. He even signed this ""I Give Up Evil"" affidavit to apply for work at the agency. And normally, we could have rejected him because he's not an animal, but it turns out he was adopted by ocelots, making him, in the eyes of law, an ocelot."
3,47,Major Monogram,"Sorry to do this to you, Agent P, but we're making Doofenshmirtz your responsibility during his probation period. Show him the ropes, and, uh, don't let him out of your sight."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"You're probably wondering why I suddenly decided to quit evil and become a good guy. Well you see, I'd just built an inator. I called it the Babe-inator! No, it's not what you think. It's purpose was to transform my brother, the Mayor, and all of his cronies into a bunch of crying babies. That way I could take City Hall like babies taking candy away from... whatever they take candy... Aw, you know what I mean. Anyway, the Babe-inator was ready to go, so I took aim at my brother's office and pressed the button, but it didn't work! It didn't work for, like, the hundredth time! My evil plan did not work! And I thought to myself, ""Maybe I'm just not good at being evil."" That's when I had my epiphany. From now on, I'm going to be a good guy! So, here I am!"
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, my own cubicle. (Agent Kitty joins him and Perry) How nice! I'm gonna put a poster, right here, with a kitten that says, ""Hang in there."" (Doofenshmirtz turns and sees Agent Kitty; chuckles awkwardly) No offense. It's not like I think that's all you guys do, or anything. (Agent Kitty walks off) Oh, great, now he's going to Human Resources."
3,47,Norm,Oopsies! Better plug this in!
3,47,Candace,And no invisible paint.
3,47,Candace,"Oh, my gosh. I don't know how you turned yourselves into babies, but that is sooo bustable! (Holds up her phone) Smile and say, ""Hi, Mom!"""
3,47,Candace,"Now, you two are so... (Gasps) Where did they go? (goes off-screen and Ferb comes on) Come back here! No, put the power drill down!"
3,47,Candace,You stay right...
3,47,Candace,"Ferb! No, get back here with my phone."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, would you look at that! Newton the Gnu is Agent Silent G. Whoo! I have to blog this. (Notices agents walking by with cups of coffee) Hmm, must be a coffee break. (Computer screen starts blinking saying ""security breach"" and he turns it off without looking)"
3,47,Candace,Find the picture and send.
3,47,Linda,"Oh, they used to be so cute."
3,47,Candace,"""Thanks for the old baby picture."" (Sighs) Ooh, wait! I need something with today's date on it. I could take a picture of them with one of those old-fashioned things. It's like a web page with... printed on paper... A newspaper! Ha-ha! (Runs around trying to get Ferb to hold the paper) Okay, stop and hold the paper. Ferb, sweetie? Okay, just stand here and... No! No, don't run away! Wait! Hold it! No, no, no, no. Get back here. How about if we just sit? Then hold the paper. (Ferb throws it) We don't... We... No, don't throw it. Wait! (Candace gives up on Ferb and goes to Phineas) Okay, just hold this. Stay."
3,47,Phineas,Gah! (Throws the paper)
3,47,Candace,"Phineas, no! No throwing. (Phineas crawls to her phone) We use our... (Phineas licks her phone) Ew! (Phineas throws it and it hits Candace) Ow! (Candace tries again on Ferb) Okay, hold this, Ferb. Now, I'll just... Where's my phone?"
3,47,Phineas,Gah! (Throws her phone into a bird bath)
3,47,Candace,"Okay, fine! Okay, if pictures won't work, I'll just take you to Mom myself! I know we have an old stroller around here somewhere. (Candace finds a stroller and straps in Phineas and Ferb and they fall asleep) That's it, go right to sleep. You'll be busted in just a little bit."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"So then, the duck says, ""got any grapes?"""
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh-oh, it looks like, uh, coffee break's over."
3,47,Major Monogram,"Enter. (Doofenshmirtz and Perry enter) Agent P, we have a situation."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,Is this about that grape joke? Who told on me? Was it the duck?!
3,47,Major Monogram,"That's not why I called you in. Get a look at this. This is Newton the Gnu. He was assigned to Dr. Diminutive, but it seems some bonehead blew his cover on the blogosphere."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,A ride-along? Sweet! I can wear my new fedora!
3,47,Major Monogram,"Get out of here! (Doofenshmirtz and Perry leave and Carl walks by with a mail cart) Carl, get in here! When you're done delivering the mail, I want you to wash and wax my car. You know, a little wax on, wax off? It'll teach you karate!"
3,47,Carl,"No, it won't."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"I am loving this! We're all like partners, now! Like Jack and Jill, or Alice and Wonderland! And with a super-cool vehicle!"
3,47,Major Monogram,Be careful out there... (looks at Carl) ...washing my car. Don't scratch it.
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, look at these buttons! What does this one do? (he pushes a button which launches a missile) Whoa! Oh, yeah, this is way cool!"
3,47,Major Monogram,DOOFENSHMIRTZ!
3,47,Candace,(chuckles) Wait till Mom sees you guys. (Baby Ferb starts crying) Shh!
3,47,Candace,"I didn't do anything! He's my brother, just a baby. They cry you know. (Now Baby Phineas start crying now he cried with him then puts Ferb back his stroller) I know! Toys! I buy you some toys; that's what makes babies stop crying! (pushes the stroller towards a store that coincidentally sells baby things) Oh, thank you. (the stroller gets stuck in the door) I'll just be a second, okay? Don't go anywhere. Stay!"
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"This apartment seems familiar. Hey, do you mind if I kick down the door? (he does so, proceeding to get his foot stuck)"
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"(opens door) Ugh, Doofenshmirtz?"
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,Awkward!
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,Why are you wearing a fedora?
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,I'm a good guy now! I believe you've met my partner?
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,(gasps) Perry the Platypus? Stay away from me!
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,(laughing) Fools! That was only my hologram!
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't worry. I've got your back, partner."
3,47,Dr Diminutive,(traps Doofenshmirtz and Perry) I trapped you in a particle bubble from my new Photon 2000 Particle Bubble-erator!
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, brother! 2000 was so 4,000 days ago!"
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"Perhaps you'd like to join your friend, Newton the Gnu in his decidedly ordinary acrylic prison. Can you believe it? I was having him over for a friendly dinner, when I read your blog telling me that Newton the Gnu is really Agent Silent G!"
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,I can't help it! I blog what I see!
3,47,Candace,I've got some baby stuff!
3,47,Candace,"Oh, my gosh! Get back here!"
3,47,Robber,"(coming out of store with bags of money) Suckers! (chuckles) Oh, my bike. (the police pull up) Oh, good, the cops are here! I can report this vandalism to the..."
3,47,Police,(pulls out a gun) Put your hands up!
3,47,Robber,"(he does so) Oh, that's right."
3,47,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, get back here!"
3,47,(Song,Here's Why It is Great to Be a Baby)
3,47,Phineas/Ferb,(cooing)
3,47,Candace,"Okay, playtime's over. We've got a party to get to."
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"Due to your request, Heinz, I've decide to let you all go. From 40 stories up."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Just for the record, that's not exactly what I meant."
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"Yeah, I know. (drops them off of building)"
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,(as he and Agents P & Silent G fall) What do you guys think? How am I doing so far?
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"Hey, give it back!"
3,47,Dr. Diminutive,"Uh-oh. Oh, poop."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Hang on, boys! I'm gonna bounce us back to headquarters! Yee-haw!"
3,47,Carl,"Sorry about your car, sir. (presents a hubcap to Major Monogram) This is all I could find. (gasps)"
3,47,Major Monogram,"Oh, this is just not working out!"
3,47,Candace,"Hey, Mom! I've found a couple of babies that you need to see!"
3,47,Ginger/Adyson,"Babies? Oh, let me help! We'll take good care of them!"
3,47,Candace,"Uh, what are you guys doing here?"
3,47,Isabella,We're helping Mom's aunt's sister's landlord son.
3,47,Linda,"Hi, Candace."
3,47,Candace,"Mom, I need to show you something."
3,47,Major Monogram,"It's humiliating! I'm stuck in this crummy, little cubicle while my office gets repaired! Anyway, Agent P, due to your quick action and decisive action, you were able to rescue Agent Silent G. Doofenshmirtz, you're fired."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,Is it because I blew up your car?
3,47,Major Monogram,"No, it's because I have a list of complaints from Human Resources."
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"So, it was the duck! (Looks at the duck. The dog and crocodile do the same)"
3,47,Major Monogram,Let's face it. You've done more damage inside the Agency than you ever did outside.
3,47,Doofenshmirtz,"So, what you're saying is that I'm good at being evil after all! (calls Norm) Norm, we're back in business! Dust off the inators! (hangs up) Later, chumps!"
3,47,Norm,I'll start with this one!
3,47,Candace,"Mom, these aren't babies that look like Phineas and Ferb. This is Phineas and Ferb."
3,47,Candace,"(talking loudly) Okay, I get it. Lesson learned. Toddlers aren't easy! The irony is not lost in me! Little help here? Ugh, this had better wear off before the next episode."
3,47,(Song,Here's Why It is Great to Be a Baby)
3,46,Candace,"I've got a feeling that today is the day. Even as we speak, my brothers are planning something dangerous, disguised as playing cards!"
3,46,Isabella,Well I'm out.
3,46,Phineas,Me too.
3,46,Buford,(Laughs) Losers.
3,46,Baljeet,"(enters the backyard) Sorry, I'm late."
3,46,Phineas,"That's okay. (at Ferb) Deal him in, Ferb."
3,46,Buford,Who came up with cards anyway?
3,46,Baljeet,They were invented by ancient Babylonian traders and merchants.
3,46,Ferb,"(while shuffling the cards) Actually, the Babylonians had defunct as a distinct culture for millennium prior to the introduction of playing cards in India."
3,46,Baljeet,(Gasps) That is right! Three months of summer vacation and I am losing my edge!
3,46,Buford,"Has it only been three months? 'Cause I've been adding up all of the things we built this summer, and we're way over 150!"
3,46,Baljeet,Oh! My brain is atrophied! It needs exercise!
3,46,Phineas,"Gang, I know what we're gonna do today!"
3,46,Buford,And Perry?
3,46,Phineas,Who knows?
3,46,Lawrence,"And here, we have a marvel 16th century wardrobe. We have one just like this when I was a schoolboy. And inside it was another land filled with magical woodland creatures."
3,46,Woman,Ohhh hohoho. You English and your fantasy worlds.
3,46,Lawrence,Ahahah. Can I show you some tables...
3,46,Major Monogram,"Hello Agent P, sorry about the trees they were leftovers from Christmas and we didn't have anywhere else to store 'em. Oh, and uh, also the air-conditioning system is on the fritz, so pardon all the frost. All over the Tri-State Area, keys are disappearing. Businesses can't open, the freeways have ground to a halt, citizens are locked out of their homes, and I, for one, would really like to get into the executive washroom. It's got a waterfall, you know you wave your hand to the water just sort of-... well it's...it's really cool. Stop Doofenshmirtz! Quickly!"
3,46,Baljeet,Look at this! (he shows a X-ray of a brain) This is my brain during the school year... (He then shows the other X-ray) And this is my brain now!
3,46,Isabella,They look just the same.
3,46,Baljeet,I know! But it took me three minutes to remember how to give my self a CAT scan! I am slipping!
3,46,Phineas,"Not to worry, Baljeet. We've done a bit of cerebro-stimulatory haberdashery since you left."
3,46,Baljeet,Huh?
3,46,Buford,"We made a hat for your brain, slowy. (at Isabella) Boy, he is slippin'."
3,46,Phineas,Try it on!
3,46,Baljeet,What does it do?
3,46,Phineas,Hold on. (Phineas then switch a control box) It stimulates your brain.
3,46,Baljeet,Oh my.
3,46,Candace,"(in her room) An electrical bike helmet? Lame! (she then lie down in bed then dials in her phone) Hey Stacy, you still wanna go to the pool?"
3,46,Phineas,"So Baljeet, how many sub-atomic particles do you suppose...are in that dandelion?"
3,46,Baljeet,(goes over to the dandelion and picks it) Hmm... (drawing on the fence) Two point seven-three-two times ten to the twenty-sixth power of particles. But I could not tell you the exact location of any of them because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
3,46,Phineas,Seems like it works.
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"♪ Bow, chicka, bow-wow! That's what my baby says! Mow-mow-mow! And a something something -- ♪"
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? You know, you could've waited till I put my pants on, that would've...least been polite. And do you know what we do to rude people around here? (presses remote, trapping Perry in a capsule) We put them in a water soluble capsule. Ha ha! And there's not enough platypus spit in the world to get you out of it. Yeah, hop this way, let me show you what I've been up to."
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Keys, keys, keys! Master keys, skeleton keys, latch keys, skate keys, I love keys! And you know, take it from me, (on the roof) once you've accidentally locked yourself in a milk can full of cockroaches for a couple of hours, you'll—you'll develop a real appreciation. But uh, collecting keys one at a time takes forever! That's why I've invented: THE KEY-FIND-INATOR! Or the Find-a-Key-inator! I -- I haven't quite figured out what I want to call it. Cool, huh? Soon, I will be able to open any door in the Tri-State Area, it's -- it's brilliant. Uh, but my key chain is enormous. And—and it weighs a ton and everyone can hear me coming. What I really need is one key that opens everything! The Key to the City! My pompous brother, the mayor, is always handing it out to some yokel of dubious qualifications. Well, today, it's going to be this yokel of dubious qualifications."
3,46,Phineas,"Wow, look at him go."
3,46,Isabella,He's like a new man!
3,46,Buford,"Ah, he still gets de-pansed one leg at a time."
3,46,Baljeet,"This is great! With my stimulated brain, I am dreaming up all sorts of super smart projects!"
3,46,Phineas,Great!
3,46,Isabella,Picked out a favorite?
3,46,Baljeet,"I have! You see, the greatest impediment to making astronomical observations, is our atmosphere. It is like looking through pea soup! So to make our terrestrial telescopes more effective, I am going to take all of the Earth"
3,46,Phineas,Uh...
3,46,Isabella,I don't...um...
3,46,Buford,Sounds... suffocatey.
3,46,Baljeet,"Aw, I will disintegrate that bridge when I come to it."
3,46,Isabella,"But Baljeet, if the atmosphere is gone --"
3,46,Baljeet,"And it is so simple! I can use an ion coupling device to attract each atmospheric molecule to the second greatest gravity source, which in this case, is the moon, and after the initial impact..."
3,46,Isabella,(At the camera) He is so hard-core!
3,46,Baljeet,...the particles will bounce up into lunar orbit! Blue skies on the moon! Imagine that!
3,46,Phineas,"Hey, Baljeet? Can I talk to you for a second?"
3,46,Baljeet,Of course! I will just use small words!
3,46,Phineas,"So...uh, we were hoping we could talk you out of transferring the Earth's atmosphere to the moon."
3,46,Baljeet,On the eve of my greatest triumph? (starts fidgeting)
3,46,Phineas,"Well, we were just thinking it would be sort of a hollow victory, you know, with everybody not being able to breathe anymore?"
3,46,Baljeet,(stops fidgeting) Science marches on!
3,46,Phineas,"Okay, thanks! Brain booster, in retrospect...not such a good idea."
3,46,Buford,"I think Brain Boy's had enough stimulation for one day. (tries to touch the control unit but gets shocked) Ow! Hey, that hurts!"
3,46,Baljeet,"Yes! Yes, it does! This way my work will not be interrupted by creatures who cannot possibly understand it! Like raccoons, or people, for instance."
3,46,Isabella,I was so looking forward to Junior High.
3,46,Phineas,We're going to have to get into that tower. Any ideas?
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, so the, uh, Key to the City ceremony's not starting for a while so, uh...we got some...Oh, you know, I-I just realized that I'm...I'm wearing a white lab coat and I'm leaning back against a black tire. That's... (sighs) I think I might have to go change."
3,46,Phineas,"(over monitor) Maybe we could each get a tool, and come at him from four different sides."
3,46,Isabella,(over monitor) Baljeet is way to smart to fall for a trick like that.
3,46,Baljeet,"Plot all you want, I have my eye on you! No one will be able to stop me from stripping away the Earth's atmosphere! Oh, the things I will be able to see!"
3,46,Phineas recording,"He was smart before, but now he's like a super genius!"
3,46,Isabella recording,"Maybe, we should try flattery to win him over."
3,46,Buford recording,"Or, how 'bout a bribe?"
3,46,Phineas recording,I don't think we could offer him anything that would satisfy his super intellect.
3,46,Isabella recording,"Yeah, he's so amazingly smart, now."
3,46,Phineas,"All right, gang. This is our change to attack the Atmospheric Device."
3,46,Isabella,He's bound to notice that.
3,46,Phineas,Exactly!
3,46,Buford,"This is just busy work, isn't it?"
3,46,Baljeet,"Jetpacks? I thought you were -- (picks up Isabella's decoy) Wood pulp effigies? Ha ha ha ha! Clever, but not clever enough!"
3,46,(Song,"""Big Brain"")"
3,46,Baljeet,Ha!
3,46,Baljeet,Huh?
3,46,Baljeet,"Aww! I got you in my tractor beam! (starts pushing buttons) Time to strip the atmosphere from our planet, and allow an unobstructed view of the cosmos!"
3,46,Candace,"Danville Pool, Here I..."
3,46,Candace,"(sternly) Hello, Mom?"
3,46,Linda,Uh-huh? Uh-huh. That would count as dangerous. But I can't go anywhere until I find my keys.
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow! Great mad scientist weather, isn't it, Perry the Platypus? It's so dramatic! Ooh, the ceremony should be starting now."
3,46,Roger,"And now, it is my pleasure to present the Key to the City to this great humanitarian and American."
3,46,Recipient,"Th-thank you, thank you. Um, you know, when I set out to reinvent the ball-peen hammer -- (inator ray hits the key) HEY!"
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"I've got it! I've got it! (at Perry) There, you see? I told you it was water solu -- (Perry's capsule melts and he punches him) OH!"
3,46,Baljeet,Only a few more seconds to my greatest triumph! I wonder what I will do tomorrow.
3,46,Phineas,"(over speaker) Attention, Baljeet! Prepare to surrender!"
3,46,Baljeet,Ha ha ha ha! Surrender to whom? You are frozen!
3,46,Phineas,(over speaker) Are we?
3,46,Baljeet,"That is not possible! Well, I mean, clearly, it is possible, but highly unlikely. Prepare to be --"
3,46,Buford,"SURPRISE! (pulls Baljeet's helmet off and sees his giant brain) OH! OH! Oh, that is SO GROSS! But it's kinda awesome."
3,46,Baljeet,Something is different. (at Buford) How did you get in here?
3,46,Phineas,We tunneled up through the base while you were busy with our jetpack decoys.
3,46,Baljeet,I do not understand.
3,46,Phineas,"Well, remember when we all made those life-sized stuffed models of ourselves this morning?"
3,46,Baljeet,No.
3,46,Ferb,It pays to show up on time.
3,46,Baljeet,I will get an alarm clock.
3,46,Electronic voice,Two minutes to atmospheric transfer.
3,46,Baljeet,Oh! It is too late! I do not understand the controls anymore!
3,46,Isabella,Didn't you build a fail-safe or something?
3,46,Baljeet,"YES! Of course! It is right here, and the key is right on that hook! (notices there isn't a key and gasps)"
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Here it comes! Here it comes! (gets the key) Ha ha! I got it! At last, I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, can open any door with this, the Key to the City—you know, I can't believe it's cartoonishly big. It's almost like it's not a real key, but just sort of, symbolic of a key. It's... (sees Perry) Hey, what are you doing?"
3,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, well, whatever, Perry the Platypus. (as Perry leaves) I got what I want! This giant, metal key that, when I think about it, is probably too big to fit into any of the keyholes that I would ever come across. Which makes me question the whole val -- (gets shocked by lightning)"
3,46,Linda,"Oh, I'll just call the -- (her keys land in her hand, followed by the man and woman behind her) Oh, for goodness sake! They were in my hand the whole time!"
3,46,Electronic,"Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four..."
3,46,Baljeet,AAAAAHHHHH! WHERE IS THE KEY?! WHERE IS IT?!
3,46,Isabella,Is this it?
3,46,Baljeet,Yes!!
3,46,Electronic voice,"...three, two, one."
3,46,Electronic voice,Atmospheric Transfer terminated.
3,46,Baljeet,(sighs)
3,46,Isabella,"We should do something about that helmet, huh?"
3,46,Buford,"No! No, you should not! (he is wearing the helmet) I used my now vastly superior intellect to build the world's largest wedgie machine!"
3,46,Baljeet,"Boy, you try to eliminate the atmosphere one time..."
3,46,Candace,Mom! Mom! Backyard!
3,46,Candace,(With her eyes closed) Look!
3,46,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
3,46,Buford,Something is...different.
3,46,Candace,(opens her eyes) But there was a -- monstrous building here just a second ago!
3,46,Linda,"Well, it pays to be on time. (at the kids) Who wants pie?"
3,46,Phineas,I know I do!
3,46,Buford/Isabella/Baljeet,"Oh, me!/Me, me, me!/Me, me, me!/Me!"
3,46,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
3,46,Candace,I'm going to get an alarm clock.
3,46,(Song,"""Big Brain"")"
3,52,Lawrence,Hello lads!
3,52,Phineas,Hi Dad!
3,52,Lawrence,What are you boys doing?
3,52,Phineas,I was just telling Buford about phone booths.
3,52,Buford,And I'm not buying it!
3,52,Lawrence,"Oh no Buford, they were real. They were tiny rooms where you could talk on the phone in private."
3,52,Phineas,Yeah! And you'd have to put coins in them to make calls.
3,52,Buford,You guys are blowing my mind!
3,52,Lawrence,Speaking of coins... What's this here? Behind your ear? (Reaches behind Phineas's ear.) It's a quarter!
3,52,Buford,How did you do that?
3,52,Lawrence,A magician never reveals his secrets. (Walks away)
3,52,Buford,Your dad's really great at tricks!
3,52,Phineas,"Not really, I just keep a bunch of quarters behind my ear 'cause he enjoys it so much. (Pulls a handful of quarters from behind his ear.)"
3,52,Buford,Wanna see what I got behind my ear? (Pulls a large ear from behind his ear.) It's another ear!
3,52,Baljeet,(Appearing from behind Buford.) Miiiindfliiip.
3,52,Phineas,What are you doing Baljeet?
3,52,Baljeet,I am Buford's hype man. Check him out! Miiiindfliiip.
3,52,Phineas,"That's great! You can be a hype man for all of us. Because I know what we're gonna do today. We're putting on a magic show! Hey, where's Ferb?"
3,52,Buford,"Ta-da! I switched my body for a dummy of myself, that Ferb climbed into when you looked away."
3,52,Baljeet,Miiiindfliiip!
3,52,Vanessa,(Glances back and notices Monty.) I know you. Didn't I see you flying off my dad's roof?
3,52,Monty,You're going to have to be more specific; I fly off so many roofs.
3,52,Vanessa,Really?
3,52,Monty,"Nah, just the one. Of course I remember you. You're Vanessa Doofenshmirtz."
3,52,Vanessa,And you're Monty Monogram.
3,52,Monty,That's right.
3,52,Vanessa,"Should we even be seen in the same room together? I mean, you know, our dads being sworn enemies and all?"
3,52,Cashier,What can I get for you two?
3,52,Vanessa and Monty,(At the same time): Cappuccino with chocolate powder on top and a ginger scone please. (Glance at each other)
3,52,Cashier,...and two straws no doubt.
3,52,Monty,"Okay, putting aside the fact that our fathers are sworn enemies, want to have those cappuccinos together?"
3,52,Vanessa,"Sure, sounds cool."
3,52,Major Monogram,"Morning Agent P. I guess we're getting a little bit of a late start. Our sources say that Doofenshmirtz is on his way to ""Steam Noir"", the hippest coffee house in town. We need you to get there before he arrives and stop him from doing anything, you know, nefarious. ...I've got a ""Word a Day"" calendar."
3,52,Candace,"Phineas, Ferb, what is this?"
3,52,Phineas,We're putting on a magic show. Do you want to be in it?
3,52,Candace,I'm calling Mom right now. (Pulls out her cell phone)
3,52,Phineas,Yeah Mom! She can be in it too.
3,52,Buford,A cell phone! Perfect! (Grabs Candace's phone)
3,52,Candace,Hey!
3,52,Buford,Watch this trick. (Covers the cell phone with a cloth and smashes it with a hammer) Voila! One cell phone transformed into miscellaneous electronic parts!
3,52,Baljeet,Miiiindfliiip!
3,52,Candace,"Okay, really amusing. Bring it back."
3,52,Buford,It's not that kind of trick.
3,52,Candace,Ughh! I can still use the landline.
3,52,Buford,The landline? That was my first trick! (Holds up broken landline phone pieces)
3,52,Monty,It's so awesome that we ran into each other. Can you imagine the look on both our dad's faces if they saw us here together?
3,52,Vanessa,(Laughs) I'm surprised your dad hasn't put some kind of a spy camera on you.
3,52,Monty,"You know, where's your dad's Date-Ruin-inator?"
3,52,Vanessa,(Laughs) So this is a date?
3,52,Monty,"Well, isn't it?"
3,52,Vanessa,Maybe.
3,52,Vanessa,Do you usually have coffee with your dad's sworn enemy's daughters?
3,52,Monty,"No, just girls whose roofs I've flown off of."
3,52,Vanessa,"Oh see, now I feel special."
3,52,Monty,Yeah I don't just fly off any roof you know.
3,52,Vanessa,Course not.
3,52,Monty,I've got standards. It's got to be a building shaped like a... like a...
3,52,Vanessa,An Easter Island head?
3,52,Monty,"Oh my gosh, exactly. What is that all about?"
3,52,Vanessa,"I have no idea. Hold that thought, this needs more milk."
3,52,Vanessa,"Perry? Is that you? Listen Perry, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't let my dad know that I'm here with the son of his sworn enemy. This is going pretty well and I wouldn't want him to spoil it. Can you help me? (Perry nods) Thanks Perry."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,Steam Noir! Vanessa says the coolest people in town hang out right here.
3,52,Monty,My dad thought I wanted to be an acrobat. I mean it was fun but it wasn't my thing.
3,52,Vanessa,My dad was the same way with... (Doofenshmirtz walks in front and Vanessa's voice fades out)
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah waiter, you mind if I tell you my evil scheme? My nemesis didn't show up today and I still have to get it out. I figured since I'm getting nowhere with the older Tri-State population, maybe I should go for the younger demographic. So, behold! The Cool-inator! Well, you can't really behold it, it's out in the car. But trust me, it's behold-worthy. First, I will suck all the cool out of this place, it being the hippest coffee house in town. Then, I will blast myself with the cool concentrate, transforming into such an ""awesome dude"" that you, disaffected youth, will have no choice but to follow me blindly and help me, you know, take over the Tri-State Area! Anyway, the Cool-inator is so hip that it only runs on espresso, so let's fill her up."
3,52,Cashier,(Takes out headphones) What'd you say dude?
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,...I need ten gallons of espresso.
3,52,Cashier,"We only serve it in this cup, man."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, really?"
3,52,Cashier,"It's espresso, man."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,Fine. Let's see... this is about a quarter cup... and there's two cups in a pint... that would make... I'll have nine-hundred ninety nine more of these please.
3,52,Cashier,"...There are six-hundred forty quarter cups in ten gallons, man."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,(Outside pouring a cup of espresso into the Cool-inator) This is gonna take a lot of trips.
3,52,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the Mindflip! For centuries, shaman conjured magic for their tribes, and countless magicians practice hocus pocus for their audiences."
3,52,Baljeet,It is a... Miiiindflip.
3,52,Phineas,"How do we do it? I'll tell you how, if you can keep a secret. It's. A. Trick!"
3,52,Monty,Carl's in the college right? He can program the most sophisticated satellite tracking computer in the world but every time I try to call my dad he cuts me off. Can't even work a landline.
3,52,Vanessa,"You think that's bad, every time I use the microwave, Norm starts involuntarily rapping."
3,52,(Song,Won't Keep Us Apart )
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Hit me again. Hey do you mind if I use your restroom? I mean, technically I haven't had any coffee here, but I've bought coffee here and I thought that would qualify. I had a lot of coffee earlier this morning... Heh, okay TMI, I get it."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,Is this...Waaaah!
3,52,Vanessa,"So I look up, and there he is in front of the whole school... (indistinct)... finally stepping on the other team's feet as he walks."
3,52,Monty,"Well at least he showed up. I mean, if I had a nickel for every time I got the ""Your father couldn't make it, he's working late."" call. But I guess that's really your dad's fault."
3,52,Vanessa,So... what exactly do you mean by that?
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"(screams as he skids on the way out of the bathroom, stopping at the counter, sighs) ... You're out of paper."
3,52,Phineas,"Through the power of enchantment, and a few nifty dance moves, Ferb and I have conjured the glittered demons and are ready to pull off..."
3,52,Candace,"Phineas, Ferb, you are so busted! What is this thing? Get me out of here!"
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,(Pouring the last cup into the Cool-inator) Finito!
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, heads up hipsters, get ready to lose your cool!"
3,52,Monty,Well what I meant is that my dad spends all his time dealing with your father's schemes.
3,52,Vanessa,"I'll have you know, my father is a misunderstood genius."
3,52,Monty,Genius? I have three words for you: Self. Destruct. Buttons.
3,52,Vanessa,"And yet, in spite of all that, there's my dad free to do it all over again the next day. Whoa, really effective bunch of spies you've got there major."
3,52,Monty,At least my dad's spy network isn't funded by monthly alimony checks.
3,52,Vanessa,"You do know that what he calls a ""spy network"" is actually just a petting zoo. With hats."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,Say goodbye to your street cred hip-cats! (turns on the Cool-inator)
3,52,Male Customer 1,"So I said to him, ""Step off my guest list, poser."" (gets zapped by the Cool-inator) You want to hear how my nose whistles?"
3,52,Male Customer 2,"Yeah man, you know, it's all about my blogs, you know. I blog about blogs that blog about other blogs. (gets zapped by the Cool-inator along with Female customer)"
3,52,Female customer,You want to hear a dream I had about my cat?
3,52,Male Customer 3,"Can I get some more local, organic water? (gets zapped by the Cool-inator) I can't drink any more ice tea, because when I drink ice tea I get craazyyyyy."
3,52,Candace,"Finally, daylight. Phineas and Ferb! (Linda and Lawrence's car pulls up in front of the house.) That's Mom's car! Mom! (Runs outside)"
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Now to set the -inator on ""reverse"" and blast myself with all of the cool!"
3,52,Candace,Phineas and Ferb built a really dangerous magic show in the backyard! You've gotta bust them!
3,52,Linda,Really Candace? Busting? That's so beginning of summer.
3,52,Lawrence,There's a Luciano Rigatoni festival at the art house.
3,52,Linda,Let's go.
3,52,Candace,But Rigatoni's work is passionless! With minimal importance! Every piece betrays its own lack of interest in the subject matter!
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, Perry the Platypus, this is very uncool of you."
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"A beanie propeller cap? Tha... (The propeller spins and Perry takes off) Uh... alright I'll give that to you, that's kind of cool."
3,52,Customers,"Are you cyber? Uh, want to do a sketch in my sketch book? Where'd you get that gnarly lab coat?"
3,52,Doofenshmirtz,"No! No! No you're nerds! Get away from me, I'm not like you! I'm... I'm cool! Or, I was going to be cool, when I shot myself with the -inator, which is now destroy... uh... curse you Perry the Platypus!"
3,52,Monty,"You know, our fathers are probably right, we shouldn't even be talking to each other."
3,52,Vanessa,This was a huge mistake.
3,52,Monty,Fine.
3,52,Vanessa,Fine.
3,52,Monty,...So wanna do this again?
3,52,Vanessa,(hands Monty her card) Call me.
3,52,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, in our grand finale, we make everything disappear!"
3,52,Audience,Ooooh!
3,52,Candace,Phineas?! Ferb?! (Sees Perry) Oh there you are Perry. (enters backyard) Where is it?! What happened?!
3,52,Audience member,All gone!
3,52,Candace,You two!
3,52,Phineas,Here's your phone. (Hands Candace her cell phone)
3,52,Candace,"It's totally fine! Okay, this may be an easy enough trick, but how did you make the whole show disappear?"
3,52,Ferb,A magician never reveals his secrets.
3,52,Candace,"That's a little cliché Ferb, don't you think?"
3,52,Baljeet,Miiiindfliiip!
3,56,Linda,"Mom, don't forget to water the plants. We'll be back before you know it."
3,56,Betty Jo,It's so exciting! I remember our trip to Africa.
3,56,Grandpa Clyde,That was Arkansas.
3,56,Betty Jo,"Oh, that's right, but you have fun in Africa."
3,56,Lawrence,"Ah, my university chummy has been trying to get us to visit his animal research station for years now."
3,56,Phineas,I bet Perry's looking forward to meeting all the wild animals.
3,56,Major Monogram,"Oh, there you are, Agent P. We've intercepted a text from Doofenshmirtz and we need you. I'm sorry, Agent P. You know we wouldn't do this if it weren't an emergency. I'm afraid you're going to have to miss your family vacation. Use Host Escape Diversion Technique B-17."
3,56,Phineas,"Hey! You okay, boy? Oh, no, I think he's sick."
3,56,Linda,"Oh, he doesn't sound well enough to travel, hon. Maybe we should leave him at home."
3,56,Man,"Sorry, kids, your Mom's right. The airline forbids transport of animals who are ill."
3,56,Phineas,Are you a pilot?
3,56,Man,"No, I'm a dentist. I just like wearing these hats."
3,56,Lawrence,"The dentist is right, boys. Your mother is right."
3,56,Phineas,"You know, if Perry can't go, then Ferb and I will stay home with him."
3,56,Betty Jo,"Don't be silly, sweetie. You enjoy your trip. Grandpa and I will take good care of him."
3,56,Airline Announcer,Flight 4311 now boarding.
3,56,Phineas,"...Well, okay. We're sure going to miss you, little fella. Feel better soon. Eat all your food and get plenty of rest. We'll see you in no time."
3,56,Candace,Hey.
3,56,Stacy,"Hey, world traveler! Ready to go?"
3,56,Candace,"No. Jeremy said he would see me off, but he's not here yet."
3,56,Stacy,"Oh, I'm sure he's got a perfectly good reason."
3,56,Candace,But he said he had something to tell me...
3,56,Airline Announcer,(In the background) Final call for Flight 4311!
3,56,Candace,...something important.
3,56,Airline announcer,Final call for Flight 4311!
3,56,Candace,"(Talking to an airline personnel, with a bull horn announcing the final call) I heard ya'."
3,56,Airline Personnel,Well!
3,56,Linda,I still can't believe you got dinner reservations at Chez Afrique. The travel guide says it's the top romantic destination restaurant. Five star service. Panoramic views....
3,56,Lawrence,"Well, I'm looking at the most amazing view right now."
3,56,Linda,"Oh, honey..."
3,56,Lawrence,"No, no, really. Look how many suitcases they have in that tiny truck."
3,56,Linda,"Ooh, that is amazing."
3,56,Buford,Move over.
3,56,Baljeet,But I got here first. Why should I sit in the middle seat...
3,56,Buford,There's your reason.
3,56,Baljeet,"You know, you can not solve every with your muscles. Sometimes you need brains."
3,56,Buford,"Yeah, like for dinner. Little bit of garlic, a little bit of butter, brains are delicious."
3,56,Phineas,"(sighs dejectedly) Perry would have loved sitting on the tarmac for no reason. (sighs again) And he would have loved this visual gag, too. (referring to Ferb wearing five neck pillows)"
3,56,Flight Attendant,(to Isabella) Couldn't help but notice your sash. I was a Fireside Girl myself. Enjoy your complimentary orange juice.
3,56,Isabella,Thanks. (to Buford and Baljeet) Gentlemen.
3,56,Baljeet,Networking is everything.
3,56,Isabella,"Did you know that African chapter of the Fireside Girls has its own special edition survival patches? (Listing some of the patches) ""Identifying fauna and flora."" Easy. ""Finding water."" Child's play. And, ""eating a grub""?"
3,56,Buford,"Little bit of garlic, a little bit a butter..."
3,56,Baljeet,"Do not worry, Isabella. You do not have to have every patch."
3,56,Isabella,I don't have to have every...! Do you even hear the words coming out of your mouth?
3,56,Candace,"(chuckles) Jeremy and I are cool. Stacy's right. I mean there's a good reason why he didn't show up. And he probably want's to tell me he wants us to... Start wearing matching sweaters or something cute like that. (chuckles) Yeah, yeah. (Her cellphone rings) It's him! Jeremy? Hello? Jeremy? You wanted to tell me somethin- Oh, we got cut off."
3,56,Flight Attendant,"Miss, we're taking off. Please hang up your phone."
3,56,Candace,But I need to call my boyfriend back. He has something important to tell me.
3,56,Flight Attendant,"Not until we land, I'm afraid."
3,56,Candace,How long is this flight?
3,56,Flight Attendant,Eighteen hours.
3,56,Candace,"Ugh, eighteen hours, with no phone."
3,56,Betty Jo,"Make sure he's nice and comfortable, Clyde. (Perry coughs and sneezes) What do you say when a platypus sneezes?"
3,56,Grandpa Clyde,I'll go check my monotreme manners book.
3,56,Betty Jo,You have a book on monotreme manners?
3,56,Grandpa Clyde,You don't know everything about me.
3,56,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. It turns out the text we intercepted from Doofenshmirtz didn't actually warrant you missing your family vacation. My bad. But in my defense, his text was written in all caps, but upon farther investigation, it looks as though he just hit the caps lock by mistake. Anyway, he's up to something. Go check it out."
3,56,Airport Announcer,Jambo and welcome to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. (The announcement continues to go on in Swahili)
3,56,Woman,"No, dear, our daughter's blond. Here she is!"
3,56,Daughter,Eighteen hours with no texting.
3,56,Phineas,(Referring to Candace) This one's ours.
3,56,Lawrence,"Welcome to Africa, Candace."
3,56,Operator,We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed.
3,56,Candace,"""Cannot be completed!"" What is that?"
3,56,Baljeet,Do you have an international calling card?
3,56,Candace,"Oh, no I don't. Give me yours."
3,56,Baljeet,I do not have one.
3,56,Buford,"I got a card. (He pulls out a stack of cards) Pick a card, any card."
3,56,Candace,Don't magic me. This is serious.
3,56,Buford,Who's magicin'? I'm just givin' away cards.
3,56,Baljeet,May I have one?
3,56,Buford,No.
3,56,Ignatius,Hairy Larry.
3,56,Lawrence,"Hello, old friend."
3,56,Ignatius,How are you?
3,56,Linda,Hairy Larry?
3,56,Lawrence,"Well, you know how there are no photographs of me between 1976 to 1979?"
3,56,Linda,Yeah.
3,56,Lawrence,"Well, there you are. (to Ignatius) Um, I'd like you to me my wife Linda, and our kids and their friends. Everyone, this is Ignatius Ukareamü, my old college chum."
3,56,Candace,"Hey, Iggy. How are ya'?"
3,56,Ignatius,"Well, hello, young lady, I have heard-"
3,56,Candace,So you got a phone at that research station of yours?
3,56,Linda,Candace...
3,56,Ignatius,"Ahh, teenagers are teenagers anywhere in the world."
3,56,Lawrence,"Of course, they have a phone, Candace. Africa isn't as primitive as you think."
3,56,Ignatius,"Your father's right. Now come on, the giraffe is waiting outside. ...I kid you."
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"(Speaking rapidly) Ah, Perry the Platypus! Come in, get trapped,... (A pair of mechanical arms grabs hold of Perry) ...listen to my back-story. When I was a child, I grew flabby, which made me want to make the Fitness-Equipment-Lock-inator. Bum bum bum. I just run on this treadmill, and out comes a sonic beam that locks every other piece of fitness equipment in the Tri-State Area. Blah, blah, blah. Everyone's fat and tired. I sprint into city hall and take over. (Perry easily pulls off the cuffs that were restraining him.) No! Perry the Platypus, don't do it. Don't push this self-destruct button. This one right here... (Doofenshmirtz presses the button, and the -inator blows up) Oopsie daisies! Pushed it myself. Grr. Boo. Hiss. That's right, I'm a loser. Alright, go on now, you won fair and square. (Perry leaves) Curse you, Perry the... and he's gone. Haha, I can't believe he fell for that decoy -inator. Norm?"
3,56,Norm,"Always a pleasure to see your sooty face, sir."
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha-ah-ha! Perry the Platypus is out of the picture. I'm Perry-free for the rest of the day. I'm sans-Perry. I am platypus-less. And now, because I still need to get it out of my system, behold! The Ultimate-Evil-inator! Isn't it ugly? You see Norm, it occurred to me that fighting underlings like Perry the Platypus is a waste of time. Why not go straight to the top? Why not take out the big boss?"
3,56,Norm,Major Monogram?
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,Why not choke off the wellspring from which all OWCA goodness-
3,56,Norm,Major Monogram?
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Let me just say it, will you? Ugh, you know, Perry the Platypus never interrupts me like this. Just saying. -From which all OWCA goodness flows, Major Monogram. There, see? See? You ruined it. You ruin everything. Just like I always say. Anyway, with this I'll blast Major Monogram, turning him evil! And then he'll, you know, join me as my sidekick. And give me access to the OWCA's vast computer network. Thus assuring my Tri-State Area domination. Every afternoon at this time, Major Monogram goes up to the OWCA's roof to sunbathe. (Doofenshmirtz fires the -inator, bouncing it off a satellite on a direct course for the OWCA headquarters.)"
3,56,Major Monogram,"Hey, Carl, does my uvula look unusually large to you? (He turns his mirror towards Carl. Just as the ray was to hit him, it bounces off, and hits Carl.)"
3,56,Carl,Meap.
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughing evilly) My neighbor's cat is totally shredding her drapes again. Too bad I can't see the OWCA from here. But it should be over by now. Pack up the -inators, Norm. Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated has a new headquarters!"
3,56,Norm,"Packing, sir."
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Remember, lift with your legs."
3,56,Ignatius,Welcome to the research station. (He helps the kids out of the truck)
3,56,Isabella,Thank you.
3,56,Phineas,"Hey, Mr. Ukareamü, what's over there?"

3,56,Ignatius,"We just need to refuel the truck, and we will be on our way."
3,56,Baljeet,"Uh, can you point me to the bathroom?"
3,56,Ignatius,"Young man, there is a bush over there with your name on it."
3,56,Baljeet,"My name? Really? How did it... Oh, you mean that figuratively."
3,56,Candace,Phone! Phone! Do you have a phone?
3,56,Worker,"Well, I do have one, but the cell towers are down for maintenance."
3,56,Candace,Ugh. (A monkey pretends to use a banana as a phone) Does that banana have international coverage?
3,56,Ignatius,"Alright, everyone, load up. We are going on a safari."

3,56,Phineas,That's beautiful. What's it mean?
3,56,Ignatius,Uncharted gorge.
3,56,Ferb,"Wow, they really nailed that name."
3,56,Ignatius,"In order to get down there, you would need a highly unconventional vehicle."
3,56,Phineas,"A highly unconventional vehicle? Ferb, I know what were going to do today."
3,56,Ignatius,"Alright, everyone, back on the truck."

3,56,Isabella,"Woo hoo, that was great."
3,56,Phineas,Thank you. That was great.
3,56,Ignatius,You are quite welcome. You folks relax and enjoy the camp. I have to muck out Kalama's pen. It is not all glamor.
3,56,Phineas,Mr. Ukareamü? Ferb and I were wondering if we could use some of your scrap metal to make a highly unconventional vehicle.
3,56,Ignatius,"Help yourselves, boys."
3,56,Phineas,Thanks.
3,56,Ignatius,Such imagination.
3,56,Lawrence,"Well, dear, it looks like everyone's found something to do, and Chez Afrique dinner reservation's in an hour."
3,56,Linda,I can't wait. I'm Chez Ah-freaking out.

3,56,Major Monogram,Doofenshmirtz? What are you doing here? Did you finally come here to surrender?
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, right, Francis. Wanna give me a hand with these boxes?"
3,56,Major Monogram,I! I will do no such thing.
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Feels good doesn't it? Being evil, huh?"
3,56,Major Monogram,What are you talking about? I'm good.
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Good and evil, wink wink."
3,56,Major Monogram,"Why are you winking? And you know you don't have to say ""wink"" when you wink."
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on, Francis, you've been zapped by my Ultimate-Evil-inator. I mean, if it didn't hit you, then who did it hit?"
3,56,Carl,"(He comes walking in stroking a skull in his hand) Looks like I got two for one. I'm going to take over the Tri-State Area, and with my administrators access to OWCA's supercomputer, and intimate knowledge of proper photocopying techniques, I'm just the unpaid stooge to do it."
3,56,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, you know what? I think maybe it hit him."
3,56,Major Monogram,Ya' think?

3,42,Meap,(looks back from the pilot's chair wearing the two piece mustache. He starts speaking in a southern accent) I beg your pardon for all the hustle and bustle kids. It's just that my planet needs your help!
3,42,Phineas,"We'd do anything for you, Meap."
3,42,Meap,"In a rather large nutshell, here's my problem: You see, where I come from cuteness is valued above all else... (There is a ripple dissolve into a flashback of Meap's planet) and the source of our planets cuteness is a very rare element called cutonium. And a very long time ago, back in the days of yore, a gentleman by the name of Zachariah Yore discovered a hidden underground vein of pure cutonium. Yore used this highly concentrated cutonium to turn himself into a being so dag-gum cute that no one could refuse him anything he desired. (Citizens of Meap's planet are taking jewelry and gold from what looks like a treasury and handing it over to Yore) But as we all know, absolute cuteness corrupts absolutely. (Yore turns evil) Yore quickly became a greedy, evil tyrant, who after a great war was eventually removed. Afterwards pure cutonium was deemed too dangerous, (The cutonium is extracted from Yore) and the last of it was gathered up in a special container, and blasted off the planet into deep space. However, a week ago, scientists discovered a long, long dormant trail of cuteness, leading away from our planet in the direction of Earth. (Via a telescope's point of view, a stream of purple matter is shown heading towards Earth. The flashback ends) Children, and Candace, I need your help. Someone else wants to lay his hands on the cutonium, and we have to find it first."
3,42,Phineas,No problem. Ferb and I can build another cute tracker with these parts. Of course this time we'll have to adjust the settings to ignore Meap's cuteness. (The camera pans right to Isabella frowning) Oh! And yours too Isabella.
3,42,Isabella,I don't need your charity. So how bad is this guy we're up against?
3,42,Meap,I think you're already acquainted with the scoundrel in question.
3,42,Mitch,"Ha, those kids will lead me right to it! Just as I planned! (The two robots give blank stares) What? Wh-what's that look? That was my plan. (The robots look at the destroyed pod walker) Yes, e-even destroying the pod walker was part of the plan! You know, I can deactivate the both of you, and two more just like you will take your place. (The androids clap nervously) That's better. Now let's get after those kids, before they get too far ahead of us. (Mitch's spaceship emerges out of the pod walker and he boards it)"
3,42,Phineas,I don't get it Meap. Did Big Mitch escape from prison?
3,42,Meap,"Well, we come from a cute based society. By law the harshest judicial sentence we can pass down is a time-out."
3,42,Phineas,Nice work Ferb. The cute-tracker 2.0 is up and running.
3,42,Candace,"So, where are we headed?"
3,42,Phineas,It says the cutonium is somewhere in... Seattle.
3,42,Isabella,How will we know when we get to Seattle?
3,42,Ferb,We're here.
3,42,Phineas,"According to this, the cutonium is buried somewhere around these abandoned coffee houses."
3,42,Isabella,"(Holding her sash) Well, it looks like the Unearthing Ancient Container patch I earned is finally going to come in handy."
3,42,Candace,"Great. Let's find us some cutonium. The sooner we get started, the sooner we get busted."
3,42,Candace,(to her phone) Look Mom. We're digging up the entire northwest United States! You okay with that?
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Seattle. My home away from home. And to think, Perry the Platypus has no idea. He's, he's completely clueless about my little excursions up here. Ha, ha. That poor, blind, trusting pla- (Doofenshmirtz puts down his paper and sees Perry outside in the rain, staring at him. He runs to the ""Dudes"" room, where he sneaks out of the window and grabs an umbrella. However, Perry is outside the window waiting for him) AH! I'm not here! You are not seeing me! (Doofenshmirtz begins to run away, but falls face-first into a ditch) Oh Perry the Platypus, how long have you been... and look at that, it's, it's Peter the Panda, my ex-nemesis, what a coincidence, huh? (Perry turns to Peter, and then looks back at Doofenshmirtz, annoyed) I mean what is he doing here, in Seattle... his... hometown? And look he's got, he's got two coffees, one of which for sure, is not for me... it's not mine... (He moves his hands upwards, and in the process knocks some loose dirt away from the side of the ditch, unearthing the container of cutonium) because mine's right here. Look. See? (He drinks the cutonium) Ugh, ugh, that is not coffee. (As soon as he drinks the cutonium, Doofenshmirtz shrinks and becomes cute. Peter drops the two coffee cups in shock. Doofenshmirtz soon realizes what has happened) That's just great. What kind of a world are we living in, where a guy can't down the contents of a mysterious urn found in a trench, without undergoing major physical transmogrification? Really?"
3,42,Mitch,"At last the cutonium is, oh- no empty!"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,Hey! Dude! You're standing on my lab coat!
3,42,Mitch,"(He picks Doofenshmirtz up) Oh-no, no, no, no! Did you actually drink the cutonium?"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, is that what that was? I totally cannot recommend it."
3,42,Mitch,"Well, you're cute alright, but you should have become completely irresistible. How homely were you before?"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,Hey I know you! You're that Mitch guy from space. Put me down you best friend stealer!
3,42,Mitch,"Well I suppose one container of cutonium is as good as any other. (to Doofenshmirtz, who is visibly annoyed) Want to go for a ride? Won't that be fun? Yes it will. (to his robots while pointing at Peter and Perry) Destroy them."
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,Wow! You're strict.
3,42,Phineas,(Looking at the cute-tracker 2.0) The cute signal's emanating from over there. And Big Mitch has it!
3,42,Meap,"My word! Something must be done, y'all!"
3,42,Mitch,Soon the whole world will be mine!
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,If you don't let me down I'l-
3,42,Isabella,"(looking at Doofenshmirtz) Oh, he's so cute!"
3,42,Phineas,"Yep, he's definitely the source of the signal."
3,42,Isabella,Let's get to the ship.
3,42,Candace,"(to her phone) Hi mom, check us out!"
3,42,Mitch,To the ship! (They enter the ship)
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,(as he falls from the pipe into Meap's ship) Woohoo! Whee!
3,42,Phineas,"(No longer wearing his raincoat) Gotcha! (to Meap) Come on, punch it Meap. Let's get out of here!"
3,42,Mitch,Oh no you don't!
3,42,Phineas,Mitch is gaining!
3,42,Mitch,I have you right where I want you.
3,42,Candace,"(to her phone) Hi Mom. Look, I'm in mortal danger! Say hi Ferb. (Ferb waves, and pulls Candace back into Meap's ship. A tractor beam emanating from Mitch's ship stops them from moving any further)"
3,42,Meap,"My word! A tractor beam! Hold on children, this ship is jumpin' like a June-bug on a hot chicken!"
3,42,Meap,"Well my little friend, it looks we're about to meet our untimely demise."
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, speak for yourself, I'm going to try to land on you, so you'll break my fall."
3,42,Meap,"My word, we've been fallin' for a long time!"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, a joke about the commercial break, yeah, that's how I want to spend my last few seconds."
3,42,Meap,"(He lands on the space needle, and loses his moustache in the process) Meap!"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"(He is still falling) Oh look, his mustache fell off, and, and I didn't think today could get any weirder!"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Nice try, but the mustache thing was still weirder."
3,42,Mitch,"I'll take that, thank you very much. (Mitch cackles as his ship flies off into space)"
3,42,Meap,"(The scene shifts back to Meap, who is still on the Space Needle) Meap!"
3,42,Phineas,"(They fly towards the needle with the hatch of their ship open, unaware of Meap on top of the Space Needle) Meap! We lost him. (They see Meap, who promptly gets into the ship) Hop in. Big Mitch grabbed the cutonium. (The hatch of the ship closes) Do you know where he's going?"
3,42,Meap,"Meap! (He looks at a glass panel which reads ""Backup Emergency Translation Mustache"". He breaks the panel, puts the mustache on, and starts speaking in an elderly English accent) He's heading back to my home planet. I must warn them! (speaking into a radio) Red Alert! Red Alert! Mitch has the cutonium, and he's on his way there. You must rally the troops, and head him off at the evil fortress. This is war!"
3,42,Female Meap Operator,Meap?
3,42,Meap,"Do pardon, forgot I have this silly thing on. (He takes off the mustache) Meap!"
3,42,Female Meap Operator,(gasping) Meap! (She hands her notes to the Head of Radio Operations. The scene shifts to a military command room)
3,42,Head of Radio Operations,Meap! (to the Secretary to the War Council) Meap!
3,42,Secretary to the War Council,Meap! (whispering to the Lieutenant General of the Meap Army) Meap.
3,42,Lieutenant General of the Meap Army,Meap! (He hits a red button sounding an alarm)
3,42,Alarm,Meap! Meap!
3,42,(Song,"""Wee Wee Wee"")"
3,42,Meap,There it is. My home world.
3,42,Isabella,"Meap! Your planet's so cute! Except, I guess, for that evil-looking fortress under that ominous cloud."
3,42,Meap,"Unfortunately, that's where we are going."
3,42,Candace,"So, uh, do we have a plan, or are we just going to go all willy-nilly, and barge into that bad, scary place?"
3,42,Phineas,"You know, willy-nilly barging is a plan, of sorts."
3,42,Mitch,Here we are. The extraction chamber.
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously? Y-you have an entire chamber reserved just for extracting things? That, that really comes up that often in your life? The extraction of things from other things."
3,42,Mitch,"Look, I don't have to justify my life choices to you."
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"You know you can drop the whole ""bad guy"" spiel. (Mitch's robots strap Doofenshmirtz onto a metal panel) I'm actually willingly going along with this, in case you hadn't noticed, but, yeah, okay, you're a bad dude, cool, whatever, I get it."
3,42,Mitch,"(laughing manically while holding blue orbs of fire) When the extraction is over, then you will see just how bad a dude I really a- (The blue fire starts to burn his left hand) AH! Put it out! Put it Out! Put it out! (One of his robots extinguishes the fire with a fire extinguisher) Okay, now that was... embarrassing. I, I'm going up to prepare the machine, while you two finish up here. Personally I hate the smell of extraction. (Mitch leaves)"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, what does it smell like?"
3,42,Isabella,"(She is putting on a pair of boots whilst talking to Meap, who is taking mirrors out of a box) Meap, why are you taking the mirrors?"
3,42,Meap,(He hands her a mirror) Better safe than sorry.
3,42,Isabella,Okay.
3,42,Candace,"(She is wearing a helmet) I don't know, Phineas. That door looks pretty solid. Are you going to try to hack the locking mechanism, or crack the code sequence?"
3,42,Phineas,"(He and Ferb are standing in front of a futuristic steel door equipped with high-tech visors and blasters) Yes, yes I am. I think the sequence is, (he pushes a red button with his blaster and the door promptly opens) push the big red button. (They enter the fortress)"
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"(Though he is still strapped to the metal panel, he has changed back into his usual form) Back to my old self. That, you know, that wasn't so bad. In fact I rather enjoyed large portions of that process. (Two robots load the container into a pneumatic tube, which sends it to an upper floor) Hmm, extraction. Who knew? (Peter the Panda and Perry the Platypus appear at the back of the metal panel) Peter the Panda! And Perry the Platypus! You're working together to rescue me? Oh that's really nice of you. (The two robots notice the agents and begin to advance towards Doofenshmirtz) Uh-oh. Hey guys? A little help here. (Peter and Perry pivot the metal panel upwards, which sends the robots crashing through the wall. More robots start to stream out of hatches in the walls of the chamber) This is some rescue. (Peter, Perry and Doofenshmirtz run away from the robots)"
3,42,Mitch,Yes! My machine is fully charged with cutonium.
3,42,Meap,"(He and the rest of the group are on a balcony overlooking the chamber) Hold it right there, Mitch."
3,42,Mitch,Meap! How did you get here?
3,42,Meap,With the help of Team Phineas. (He gestures to the rest of the group)
3,42,Candace,I never agreed to that name.
3,42,Mitch,"You're too late. (Mitch's head vanishes from the top of his suit. A few seconds later, he reappears at the left foot of his suit as a much smaller, ""Meap sized"" alien) Not even you can stop me from becoming the cutest being in the universe."
3,42,Phineas,I didn't know he could do that.
3,42,Meap,Neither did I.
3,42,Mitch,"(Mitch, who is standing on an elevated platform, is talking to his suit) Don't just stand there. Get them. (to the group) Boy are you going to get it now, when... (Mitch starts talking to his suit, which is finding it hard to reach the group) No! On your right! The ramp on your right! (Mitch's suit goes down the left ramp) Your other right! Yeah, when he eventually arrives up there you are in big trouble. In the meantime, behold the creation of the most adorable creature in the universe. Me!"
3,42,Meap,"Oh no! He's done it! Whatever you do, don't look upon him in that state. You'll become transfixed by his cuteness and he'll gain complete control over you."
3,42,Phineas,Awwwww...
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"I just realized something about myself; apparently I run faster than a panda bear, but not quite as fast as a platypus. Eh, who knew? You really do learn things about yourself in times of crisis. Wait, wait, turn left up here. That door must be the way out. (They reach a door, which opens to reveal Balloony in an armored suit. Baloony is holding energy axes) Balloony, it's you! Oh boy am I glad to see you. (The robots stop chasing them) Chill guys, Balloony and I go way back. So Balloony it's a good thin- (Balloony swings one of his energy axes at Doofenshmirtz) Well it's been nice catching up, but uh- RUN! (Doofenshmirtz and the agents run away) I think I misjudged his devotion!"
3,42,Meap Army,♪ We we we we (whee!)♪
3,42,Phineas,"Aww, look at the little guy. What's the fastest way I can transfer all my assets into his name?"
3,42,Candace,"(To her phone in a panicked tone) Mom, things look pretty bleak. We may not be back after all. Phineas is in a cute trance. Mitch turned himself really adorable and defeated the entire Meap Army. There's no one left to-"
3,42,Meap,"(He takes off his translation mustache) Meap! (Meap grabs a mirror and swings down to the platform to confront Mitch. Meap looks at Mitch through the mirror, so as not to become hypnotized. Then, just as Mitch fires a purple death ray, Meap closes his eyes and fires a rainbow death ray. The two rays meet in the middle)"
3,42,Phineas,"Aww, they're blasting away at each other with really cute death rays."
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Balloony, please help me. Balloony! Oh, don't let me go like I did with you. Balloony, what ever happened to us? (Suddenly, Balloony fights and wipes out nearly all of the robots attacking Doofenshmirtz) Balloony! I knew deep down inside you were still my best friend. Think of all the good times we can have, now that we- (One of the robots which survived Balloony's onslaught fires a laser, popping Balloony) Nooo! (Balloony collapses to his knees, falling into Doofenshmirtz's arms) No. Balloony. Stay with me, I- (Peter and Perry, who are now free, look at each other and approach Doofenshmirtz, who is holding a deflated Balloony) I'm not going to let you go a second time. Balloony! I can feel my heart... popping."
3,42,Isabella,"Oh no! Meap needs our help, Phineas, Phineas! (She drags him down) Come on Phineas, snap out of it! Phineas, Meap is down, he's been out-cuted. (She takes off her helmet and briefly swishes her hair from side to side) What are we gonna do? Phineas?"
3,42,Phineas,"Is-Isabella. Hey wait a minute, Isabella we've had a secret cute weapon all this time. You!"
3,42,Isabella,Me?
3,42,Phineas,"Don't you see? You can take him. He's only cute on the outside, but your cuteness goes right to your core."
3,42,Isabella,"So what you're saying is, you think I'm cute?"
3,42,Phineas,It's a scientific fact. (He picks up the Cute-tracker 2.0) I had to put an 8000-ohm resistor on the cute-tracker just to keep you from burning it out.
3,42,Isabella,(In a slightly annoyed tone) Close enough. I'm on it.
3,42,Phineas,"You can do it Isabella, just be yourself!"
3,42,Isabella,Hey Mitch.
3,42,Mitch,"Meap! (He gets thrown backwards towards a wall, discharging his cuteness in the process. He puts on the translation mustache) Ow."
3,42,Meap,"Children, you did it. You saved not only my planet, but the entire galaxy from Mitch's adorable yet evil plan. (Phineas and Ferb slide down onto the platform) On behalf of my people, I thank you."
3,42,Phineas,It was our pleasure Meap.
3,42,Candace,(She slides down onto the platform) And I've got it all right here on my phone.
3,42,Mitch,(He begins to run away) Meap.
3,42,Candace,"Hey! He's- Oh no! (She searches her pockets, but is forced to throw her phone towards the bay door. It hits a red button, falls to the floor, and breaks. The door slides downward, trapping Mitch as two Meap guards surround him) Oh no you don't!"
3,42,Mitch,(He sighs) Meap.
3,42,Meap,"Good work, Candace. He's going to get a serious time out now. Fifteen, sixteen minutes."
3,42,Phineas,"Well, it sure is great to be home.  (The scene shifts to Meap's ship parked in the backyard) Thanks for the ride Meap."
3,42,Meap,"Friends, I can never thank you enough for helping me save my planet."
3,42,Phineas,"Our pleasure. And I think we all learned a valuable lesson today, but we all know what it is so why waste our time restating it?"
3,42,Isabella,Bye Meap!
3,42,Meap,Farewell my friends!
3,42,Phineas,Bye!
3,42,Isabella,Goodbye! (Meap's ship takes off)
3,42,Phineas,Bye Meap!
3,42,Linda,"Candace, I thought I told you to take that garbage out. You are so busted, young lady."
3,42,Candace,Of...course I am.
3,42,Phineas,Hey! Where's Perry?
3,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus, I'm sorry there's nothing to foil, I, I'm still down about- (Perry holds up Balloony, who has been patched and fully blown up) Balloony! (An instrumental version of My Wettest Friend starts to play to a montage of Doofenshmirtz and Balloony spending time together)"
3,42,Narrator,"And now, a trailer for an episode we also have no plan to make."
3,42,Baljeet,Pay attention up there!
3,42,Candace,Jerry the Platypus?

3,42,Jeremy,"As a matter of fact, I object to this union."

3,43,Phineas,"We'll combine the zipperoo with the terror drop, and move clown town after the Ferris wheel, and we end the whole ride with a house of mirrors bouncy castle. It's great! A city-wide amusement park on a single track. And you only have to wait in line once!"
3,43,Paul,Delivery!
3,43,Phineas,Hi Paul!
3,43,Paul,"Hey boys, you ordered 20 tons of building material?"
3,43,Phineas,We sure did!
3,43,Paul,"Okay, sign here. Hmm, thought i had a pen here somewhere..."
3,43,Phineas,"No problem, I'll just use the pen you left here yesterday. (signs form) Ferb and I modified it so you won't lose it again."
3,43,Paul,"Huh. What did you guys do, install a homing sensor?"
3,43,Ferb,"Actually, we just put a clip on it."
3,43,Paul,"Cool! Haha, here's your form."
3,43,Paul,"Hi, dad. Yes, I just delivered to Phineas and Ferb. Yes. Yes, they are. No, I left them the blue copy."
3,43,Paul's Dad,"No, son. You always have to leave them the pink copy. The blue copy's yours. You gotta take your job more seriously. Now you're running seven seconds behind!"
3,43,Paul,"Dad, I'm not sure if I really wanna be a delivery guy."
3,43,Paul's Dad,Of course you wanna be a delivery guy. You just don't wanna be a delivery guy who's seven seconds behind. Step it up!
3,43,Paul,"Alright, Dad. Talk to you later, bye. (hangs up phone; turns on radio)"
3,43,Radio DJ,"Hey hey, listeners, the WJOP's party van is out there somewhere in the Tri-State Area. The first lucky listener who spot the party van and say the Phrase that Pays, wins a special prize!"

3,43,Paul,What a weird looking building. (goes into Evil Incorporated to find that the elevator has broken down) Out of order? Great! (struggles up the many flights of stairs) (knocks)
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,(from inside) It's open~.
3,43,Paul,"(goes in with the package) Helloo. Delivery. (a cage falls from above, trapping him in a platypus-sized cage)"
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, you're not Perry the Platyp- Oh, sorry about that. (retracts the trap) I was expecting someone else."
3,43,Paul,No problem. Happens to me all the time.
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,Really? (signs the form)
3,43,Paul,I'm just kidding.
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,Aaa-ah. Hey nice clip.
3,43,Paul,"Thanks. Hey, I like your place. What do you do here?"
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you know, different things, but today I'm building a Juice-inator (shows Paul the Inator) It's going to turn City Hall into juice!"
3,43,Paul,"Oho, is it now?"
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, then I'm gonna take over the Tri-State Area! You know, like you too."
3,43,Paul,"Well, at least you got a plan. I haven't figured out what I'm wanna do with my life."
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't sell yourself short, perhaps you can be one of my minions! Not an indoor minion, but a minion that keep the coalfires burning."
3,43,Paul,"Yeah, I'm not sure that's a step up. Here you go (hands blue copy then leaves)"
3,43,Doofenshmirtz,"You should think about that offer! Miniony! It's a growth industry. (looks at the blue copy in his hand) Oh, he forgot to leave me the pink copy."
3,43,Paul,"(as he gets inside his truck) Juice City Hall, what a character."

3,57,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, ah... I really am clueless."
3,57,Carl,About the -inator or just in general?
3,57,Doofenshmirtz,I'm not sure I understand the question.
3,57,Carl,Bah! I'll have to untangle this mess myself. The heat signature is wrong on the Disintegrat-inator. The angle is too obtuse for the Derezz-inator. The Julienn-inator isn't plugged in. And the Overhang-inator is just plain dumb.
3,57,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, sure, until you wanna hang under something. Then what are you going to do, smart guy?"

3,57,Candace,"He broke up with me! Of course he broke up with me. I mean, look at me. I'm a bundle of unbridled neuroses! I'm in Africa, surrounded by natural wonders, and all I can think about is finding a cell phone. (falling from tree) I'd break up with me too! Even the tree broke up with me!

3,57,Buford,I don't get it. How were you able to hold me up?
3,57,Baljeet,I tied your vine to my own. But how did you fall in slow motion?

3,57,Carl,"Why, hello, Agent P. Just wanted to catch up a bit. We never get any time to talk! In fact, we should totally get together in person. Considering that you're in such a lovely region with one-of-a-kind flowers..."
3,57,Carl,"(Still at the Flynn-Fletcher house) Let's see, red petals, three golden pistils... Dendrobium uncharticum. Presumed to exist only in uncharted regions in... Africa? I was sure he was struck by the Go Home-inator. We didn't even have a Go to Africa-inator. No matter; soon his tiny hand print will be mine, and then the OWCA will be mine, and then the Tri-State Area will be mine, and then I'm totally getting extra credit."

3,57,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no way, José! With Perry the Platypus out of the way, I can finally take over the Tri-State Area!"
3,57,Major Monogram,Not if Carl takes it over first.
3,57,Major Monogram,Let it sink in. ...Two...Three...
3,57,Major Monogram,"Atta boy, now come on over here and let me out. We have to follow him."
3,57,Doofenshmirtz,But how? He took your jet!
3,57,Major Monogram,"Oh, did he?"
3,57,Major Monogram,"Carl always changes my radio station when we fly together, so I had this jet build just for me. That's, uh, partly why are budget is so tight now. We can track through the on board G.P.S. Now, come on, let's go. We've got a world to save. (He puts on a pair of sunglasses)"
3,57,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. How did you get the sunglasses to go on one side of your face? Who made these, M.C. Escher?"

3,57,Ferb,"Well, ever since George Shaw wrote the first description of the platypus for highly skeptical European scientists in 1798, this unique creature has become synonymous with the word ""impossible."""
3,57,Phineas,"You know, Ferb's right."
3,57,"Isabella, Buford and Baljeet",Yeah.
3,57,Candace,Really? You're all satisfied with that answer?
3,57,Lawrence,"Alright, well, we're turning in."
3,57,Buford,"Yeah, me too."

3,57,Candace,"Seriously, a platypus crosses the Atlantic Ocean, finds you on the vast continent of Africa and no one feels this is worthy of a longer discussion?"

3,41,Linda,I'll be berry interested to see what you find.

I mean, we had to mail this last Tuesday. Plus, it's really just dumb-lucked that no one has picked up the mail first. Well, whatever. Open the box, Agent P."
3,41,Major Monogram,"That's right, rockenhosen! We're sending you to Drusselstein. Doofenshmirtz will arrive there this morning, and we must know what he's up to. Now this letter will self-destruct. (The envelope closes, and the letter self destructs) Oww!! Oh, and the, uh, box, as well. (Perry picks up the scattered shreds of the blown up letter, puts it into the box, closes it and tosses the box out of the pet door) 5, 4, 3...

3,41,Phineas,"Well, gravity proba-- Wait, when did you learn trebuchet mechanics?"
3,41,Isabella,Medieval Siege Engine Patch. It was my first one.
3,41,Candace,(Clears throat) I'm looking for a book on scientific investigation and disappearing objects. Got anything?
3,41,Librarian,"Let's see... (Starts typing on the computer) Um, Disappearing Objects and Scientific Investigation. Sound good?"
3,41,Candace,Shuh!

3,41,Isabella,"You know, traditionally, these things don't have much range."

3,41,Phineas,Hmm! Rustic! (notices Zengle's Fruit Stand) Here it is! This may be the only place in the world to get doonkelberries right now.
3,41,Zengle,"That's because I have my own doonkelberry field. So when I need more, I pick more."
3,41,Phineas,But what about exports?
3,41,Zengle,Well...the canning facilities shut down after the shaft stopped working.
3,41,Phineas,The shaft?
3,41,Zengle,"All of Drusselstein runs off of central shaft. Or at least...it used to. Drusselstein's a long narrow land, the only country in the world where a central shaft makes any sense, except for maybe Chile. At the end of the shaft was an exercise wheel powered by thousands of rabbits. The rabbits turned the wheel, the wheel turned the shaft, and the shaft turned everything else. A miracle of 16th Century science, today! It powered our vashing machines, our blenders, our schwingel presses, and of course, it ran all of the country's doonkelberry processing plants. The rabbits wouldn't keep up, so we decided to upgrade from rabbits to a more powerful source of energy: goats. So we set up a differential on each side of the shaft, that the goats might valk upon the ground. But, the Leftsiders sent their goats walking clockwise, and the Rightsiders sent their goats walking counterclockwise. So the shaft couldn't turn."
3,41,Phineas,But the solution is so obvious!
3,41,Isabella,Just have one side turn their goats around.
3,41,Zengle,"Yes, but we are a proud people. In our culture, turning your goats around is the mark of a coward! Neither side will back down. So it is, such as it has ever been, in Drusselstein, Land...of...the Shaft! I am done, now."
3,41,Zengle,Uh-oh. Time for the 5 o'clock demonstrations.
3,41,Man 1,Counterclockwise forever!

3,54,Isabella,"You know, Buford's kind of right. These smoothies are sort of exotic, but I think we can do better. What do you think, Phineas?"
3,54,Phineas,"What do I think? (Ferb tries to talk, but is halted by Phineas) Don't answer that. Guys, I know what we're going to do today! I wonder what kind of smoothie Perry would like?"
3,54,Major Monogram,"Come in. Sit down, Agent P. We have a serious problem. It seems that someone, and I'm not saying who, someone has spilled on the couch in the lobby."
3,54,Carl,"Sir, I.."
3,54,Major Monogram,A very expensive couch when we bought it in 1985.
3,54,Carl,"Sir, all I did was turn the cushion over. The stain was already..."
3,54,Major Monogram,If the responsible party is present...
3,54,Carl,"Sir, it was Agent M. He spilled a latte in 1990."
3,54,Major Monogram,Ugh. We were hoping to get him here a couple of years out of that couch...
3,54,Carl,Anywho?
3,54,Major Monogram,"Anywho, our surveillance operatives have been getting some mixed signals from Doofenshmirtz. He was observed at the Danville Library, checking out books on Eastern Australia and hydrostatic cell fusion. We haven't come up with any ideas about what he's up to..."
3,54,Carl,"Maybe he's trying to recreate Pangaea, sir"
3,54,Major Monogram,"Like I said, we haven't come up with anything yet. So, we need you to get in there, and find out. Good luck, and be careful out there"
3,54,Phineas,"Okay, everyone! Ferb and I developed a device that can literally turn any solid into liquid, so we can enjoy all sorts of new and unusual flavors. Isabella?"
3,54,Isabella,Abracapocus!
3,54,Phineas,Wow! That was really impressive!
3,54,Isabella,I just got my magic patch. Let's try this again.
3,54,Phineas,"Behold! The state of the matter transfer device! All right, Buford, is that chicken ready?"
3,54,Buford,All set.
3,54,Isabella,I got ya! There you are. Liquid poultry.
3,54,Buford,(drinks it) Mmm. Tastes like chicken.
3,54,Phineas,I think we need to try something a little more.
3,54,Ferb,Foul?
3,54,Phineas,Yeah! No! Exotic!
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, hello, Perry the Platypus! Over here. No, here. Look a-- Look a little more this way. (Poorly imitates Perry's chatter) What do you think? Huh? I've joined you in the genus Ornithorhynchus. That's right, I am a platypus! (Evil laughter) Yeah, hang on. Let me turn off the dramatic lighting. How did this come to be? I'll tell you, since you didn't ask. After years of being bested by your battles, I decided to fight fire with fire, and in both cases, fire means platypus, and with just means with. It was simple; the best way to beat a platypus was to become a platypus. That way, our skills would be evenly matched. So, after a couple of hours of promising experiments and some intricate designs, I finally created the Platyp-inator! Pretty cool, huh? Now, before I defeat you, I think I should further level the playing field. There, now I'm trapped, too. And go! You're not struggling, I said go. We should both be-- (Perry joins in) Yeah, like that. Okay."
3,54,Phineas,"Isabella, you wanna go next?"
3,54,Isabella,"Why, yes. How about a romantic dinner for two? (Ferb zaps the romantic dinner ) Wanna sip, Phineas?"
3,54,Phineas,"Oh, no, thanks."
3,54,Isabella,"Oh, okay. I understand. You know, you want to keep yourself open to other drink options. I get it."
3,54,Phineas,"Actually, I didn't want to say anything in front of anybody, but, it's, I don't like zucchini."
3,54,Isabella,Oh.
3,54,Candace,"And that is why we wear white shoes after Labor Day. And I.. (Sees Phineas and Ferb's invention) Oh, I knew it. Phineas and Ferb. Not very impressive, but suspicious. Stacy, I.. I got to go. Oh, and Happy Birthday! Mom! Mom! Mom!"
3,54,Linda,"Oh, laundry. Sometimes, I feel like our first president, because I'm washing a ton. (laughs) Ah, yeah."
3,54,Candace,Mom! Mom! Mom! You have to come out to the backyard!
3,54,Linda,"Oh, hey, Candace. I feel like our first president..."
3,54,Candace,"No time for the stand-up routine, Mom. You've gotta come out to the backyard."
3,54,Linda,"Okay, I'll be right out."
3,54,Candace,HURRY!
3,54,(Song,"""A Platypus Fight"")"
3,54,Candace,What is this thing? Some sort of souped-up techno-geek camera? I wonder what it... (Candace zaps herself to liquid) Phineas and Ferb! (A bird bathes in Candace's liquid) No! Get off! Ew! (gargles)
3,54,Linda,"Well that's funny. I could've sworn she said backyard. Oh well. If anyone needs me, I'll be washing a ton. (laughs)"
3,54,Phineas,"Let's see, we've got horseradish, durians, and turmeric."
3,54,Isabella,I've got a mountain yam.
3,54,Baljeet,I cannot wait to taste liquified sea salt.
3,54,Candace,"Hey! Watch where you're steering those sneakers, bub!"
3,54,Phineas,Candace? You're a smoothie?
3,54,Candace,"(Multiple Candace puddles) Phineas, you've got to fix this!"
3,54,Phineas,"That is so cool! Uh, what does it feel like?"
3,54,Candace,It feels like you're in big trouble!
3,54,Phineas,"Ferb, we're gonna need some sponges and a bucket!"
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Phew! This whole evenly matched thing is exhausting. How about we take a short break? Do you ever get tired of lugging this big tail around? I mean, sure, it's great for fighting, but it's weird for sitting and stuff. I just figure I'd ask you because you know, you would know. Uh, sugar or agave syrup? (Perry points to agave syrup) Here. I don't know if this is fur or really tiny feathers. I can't tell. It's so warm, but it breathes. Well, back at it, I guess. (Both resume fighting)"
3,54,Phineas,"Okay, these are the last drops of her."
3,54,Candace,(Inside the bucket) Hurry up and change me before that bird comes back.
3,54,Phineas,"Sure thing, Candace. We reversed the polarity, and it should do the trick. Now, try not to ripple. (Zaps the bucket)"
3,54,Candace,This does not feel like the reverse of being a bucket of water.
3,54,Phineas,"Hmm, so it would seem."
3,54,Buford,"I don't know, I kinda like her like that. She looks like Cand-berry sauce."
3,54,Phineas,We gotta get her back into the right shape before we solidify her. And we're gonna need to adjust the contour in.. (Phineas laughs and sighs) Cand-berry sauce.
3,54,Phineas,"Hang in there, Candace. This mold that Buford brought over should help us put her back together."
3,54,Baljeet,Tell me again why you have a life-sized mold of Candace.
3,54,Buford,I got life-sized molds of all my friends.
3,54,Isabella,I'm not so sure how I feel about that.
3,54,Phineas,"All set, Candace! Now wait right there."
3,54,Candace,"(Sarcastically) Ha-ha, very funny."
3,54,Phineas,"Okay, here we go! (Zaps Candace) Candace, come on out!"
3,54,Candace,"(gasps) I'm me! Glorious me! You did it! You guys are soooooooooooooo... (notices Linda, inhales) ooooooo... busted!"
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, Perry the Platypus, this isn't working. I need to become something stronger than a platypus. Let's see, what's-- what's stronger than a platypus? (Gasps) Two platypuses, that's it! I've got just the thing right over here. (Runs to the roof to pull out a sheet covering the -inator to reveal it) Behold! My Double-inator!"
3,54,Linda,"There, nice and clean. Ha! Now we're both a couple of good-looking dishes. Bah-da-da-duh-duh! Thank You! I'll be here all..."
3,54,Candace,Mom! Mom! Mom!
3,54,Linda,"Candace, watch this. I was just looking at this plate, and I said, ""There, nice and..."""
3,54,Candace,Not right now! (Candace grabs her mom's hand and drags her to the backyard)
3,54,Linda,"Candace, my hands are wet."
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"I'll just shoot myself with this baby, and then I will have the advantage because there will be two of me.. (Perry attacks Doofapus, which sets off the Double-inator, hitting Phineas and Ferb's invention, making it liquify)"
3,54,Phineas,Anyone else see that?
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Wonder what that hit. Whatever that is, there's two of them now. Soon there's gonna be two of me, and then nothing can defeat me! Except maybe a bigger platypus made out of metal. Yeah, like that. (grunts) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Even though I'm also a platypus at this point, and, uh... I hope this wears off soon. The novelty has worn thin."
3,54,Candace,"Come on, come on, come on!"
3,54,Phineas,"Oh, hi, Mom!"
3,54,Candace,"I'm sorry Mom, but you've got to see this. Feast your eyes on... (looks and noticed the machine disappeared. Her mood changes) ...puddles."
3,54,Linda,"Yeah, I saw 'em earlier."
3,54,Candace,"But, Mom, they had a machine that would turn things into smoothies, and..."
3,54,Linda,"I didn't see it, Candace. (Walks Candace with her)"
3,54,Candace,"And Buford had a mold, of me!"
3,54,Linda,"(taking Candace inside) Buford's got molds of all of us, Candace."
3,54,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry!"
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, well. I guess at least I'm back to normal."
3,54,Doofenshmirtz's clone,"Me, too!"
3,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, good for you... (Exclaims)"
3,40,Phineas,It's coming!
3,40,Isabella,AAAAHHHHH!!! We're doomed!
3,40,Baljeet,The prophecy has come true!
3,40,Phineas,We are about to pay for our over-consumption!
3,40,Buford,"You created me, Garbage-zilla! And now, puny humans, Prepare to be trashed! (trips and makes a loud noise) Whoa, whoa!"
3,40,Candace,Knock it off!
3,40,Linda,"Candace, I don't know what you kids are doing, but I'm taking an online knitting test in a few minutes, and I need it to be quiet around here. (sarcastic tone) You might not remember quiet. I'm not sure you two ever met. Anyway I'm putting you on noise patrol. You're in charge."
3,40,Candace,I'm in charge? Woo-hoo! Yeah!
3,40,Linda,Use a muffler. (leaves)
3,40,Candace,"(She grabs and puts a cushion over her face.) Oh, yeah. Woo-ho!"
3,40,Buford,"This time I want an air siren, and tap shoes."
3,40,Candace,"Phineas, Ferb, Mom put me on noise patrol while she's taking an online test. She needs it to be... (loudly) ABSOLUTELY QUIET!"
3,40,Linda,"(from upstairs) Candace, I'm trying to concentrate! (going back to her computer) Now let's see: ""What's the first ingredient in knitting a garment?"" Oh, I know that, it's love. (types it down, only to get the wrong answer) What do you mean, ""wool""?"
3,40,Candace,"You heard her, right? No noise. I want you silent, and invisible. Got it? (leaves)"
3,40,Buford,Silent and invisible!? What am I? A ninja?
3,40,Phineas,"That's it! Gang, I know what we're gonna do today! (pause) Speaking of silent and invisible, where's Perry?"
3,40,Major Monogram,"Agent P, we have a crisis. The Agency was going through Dr. Doofenshmirtz's trash this week when we found this. (shows a magazine with doodled on cover) Defaced magazine cover. Shameful! There were hundreds of similary defaced photos of good looking men, (shows a magizine of him on the cover with a devil face drawn onto it) including this handsom devil gracing the cover of Covert Lifestyles. My interest in this incident is purely professional, but put a stop to it!"
3,40,Major Monogram,(sobbing) Wh-hy? WH-H-H-HY?
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Hold on, Perry the Platypus, I'm just getting the mail. Oh, goody! It's my order from the Power Tool and Sleleton Key Warehouse. I was wondering when this was gonna -- OH! Look! At! This! Every week, the mailman makes the same mistake and I end up getting my neighbor's HS Weekly. Here, hold this, Perry the Platypus, I need to rant. (puts mail in front of Perry) I hate all these good-looking models on the cover of Handsome and Symmetrical Magazine, mocking me with their manly perfection. Their perfect hair, their perfect skin, I hate it! And this, is why I created...the De-Handsome-inator! Soon, all these good looking faces will be hideous! (Perry, free, punches him) Ow! Wait, did you use the skeleton key or was it the power tools?"
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Just for that, I'm not gonna tell you why the apple --"
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh, you know, I don't have the energy for this. It's still early, do you wanna go grab some lunch? Come on. I skipped breakfast this morning. (he and Perry walk out) You like eggs?"
3,40,Phineas,"Okay, gang, Ferb and I made these ninja outfits using smart garment technology. Once they're switched on, the outfits are designed to hide the wearer from anyone who's not wearing the suit."
3,40,Candace,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I smell noise! Is that what the black pajamas are for? You gonna have a noise party?"
3,40,Phineas,"Actually, it's the opposite. We're ninjas. Ninjas are renowned for their quiet and concealment. We made an outfit for you, too. (points to a ninja outfit for Candace)"
3,40,Buford,You should put it on. Take it from me. Black is slimming.
3,40,Candace,"No, thanks."
3,40,Phineas,"That's okay. We'll leave it here for you in case you change your mind. (at his friends) All right, ninjas! Let's turn on our outfits!"
3,40,Candace,"Hey! Where'd everyone go? (turns around several times, but the kids keep sneaking automatically out of her sight) That's so weird. Huh. Oh, I'll find them. (goes inside)"
3,40,Buford,"That was cool! I didn't have to do anything! The outfit did all the work! Whoa Phineas, which way are you facing?"
3,40,Phineas,Good question.
3,40,Phineas,Left.
3,40,Candace,"Stupid, stealthy ninjas! (slams door)"
3,40,Linda,"Candace, keep it down! (at her test) ""What do you call a clever knitter?"" (pause) I know! A knit wit! Heh! Is there anything better than knitting humor?"
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"I need to stop at the bank, I-I don't have any cash."
3,40,Woman 1,Ah... (faints)
3,40,Man 1,"(opens bank door for Doofenshmirtz) It's an honor, sir! A real honor! I can't wait to tell my wife!"
3,40,Woman 2,"Ooh, are you famous? You look like a model, are you an actor? You go first, I can wait!"
3,40,Man 2,"Please, I'm just getting some cash to pay medicine for my kids."
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"(at the bank teller) Yes, uh, hello. I just need to make a withdrawal from my account, please."
3,40,Bank teller,"(gives him money bags) Here, take this. It's on us."
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no. J-just enough for lunch."
3,40,Waitress,Sparkling sider?
3,40,Water,Scrambled eggs? That's real lobster in there.
3,40,Photographer,Preserve the moment! (takes his picture)
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Can you believe the service in this place, Perry the Platypus?"
3,40,Photographer,Here you go! All framed. (gives him the picture takes
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, ah, thank you! Eh -- (sees his picture) Heh heh, see, this isn't me. This is just the superhumanly attractive male model that came with the frame. I mean, look at this guy, right? That's funny, he's wearing a lab coat just like me -- (Perry holds up a mirror) Uhhhh?! Oh, this is horrible! I can't be handsome! It's -- it's everything I despise! Don't you understand? Beautiful people, they -- they just get everything they want in the world. I mean, watch this. Hey, lady, nice baby."
3,40,Woman 3,You want him? He likes you better.
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"No, I don't want your baby. (at Perry) You see, Perry the Platypus, the unfair advantage good-looking people have? (becomes conceited) Heeeey?! (at a man) If I ran for Mayor, would you vote for me?"
3,40,Man 3,Over and over again.
3,40,Man 4,"No, elections are for ugly people. I'm sure they'd just give him the mayorship."
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,Ya think?
3,40,Policeman,"Sure, you've already got a sizeable mob, and I bet we could pick up a couple thousand more on the way."
3,40,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, okay, then! On to City Hall!"

3,40,Phineas,"(quietly, behind Candace) I tried to tell you before."
3,40,Candace,"(turns around) Aha! (sees no one, constantly turns around) Uh...uh..."
3,40,Phineas,"You'll never be able to see us, unless you wear a ninja outfit yourself."
3,40,Candace,"Oh, I'll wear a ninja outfit, all right! Then, I'll bust the whole lot of you. (walks off, Phineas is on her back)"

Luckily it was pointed up, so it didn't hit anything. Anyway, I started thinking, and realized the true measure of a man is having a world famous roadside attraction. But which one to choose? Which one would be the most spectacular? Then it hit me, nothing brings them in like a big ball of twine. So that's why I built the Sphere-Attract-inator. To steal the worlds largest ball of twine! Then all I need is some sort of road to put it beside. Right?"

3,63,Lawrence,"Oh, so you have always been this sarcastic."
3,63,Linda,"Oh that's right, it's going to be you."
3,63,Lawrence,"You betcha, Duckie."
3,63,Candace,"One way or another, I'm going to see what all you eyeballs are making back here."
3,63,Phineas,"Sure, I want everyone to see, including Perry. Hey, where's Perry?"
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"A blackout? Oh, Perry the Platypus isn't this wonderful? Now people can't see anything but my pitiful eyes. Look at them, Perry the Platypus, don't you feel sorry for me? Don't my sad, lugubrious eyes illicit compassion and mercy? (He pauses) Your secret agent training has taught you to squint well my nemesis. But you can't fight the power of these pathetic, pleading eyes. I guess you can, 'cause you're heartless Perry the Platypus. You know that? Where you're heart should be, a big empty sack of nothing. But the common man will not be able to. I'm going to go find someone on the street and test these babies out. And you're coming with me. Here come on. It's a good thing I put wheels on this trap. Try to keep up."
3,63,Phineas,Somebody hand me that wrench.
3,63,Isabella,The power transformer is online.
3,63,Baljeet,It's a good thing you had this bicycle-powered generator.
3,63,Phineas,We like to be prepared for any eventuality. Thanks for pedaling by the way.
3,63,Baljeet,Buford was supposed to take over half an hour ago. But I cannot find him anywhere!
3,63,Buford,And you're not gonna.
3,63,Baljeet,"Buford, is that you?"
3,63,Buford,No.
3,63,Candace,"Come on you stupid thing, work! (The flashlight turns on) There. Now where is it? (sees a glimpse of mechanical arms) What the -- ? (The flashlight goes out) Ugh, stupid thing. What are you guys building?"
3,63,Candace,An anti-gravity device?
3,63,Phineas,"Nah, that's just the crane. Tighten the servomotor."
3,63,Isabella,Aye-aye.
3,63,Candace,"I'm going to fell my way through this. Okay, this feels like, metal. And this is some kind of wooden railing. Ooh, mushy-squshy."
3,63,Phineas,"We're not using any ""mushy-squshy"" stuff. But that's Perry's favorite spot."
3,63,Candace,"Okay, gross. Can you just tell me what you're building?"
3,63,Phineas,I'd love to. But it's kinda hard to put into words. You really just have to experience it.
3,63,Candace,Fine. Fire it up.
3,63,Phineas,Great. Put on this helmet. And this mouthguard. And this lead apron. Arms up... and you're ready to go.

3,63,Phineas,"Wow Candace, we never thought of riding it before."
3,63,Candace,I think I swallowed the mouth-guard.
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, Perry the Platypus, I see someone. You'll understand the power of my sad eyes when you see them in action. You ready? Watch this. Excuse me?"
3,63,Man,"Oh, you look so sad. I feel, I feel so sorry for you. What can I do? Here take this. There. And as soon as I find my home, I'll come back and give you more free stuff. You poor, poor thing."
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,You see? And I don't even know what it is.
3,63,Man 2,"Sir, your eyes, they compel me to help. Let me contribute. Here."
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,Thank you kind sir. Why is it all warm?

3,63,Doofenshmirtz,Don't they just?
3,63,Man 3,"Here, take all I have."
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,You gave me a wig?
3,63,Man 3,No.

3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, if it worked on that jetpack squad, I bet ya it'll work on my brother, Roger! He'll take pity on me, and make me mayor! And that's just a hop, skip and a jump from having people give me the whole Tri-State Area!"
3,63,Major Monogram,"(On Perry's wristwatch communicator) Thank goodness your wrist communicator is still working Agent P. We traced the blackout to the Danville power plant on 5th street. I know you're busy with Doofenshmirtz, and you don't normally handle stuff like this, but I was in the middle of microwaving a burrito, and center is still totally frozen. Just figured you were close, and uh... Hurry Agent P. it's, it's kind of scary in here, and I'm all alone.(There is a crash sound) Carl? C-Carl, is that you?"

3,63,Lawrence,What's all that noise?

3,63,Linda,"What do you think, should we tear down this fence?"
3,63,Lawrence,That's that sarcasm I like.
3,63,Candace,You can feel what they made. Come on!
3,63,Linda,"Candace, my arm!"
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"You, you know Perry the Platypus, I d- I didn't realize this trap would be so heavy. City Hall is still a few blocks away, you wouldn't mind if I just leave you here, do you? Hello?"
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,Where's Perry... the Platypus?

3,63,Phineas,A bunch of guys on jetpacks came by and asked if they could have it. So we gave it to them.
3,63,Linda,Oh you boys are so cute.
3,63,Candace,But what was it? What was it?!
3,63,Roger,So why is it that you think I'm just going to hand over my mayorship to you?
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, because I've got these big sad eyes."
3,63,Roger,"Yeah, and they're kind of freaking me out."
3,63,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, I guess it probably works better in the dark. Look, it's the jetpack squad."

3,62,Candace,"All right, what is this?"
3,62,Phineas,Table tennis.
3,62,Ferb,"Ping pong, for the layman."
3,62,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, but is it like, laser-activated, nuclear powered, supersonic ping pong?"
3,62,Phineas,"No, good idea though."
3,62,Candace,"Ping pong, huh? I bet. I'll just stay right here until the inevitable weirdness happens. Any minute now. Alright, so where's Perry?"
3,62,Major Monogram,"(Through Perry's wristwatch communicator) Monogram to Agent P. Already airborne, I see. I like that! Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased an inordinate number of chairs. Hundreds of them! Far more than necessary for a person with no friends, and only one tushee. Well actually I'm, I'm just sort of assuming about the tushee. But I'm pretty confident in the no friends thing. You think it'd be the other way around, but the way he's always playing with forbidden science, you can never really be... This is coming out kinda weird, huh. Look, you're going over their anyway, just, just take a look, okay? Monogram out."

3,62,Norm,Let's give him a big round of applause!
3,62,Norm,Tonight we explore the life of a true evil genius. And find out just what makes him tick.
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,But how?
3,62,Norm,"I'm glad you asked! With the help of our exciting but potentially lethal memory extraction technology, all of your most deeply suppressed memories will appear right on this screen! It's like a TV clip show fueled by your own brain. Now let's start our trip down memory strasse on the day of your birth, in beautiful Gimmelshtump, Drusselstein!"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't really remember much about it, I was pretty young at the time, but- ooh! Ooh-Ooh! (The tube connected to the helmet Doofenshmirtz is wearing begins to bubble) I can feel it tingling; something's coming out!"
3,62,Norm,"(Norm shows a clip from when Doofenshmirtz was born) Aww, how cute! But where's Mom?"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"She didn't, uh- show up for the birth."
3,62,Norm,Remember this voice?
3,62,Doctor,"When they are born, we slap their bottoms to start them breathing."
3,62,Norm,"Here he is, all the way from Gimmelshtump Memorial Hospital, Dr. Mortimer Shlussel."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Dr. Shlussel, so good to—Hey!"
3,62,Dr. Shluelsle,He is breathing.
3,62,Norm,And I'm sure you can guess who this next voice belongs to...
3,62,Mrs. Doofenshmirtz,"Heinz, my little hobbengusher."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, when she says ""hobbengusher"" like that, it's easy to forget that it means--"
3,62,Norm,It's your mother!
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,Mama!
3,62,Mrs. Doofenshmirtz,Hobbengusher. (She whacks him on the bottom as well)
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that's the way you normally say it."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,AH! Ow! Why!? Ow! Why!? Why!?
3,62,Norm,"Yes, your relationship with your mother left something to be desired. But, what about Dad?"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, yeah, you know, tho- those were hard times."
3,62,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,Bewegen Sie nicht! (Don't Move!)
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"While the other children played Kick-the-Schtumpel and eat Doonkelberries, I would stand for hours."
3,62,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,Bewegen Sie nicht!
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,All through the cold night as the Spitzenhound howled.... My only companion was the moon. And my neighbor Kenny.
3,62,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,Bewegen Sie nicht!
3,62,Norm,"What a fascinating life. We'll keep track of the level of emotional pain each backstory causes, on this colorful Gnome-o-Meter! As shown by Vanna, our gnome-o-meter spokesmodel. Looks like our gnome has begun his climb! (The gnome begins to travel up the Gnome-o-Meter) Scale those heights, you bearded, Scandinavian cutie! Perform a segue back to rights of passage!"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Smooth, Norm."
3,62,Norm,"Thank you, don't break the rhythm, sir."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"And let me tell you, transitioning to adulthood was painful, but, actually, I guess a good indicator of things to come. (in a flashback on screen) In Gimmelshtump, jumping from the high dive was an important rite of passage."
3,62,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,Are you a man or a schnitzel?!
3,62,Young Heinz,"I'm a man, I'm a man."
3,62,Queuing man,Das kind ist ein schnitzel! (That kid is a schnitzel!)

3,62,Roger,What exactly am I here for again?
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,(With distain) Roger.
3,62,Norm,"It's you brother, Roger Doofenshmirtz, beloved mayor of Danville. Everybody loves him."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, alright, enough with the cheering; this is my show, not his!"
3,62,Roger,Can I help it if Mommy liked me best?
3,62,Norm,"Look at all those burbling memory bubbles. Tell us all about it, Dr. D!"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(narrating over the clip) For a time, I was happy. It was a short time, it was... right... there. It was like five seconds when I was pushing the thing back and forth on the rug. And soon I learned my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, I was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year! Drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates."
3,62,"(clip changes) I wanted to gain my mother's affection somehow, so I went to the claw machine district in hopes of winning her a gift. Fortunately, I had with me my allowance, which I'd been saving for a whole year","one three-cent coin. I dropped it into a slot, then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! Odds were against me, but then it happened! The miracle! The claw grabbed the stuffed animal; it was mine! Then, like a knight of yore, I gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother... who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother, Roger. I was crushed as I watched Roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. And then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother, claiming both as his own, effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic."
3,62,Roger,"You know, Heinz, there's more than one way to a mother's heart."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Kickball. My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kick... well, I'll just let the song tell you."

3,62,Doofenshmirtz,I know people.
3,62,Roger,Really.
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"...No, not really; I told them it was for you."
3,62,Roger,"Mmhmm. Well, I've got a city to govern."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,Don't let your ego hit you on the way out!
3,62,Norm,"Although your family life was tough, your social life was. how should we say, a soul-shattering void."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(narrating over clip) A painful, but accurate choice of words, Norm. At the age of five, I was forced to throw my own surprise party."
3,62,Gunther Goat Cheese's goat,"(within the flashback, enters with a cake) Hello, boys and- oh. Mmm... awkward. (puts the cake down and leaves)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(narrating) Ten seconds later, they confiscated the cake; apparently there's a two-person minimum."
3,62,Norm,Ooh! That stings! Do you recall a young lad named Boris?
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, sure. Big Black Boots Boris the Bully. (clip starts) He was always kicking sand in my face. When I was in the sandbox: sand. My first date: sand! Balancing my checkbook: sand! The beach-- Oddly enough nothing. But I couldn't relax, because I kept waiting for it."
3,62,Norm,"Well, Boris owns a car dealership now, and declined to appear on this show. But he did send some sand! (a giant pile of sand drops on Doofenshmirtz)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(muffled) Well, at least he cared enough to do that."
3,62,Norm,You did have one friend...
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Balloony!! (clip starts) When I was a boy, the smell of pork emanating from me was so bad because of, well, the reason's unimportant, it was part of a different emotionally-scarring backstory; I'm not getting into... regardless, the smell of pork was so bad that no one would come near me. So one day the carnival came to town and I needed money because of, well another back story that... basically, my parents disowned me, I was being raised by ocelots. The point is, I had to get a job at the carnival, but the only work was at the dunking booth, and not as the guy who got dunked though, I was what they threw to dunk him, which is again a whole other backstory. Okay, look- long backstory short, I got a balloon at the carnival, I drew a face on him, I sprayed him with special ""Lifelong-Lasting"" spray I created, and I named him ""Balloony."" He became my best friend in the whole world, yadda yadda yadda. Then one tragic day, when I was protecting our garden as a lawn gnome, Balloony started floating away. (clip ends) And then I didn't see him for a long time; it wasn't 'til... well, there was this whole thing with an alien ship, it was really improbable."
3,62,Norm,"Well, here he is! (Balloony is seen in front of a backdrop)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Balloony, I-I've missed you so mu- (Balloony pops; Doofenshmirtz gasps) Baaaallllooooonnnyyyy!!"
3,62,Norm,Ha-ha-ha! We're just having fun with you! That wasn't the real Balloony!
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,It wasn't?
3,62,Norm,"No, of course not! The real Balloony popped three weeks ago! (holds up the popped Balloony)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,(bawling) BAAAALLLLLOOOOONNNNNNYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! (continues bawling over Norm's line)
3,62,Norm,"Aaand uncomfortable transition back to the Gnome-o-Meter! (gnome rises from 10,000 past the 15,000 line) Wow, that backstory really had some juice. Now, if you've finished weeping, let's continue! In another misguided attempt to engage in life, you entered one of your inventions in a science fair!"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(clip starts) That's right. It- it was my very first -inator! Just as I was about to demonstrate my invention to the judges, a kid with a baking soda volcano stole the show! The next year, I tried again with my even bigger -inator. And again, my thunder was stolen by a baking soda volcano! I'd had enough of science. I decided to devote my life to poetry instead."
3,62,Young Adult Doofenshmirtz,"The movies are gray, the TV is black, the horses are running, please bring me some food."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"(narrating) Yet, curiously, I still lost to a baking soda volcano! (clip ends) And what's worse, his poetry lacked subtext entirely. Hey, where's Perry?"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, what are you do- (Perry looks behind a curtain) Okay, playtime's over! Norm? (Norm flips a lever, lifting the curtain to reveal a glass dome with a bubbling liquid inside and electrodes on top; a metal claw comes down and lifts Perry off the ground) Behold, the Backstory-inator! You see, evil is born from pain and loss, but reliving one story at a time was not getting me anywhere! Now with this, I can collect the liquid essence of all my pain and suffering! And when it's all full, I can re-inject it into myself, making me the most powerfully evil person that has ever lived. Then nothing can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-State Are-aaugh!! (screams as an ocelot attacks him)"
3,62,Norm,"Oh, there's Mama Ocelot."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Ironically, she's still more nurturing than my own mother! Ow, off, quit it!"
3,62,Candace,"Any time now, they're going to do something big and bustable. I just know it."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"And so, Perry the Platypus, to recap what I said mere moments ago before I was so rudely and painfully interrupted, once I have charged my Backstory-inator, the tragedy of it all will be re-injected back into me, and I will be transformed into the ultimate creature of evil! And look, we're almost there! (the gnome is shown teetering at the summit of the Gnome-o-Meter) One more backstory should do it! Let's see... remember the time..."

3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it was when I was sixteen, or thereabouts; I had stopped celebrating birthdays at that point for... you know, obvious reasons. (clip begins) And then one day, my parents sent me out to the Schtor to get some doozenbratt. (in the clip, the ""Schtor"" is revealed to be a painting of the front of a Schtor hiding the entrance to a ship; the ship takes off and Heinz's parents celebrate and hug) You know, I've always had trouble between a Schtor and a- a painting of a Schtor, but- but it started me off on the greatest adventure of my life! I decided to seize the day with both hands! (Heinz is shown swabbing the poop deck) Aaand a mop. I was heading to a golden land of opportunity; a land with a pioneering spirit which welcomed misfits like me! But I ended up in America instead. (Heinz is literally kicked off the ship) I just knew that I was home! (a large crate lands on Heinz; flashback ends) In the sense that it was... familiar. (gnome rises to 20,000)"

3,62,80's Heinz,"It's okay, I'd say it's in my top seven, eight favorite songs about reverse engineering."
3,62,80's Linda,Makes me want to be a pop star!
3,62,80's Heinz,"Ha! Yeah right, and I'm going to rule the world!"
3,62,80's Linda,"Well, why not?"
3,62,80's Heinz,"Yeah, like I could do that."
3,62,80's Linda,"Maybe instead of, you know, the whole world, uh, start... small, with the Tri-State Area. (dramatic chord plays) Hey, the movie's starting!"
3,62,Norm,"It was at that point that you realized the only business for you was... I'm waiting for you to finish my sentence for me, sir..."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, of course. Bratwurst!"
3,62,Norm,"Actually, I was going to say ""evil,"" sir."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, but before I was evil, I was a bratwurst street vendor. (clip starts)"
3,62,Kid 1,How do you know when you're really lame?
3,62,Kid 2,When you sell bratwurst! (kids laugh)
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, that seemed more painful at the time. Oh man, it's gonna take forever to get the gnome back up to the top at this rate."

3,62,Doofenshmirtz's unnamed ex-girlfriend,Nothing!
3,62,Norm,And do you recall this voice?
3,62,Charlene,"Hello, Heinz. I have your alimony check."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,Heh-heh... Charlene!
3,62,Norm,"That's right. It's your former wife, Charlene Doofenshmirtz."
3,62,Charlene,"Delivered in person, like you asked. Ah, what is this, a game show set? Is this what you spend the money on?"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you know, also groceries."
3,62,Charlene,"Well, at least it's not in my garage. Nice tux, Norm."
3,62,Norm,She's fantastic!
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm, let's bring out the big guns: Failed -inators! (montage set to 1812 Overture begins)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, at least I found the key to the- (his roof explodes) Nice. Curse you, Perry the- (the roof crashes down again) Oh... Why does everything explode so easily? (the entire top of his building explodes)"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"You know what I'm noticing a lot of? I blow up more than the average guy. (Perry notices a ceiling fan near his trap while Vanna is on the phone and starts swinging toward it) Do they have blowing-up insurance? I should get some of that. And if they don't have it, I think they should make it, 'cause I would buy some. Oh, baby, what an emotional workout!"
3,62,Norm,And one more good trauma should send Arthur over the top! (the gnome is shown teetering at the edge of the summit)
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha-ha, yeah! Hit me with your best shot!"
3,62,Norm,"That's just it, sir! The rest are more comical than tragic."
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"What? How are we supposed to go over the- OOF! (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz off his chair) Aw, curse you, Perry the Platypus- and by ""curse you,"" I mean ""thank you!"" By humiliating me, you have inadvertently provided me the last tragic backstory I need to put this baby over the top! Remember two seconds ago when you foiled my latest plan? I do!"
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,(in flashback) What? How are we supposed to go over the- OOF! (it repeats as Doofenshmirtz laughs evilly) How are we supposed to go over the- OOF!
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"And now...! (the Backstory-inator starts to send the memories back to Doofenshmirtz) I can feel myself getting (his skin takes a red tint and his teeth become sharp) more e-e-evil!! (his laugh becomes deeper and he grows massive and muscular) Feel the doom!! Nothing can stop me now!

3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"No! What have you done, Perry the Platypus? I'm getting less evil! (crashes into and smashes the Backstory-inator) Significantly sooooooo!!

3,62,Vanna,(leaving with the gnome still in her foot) I'm sending you a bill for the shoes. My boyfriend's a lawyer.
3,62,Doofenshmirtz,"All right, Norm, let's get this place cleaned up. There's backstory all over the place."
3,62,Candace,"Uhh, fine, you've bored me into submission. (leaves)"
3,62,Phineas,"One million five hundred sixty-two thousand nine hundred seventy-two... One million five hundred sixty-two thousand nine hundred seventy-eight! (the ball stops over the net, hovering and glowing white) We did it! We've stored up enough kinetic energy; the quantum vortex should appear any second now. (the ball sucks the table, the boys, and the entire background up, leaving only a blank white screen; Candace walks on, hesitantly and frightened)"
3,62,Candace,(looks around) ...Mom?
3,48,Phineas,"Boy, it seems like summer flies by so fast sometimes."
3,48,Isabella,"Yeah, before we know it, it'll be autumn."
3,48,Baljeet,"Yes! Back to school, baby! ...Oh, you meant that like a bad thing."
3,48,Phineas,There are a lot of great things about the fall. Jumping in giant leaf piles. Perfect example.
3,48,Isabella,"Yeah, the leaves turn such pretty colors in the fall. I love it."
3,48,Buford,Gourds. Gourds are great ...What? I like gourds.
3,48,Phineas,"I know what we should do today. Remember how we made ""S'Winter""? Let's make ""S'Fall""! Hey, where's ""S'Perry""?"
3,48,Major Monogram,Carl.
3,48,Carl,Yes?
3,48,Major Monogram,Did I ever tell you you're like the son that I never had?
3,48,Carl,"Really, sir!?"
3,48,Major Monogram,"Yes. It's because you're so unlike the son that I did have! And here he is. Come on over here, Monty!"
3,48,Monty,"Dad, come on. You know it's embarrassing when you brag about me by belittling others."
3,48,Major Monogram,"Right, sorry. Agent P, uh, you remember my son?"
3,48,Monty,"Yeah, good to see you, Agent P."
3,48,Major Monogram,Monty here just graduated from HSWACA! The High School Without A Cool Acronym.
3,48,Monty,Yes. I hope to follow in my father's footsteps and join you in the battle against evil.
3,48,Major Monogram,"You know, son, I've been meaning to tell you something."
3,48,Monty,"Sure, Dad, shoot."
3,48,Major Monogram,"Well, as you know, my father was in the agency, and what you don't know is that he pressured me into following in his footsteps. But I always wanted to be an acrobat!"
3,48,Monty,So that explains...
3,48,Major Monogram,"Yes, the constant acrobatic lessons you've been given since birth. You, Monty Monogram, don't have to give up my dream of becoming an acrobat. You can be anything you want to be."
3,48,Monty,"But, Dad, I want to fight evil."
3,48,Major Monogram,What? After all that money we spent on acrobat training? (Perry gains an awkward expression)
3,48,Monty,I never asked for that!
3,48,Carl,"Sir, I'll become an acrobat if it'll make you proud of me!"
3,48,Major Monogram,"Really? Hmm. (Takes Carl off for the acrobatic training but comes back to the screen) Oh, yeah, Agent P, uh, stop Doof. (Perry glares at him)"
3,48,Vanessa,"A video game is more important than me? That's it! I'm done! We are so over, Johnny!"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, hello, Vanessa! Let me introduce Rodrigo to you. He's starting evil science school in the fall and I'm mentoring him. I'm in mid-ment."
3,48,Rodrigo,Call me Rod.
3,48,Vanessa,Is that what your friends call you?
3,48,Rodrigo,No one calls me that. It's just that you seem rather unique.
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"So, what's wrong, Vanessa? You seem upset."
3,48,Vanessa,"Nothing. It's just... Johnny, he's such a boy. I'm sick of it. No ambition, no depth..."
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"You always go for the wrong type of guy, these bad-boy types."
3,48,Vanessa,"Dad, perhaps you haven't noticed but you're evil."
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, there's good evil and then there's bad evil. Am I right, Rodrigo?"
3,48,Rodrigo,Huh? Exactly.
3,48,Baljeet,"So, how do we get all the leaves down, anyway?"
3,48,Buford,Way ahead of you. Grab an end. (Hands Baljeet a saw)
3,48,Isabella,Buford! You can't! That's Phineas's tree. That's the tree!
3,48,Buford,Sentimentality or leaves. You can't have both.
3,48,Phineas,"Au contraire. If you would kindly direct your attention to Ferb, who is modeling this ""s'fall"" season's fashion in rapid leaf production accelerators."
3,48,Phineas,"Ooh-la-la, Monsieur Fletcher."
3,48,Candace,"Anyway, Stacy, so I decided that from now on, I'm going to stop always interrupting my life with all these stu... (gasps as she sees the leaves blocking the door) Stacy, I gotta call you back. Oh I see. So they think they can stop me from seeing whatever giant project they're working on today by plastering leaves all over the door, huh? Well, it's not gonna work! A-ha! ...Um, they've built a big wall of leaves to block the door! Well, I'll just dig in here and, uh..."
3,48,(Song,S'Fall (instrumental))
3,48,Phineas,Now that's a leaf pile.
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Backstory! Backstory! Backstory! (Breaks his pointer.) The backstory is what drives an evil scientist. It is the ""Why does he do what he does?"" of the ""What does he do?"" (Accidentally throws a broken half of the pointing rod, causing a cat to yowl.) My point is, at its best, evil science is like undergoing deep Freudian analysis with a theremin constantly playing in the background."
3,48,Vanessa,"Hey, guys, it's such a beautiful day. I thought maybe we could put the top down?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, okay."
3,48,Vanessa,"See, you are the best..."
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,No tattoo.
3,48,Vanessa,Shoot.
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus! Just in time...To be trapped!"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,Now that's what I call getting the boot!
3,48,Rodrigo,Wow! A real agent!
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"See, now that's a trap! I even made it based on my own daughter's fashion style. Vampire-pilgrim-scuba-diver."
3,48,Vanessa,"What? Is that what you think I look lik... Wait, you made this? What size is it?"
3,48,Rodrigo,"Excuse me the interrupting, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but he can get out of there fairly easy, no?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, duh, the trap only needs to hold him for just enough time for you to get through your evil scheme monologue. At that point, your nemesis escapes and the race is on! Who will win, good or evil? No one can say, except, of course, if you go by recent statistics which, it's pretty much good who wins every single time. No matter what. But, hey, if it was easy, everyone would take over the Tri-State Area, right? Every single person would be in charge and we'd be forced to, I don't know, decide the rules together by voting or something."
3,48,Rodrigo,"I see. It's just that I took a few advanced trap classes in school and I was hoping to show you, the master, a few of my little ideas in the hopes that you could critique them."
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm, all right, knock yourself out."
3,48,Rodrigo,"Don't worry, little platypus agent. When I'm through here, you'll no longer have to battle this inept loser anymore. Because, you see, I plan to get rid of both of you."
3,48,Phineas,"Okay, now we've determined that the sweet spot for entering the pile is right here, at the top."
3,48,Buford,"Oh, and I made gourd helmets, by the way. (Buford starts giving the gourd helmets to his friends.) Here. Here. No, wait, Baljeet, this is yours. Phineas. I like to think each individual's gourd helmet captures their unique essence in some way, you know, in gourd."
3,48,Isabella,Exactly how does this capture my essence?
3,48,Buford,"Right, like that's not obvious."
3,48,Phineas,"Yeah, come on. Stop kidding around, Isabella. Oh I think we're over the drop zone. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""s'fall""!"
3,48,(Song,S'Fall)
3,48,Candace,"Huh? What are they up to today? Do they really think they can escape Mom's wrath by hiding in this fun, massive, glorious, autumnal leaf pile? Well, not if I can help it!"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Hmm, how does it feel, Perry the Platypus?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, I thought so."
3,48,Rodrigo,"Wait, you can understand him?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, heck no, I usually just pretend he's talking about recent movies I've seen."
3,48,Vanessa,"(Trying on Doofenshmirtz's boot trap) So, uh, you didn't by any chance make a left-boot trap, did you?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,(scoffs) A left-boot trap? Whoever heard of such a thing?
3,48,Monty,"Uh, Dad? This looks pretty serious."
3,48,Major Monogram,Nonsense. The Zoondilini under swing is child's play.
3,48,Carl,"Uh, should both my shoulders be dislocated from their sockets, sir?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Using my intimate knowledge of the Tri-State Area, I have installed, in two precise locations, these!"
3,48,Random person,(at a vendor) Yay! Falafel!
3,48,Vanessa,Cool.
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"I know, huh? These massive propellers will physically dislodge the entire Tri-State Area from the Earth and raise it up into the sky where I will then pilot it around and you know, run some errands or something, and refuse to return it, until they make me their leader. (Doofenshmirtz activates the propellers, dislodging the Tri-State Area from the Earth.) Hmm. Well, that went well."
3,48,Rodrigo,Extremely well. (He pushes a button that activates a hidden trap that ties Doofenshmirtz's legs together.)
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,Is this like a robot hug for a job well done?
3,48,Rodrigo,"No. It's a trap! What does that even mean, a robot hug for a job well... Who would even consider that a possibility!? I'm taking over your evil scheme, you fool! (He pushes a button that pulls Doofenshmirtz away from the controls.)"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,(screams)
3,48,Vanessa,"Dad, look out! Wha... (She tries to move but she's wearing Perry's boot trap, which is attached to the floor.) Oh, you have got to be kidding me."
3,48,Rodrigo,"(Explains his plan using the blackboard that Doofenshmirtz used earlier.) You see, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, I'm going to manipulate your propellers at precise angles and literally tear the Tri-State Area apart!"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"But, hey, dummy, if you destroy the Tri-State Area, what exactly will you have left to take over? Hmm?"
3,48,Rodrigo,The world.
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,(gasps) Take over the world? Tha..That's crazy! That's almost left-boot-trap crazy!
3,48,Vanessa,"Oh, would you get off that? Making matching boots is normal. You with the one boot, that's what's crazy."
3,48,Rodrigo,"Join me, Vanessa, and together we will take over the world. I'll let you get a tattoo. I think boots should come in pairs, like people."
3,48,Vanessa,"Join you? I don't work for him. That's my father, you dweeb."
3,48,Rodrigo,"Well, yeah, I just thought we had a moment."
3,48,Vanessa,(scoffs) A moment?
3,48,Vanessa,"Yeah, I know. What a dip, right?"
3,48,Rodrigo,"No matter. Now, time to say goodbye to your beloved Tri-State Area!"
3,48,Major Monogram,Huh? Great googly moogly! Combining fighting evil with acrobatics? Of course! It was right in front of my face the whole time. That's my boy!
3,48,Candace,(screaming)
3,48,Buford,Gourd helmet. (Places a gourd helmet on Candace as she slides by.)
3,48,Candace,"A-ha! I got you now! Ooooh, you are so busted! I can see that you're eating... candy apples. Not something I can bust you for."
3,48,Phineas,"You want one, Candace?"
3,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, how about this one? (He pushes a button which frees himself.) Good. Okay, well, at least I can still go on with my plan. (He manipulates the propellers in a vertical position. He raises the Tri-State Area once again.) I should go pick up my dry cleaning before it gets too..."
3,48,Linda,"(from inside) Kids, I'm home!"
3,48,Candace,Mom! (Runs to her) Mom! The boys are up to something huge! I just know it! But they've hidden it within a massive pile of leaves in the backyard. Come help me sort through them for a few hours to find it! (Pulls her out)
3,48,Linda,(Sarcastically) Wow. Sounds great.
3,48,Linda,No leaves? No nothing?
3,48,Candace,"No leaves, no nothing."
3,48,Linda,(at the boys and their friends) Do you guys already have snacks?
3,48,Phineas,"We do, thanks!"
3,48,Linda,"(With disdain) My work here is done. (Straightens Candace's gourd helmet and leaves) Nice gourd helmets, though."
3,48,Ferb,"Well, who's up for ""sprummer""?"
3,48,Rodrigo,(grunts)
3,48,Monty,"Okay, you got it from here, Agent P."
3,48,Rodrigo,"But, Vanessa, I thought you liked bad boys?"
3,48,Vanessa,"Eh, I'm over it. I think it's time I tried a... (She watches Monty leave using a jet-pack. Monty looks at her and smiles before leaving.) A good guy."

3,60,Buford,"So then the seamstress walks back into the stateroom and says, "" 'Titanium'? I thought she said 'cranium'!"" Hahaha, yeah. Pretty good punch line, huh?"
3,60,Baljeet,"Yes. All you need now is the first part, and then you will have a whole joke."
3,60,Phineas,"Hey, look everyone, Ferb and Perry are back."
3,60,Buford,"Hey, Ferb!"
3,60,Isabella,What'cha doin' back from debate camp so soon?
3,60,Ferb,We finished earlier than expected.
3,60,Debater,"You're right. Judges, he's right. He's changed my entire world-view. Thank you."
3,60,Judge 1,It's so beautiful.
3,60,Judge 2,"That kid is in it to win it, dawg."
3,60,Phineas,You're just in time for acorn nut muffins made out of the training nuts from yesterday!
3,60,Ferb,"Training nuts? Okay, what did I miss?"
3,60,Phineas,It all started simply enough.
3,60,Phineas,(Narrating) I'd gotten up early to help Isabella earn her surf patch.
3,60,Isabella,Thanks for helping me earn my surf patch!
3,60,Phineas,"(Narrating) And I told her it was no problem. (In flashback) No problem. (Narrating) It was at that point that I decided to stop narrating. (in flashback) My schedule's wide open. Here, take a look at this. I figured I'd make a few prototypes and once you pick your favorite, we'll design your board to look just like it."
3,60,Isabella,"Awww, they're so cute and tiny a squirrel could surf on them. Now, if we only had a box of squirrels."
3,60,Baljeet,We found a box of squirrels!
3,60,Buford,"Yeah, right next to a box of scorpions, which is what I wanted to bring over."
3,60,Baljeet,"Buford, I won Rochambeau fair and square."
3,60,Isabella,What's Rochambeau?
3,60,Phineas,Rock-paper-scissors!
3,60,Isabella,Why didn't he just say that?
3,60,Buford,(Angrily) In what universe would a piece of paper ever beat a rock?
3,60,Phineas,"Hey, let's see the little guys."
3,60,Baljeet,"Okay, but do not expect too much from them."
3,60,Phineas,What's wrong with them?
3,60,Baljeet,They appear to have been domesticated. They have no squirrel skills. Check it out.
3,60,Baljeet,Here little squirrellies. Here is a nut.
3,60,Phineas,"(to the squirrels) It's a nut, you eat it. (to Baljeet) I see what you mean. No squirrel skills. Ferb, I... Oh, that's right, he went to debate camp today."
3,60,Baljeet,"Oh, oh! I will be Ferb! I have been practicing!"
3,60,Isabella,"That's pretty good, Baljeet."
3,60,Phineas,Wow! It's as if he's right in front of us.
3,60,Buford,"Oh! Oh! Say ""Where's Perry?"" now. I've been practicing."
3,60,Phineas,Okay. Where's Perry?
3,60,Buford,I don't know. What are you asking me for?
3,60,Phineas,"And so, that's how the day began. Hey, where's Perry now?"
3,60,Major Monogram,"Welcome back, Agent P. We hope you had a pleasant day off. Anyways, there's a crisis brewing in Danville, (camera pans to Perry, who grips his seat, then switches back to Major Monogram) and it could destroy the very fabric of our existence. There's never been a greater threat. Peaches! (Perry is shown with a confused look on his face, Major Monogram continues) Oh, you probably want me to explain the... (Major Monogram chuckles to himself) There's been a shortage of peaches in Danville lately, and we've traced it to Doofenshmirtz. Go find out what he's up to, and good... (Perry leaves) luck. Wow, guess he's in a hurry."
3,60,Phineas,It was about that time that Candace came up to us and said...
3,60,Candace,Phineas and Ferb! I demand to know what it is that you've got planned today!
3,60,Phineas,"Yeah, that."
3,60,Baljeet,Exactly like yesterday!
3,60,Buford,Except for the Ferb part.
3,60,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, thanks. What are you guys doing?"
3,60,Phineas,We're talking about what we did yesterday.
3,60,Candace,"So, it's, like, a confession?"
3,60,Phineas,Sure.
3,60,Phineas,"Good idea, Can..."
3,60,Candace,"(points at Phineas) Now, don't say another word until we get back. (she points at Ferb) And that goes for you, too."
3,60,Phineas,"That was ironic, because Ferb doesn't usually talk."
3,60,Candace,(off screen) Duh!
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello, Perry the Platypus! I take it for granted sometimes what a professional you are, especially after dealing with that guy they sent instead of you yesterday. So how was debate camp?"
3,60,Debater,"(to Perry) You're right. (to judges) Judges, he's right. He's changed my entire world-view. And I thought that British kid was persuasive."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, if you were flashing back just now, I couldn't see it. I'll bet you're wondering what I'm doing here at the beach... At the clam bake. With an oven. And normally, I'd be all about telling you, and it's a really cool plan, too! It involves my latest invention, the Peach Cobbler-inator."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,But I'm getting way ahead of myself. I have to tell you about yesterday for any of this to make any sense! It all started with an establishing shot at my building.
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,(while cleaning an -inator) Huh. Perry the Platypus should be arriving right about... Now!
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"How completely unexpected! (climbs down the ladder) And by that I mean, it really was actually enexpected. (walks towards Agent R) Well, you have a hat, so you must be an agent. I guess that means Perry the Platypus is not coming, so... (takes a controller from his lab coat) A-ha!"
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Consider yourself trapped. Allow me to explain my diabolical plan. You see, my brother, Roger, the mayor, is hosting a beauty contest that will..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey! (sighs) For Pete's sake, I'm pontificating here! Sheesh! Okay, okay. Long evil plan short, I wanted to ruin Roger's day. You see, he's officiating at an ""Everyone's A Winner"" beauty pageant. (scoffs) That's so him. Uh, my scheme involved domesticated squirrels, paper doilies, and those containers that pantyhose used to come in. You know, about this big? (Agent R glares) But, uh, I couldn't figure out a way to make them all work together..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"...because I was distracted by a leaky faucet in the kitchen! Turns out that was actually the perfect idea. So I ditched the squirrels... You know, this isn't really making my evil plan short like I promised. Sorry. Anyway, behold! The A-Leaky-Faucet-inator. I will disgrace and humiliate Roger by dropping one big drop of water and..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, where'd you go? (Camera pans to Agent R, who's eating from the trash) Oh, no! You're getting coffee grounds everywhere! This is so much smoother with Perry the Platypus. I'm just saying."
3,60,Candace,"(while pushing Linda) Right out here, Mom!"
3,60,Linda,"(waves) Hi, kids! (to Candace) All right, what's this all about?"
3,60,Phineas,We're telling Ferb the story of what we did yesterday.
3,60,Linda,"Oh, I love stories!"
3,60,Candace,"Oh, oh, it's not just stories, but full disclosure!"
3,60,Linda,Okay. (to Phineas) Go ahead.
3,60,Buford,"Well, we finally got to the musical part of the story. We all decided it was high time to teach the squirrels how to be squirrels."
3,60,(Song,"""Be a Squirrel"")"
3,60,Buford,C'mon. C'mon.
3,60,Isabella,Whooouhh...
3,60,Linda,"(after a pause) Buford, you taught the squirrels to dance?"
3,60,Buford,I'm like an onion.
3,60,Baljeet,Because you have layers?
3,60,Buford,"Yeah, that, too."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Anyway, after I cleaned up the coffee grounds, I loaded the A-Leaky-Faucet-inator and Agent R, I guess,..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,(narrating) ...onto my rocket skiff and headed off to Roger's beauty contest. We arrived just in time for the swimsuit competition.
3,60,Roger,"Oh, very nice. Twelve meters. We have a new record."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"There he is, the big show-off. With his big smile (leans against Agent R) and his keys in his pocket and his lumberjack-like..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey! Hey, no. Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here. Go find another symbiotic relationship! Anyway, now that we've... Hey, hey! What do you... This actually feels great. Oh, I see why you like it. Anyway, and I'm going to power up the inator now. (pushes a button on the inator) Here we go. Powering up."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Yup. You know, uh, this is the time where you escape and try to destroy my inator. Oh, for Pete's sake, I... (releases Agent R) There! Now, attack! Start thwarting! (Agent R walks away) No... No, no, no, no, don't just walk awa... (sighs) I miss Perry the Platypus."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Whoa! Wait, wait, wait. Watch out there."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,Why isn't the water coming off? It's beautiful.
3,60,Buford,"Good job, cadets! Now, back down the tree. No, not like that! Head first! Sheesh, it's like I'm talking to myself here."
3,60,Candace,"Let's go, Mom. You got to see this."
3,60,Phineas,"Wow, look at 'em go!"
3,60,Isabella,They're doing a pyramid! I didn't even teach them that.
3,60,Buford,"Good luck, little guys. I'll think of you whenever I get a rabies shot! Which is often."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,(screaming)
3,60,Roger,"Thank you, Katie Bogosian, for the whistling belly button performance. You probably should see a doctor. But that concludes our talent competition, unless there are any last-minute drop-ins?"
3,60,Judge 1,It's so beautiful.
3,60,Judge 2,"That pharmacist is in it to win it, dawg! (Cameras pans left to reveal a dog) See, I'm actually talking to a dog. That's right. Talkin' to a dawg."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"(now wearing a pink sash with the words ""KING PRETTY PRETTY PRINCESS"" in red lettering) And I was crowned (places a crown on his head) King Pretty Pretty Princess. Which, now that I think of it, is a contradiction in terms, but it was the first time I ever won anything. So it's gotten me all obsessed about entering contests. But the only thing I'm good at is baking peach cobbler, so I, I invented... Oh, yeah. I told you, ""Behold the Peach-Cobbler-inator."" What it does is it makes everyone want peach cobbler more than anything else in the world. So whether it's a chili cook-off or a dancing competition or a quiliting bee, or whatever, the, the judges will be compelled to choose peach cobbler as the winner every time."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Plus, it's waterproof, it's shockproof, (Camera pans back to him) it's windproof, it's..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Huh. But it isn't sandproof. Fancy that. I suppose, since I planned to take it to the beach, maybe I should have considered..."
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Perry the Platypus... and my own poor planning skills! (notices smoke coming from an oven) Oh, no! My cobbler! Oh! How can this day get any worse?"
3,60,Doofenshmirtz,Ow! Does that mean this thing's been flying around since yesterday?
3,60,Candace,"So, there you have it! Are you gonna bust them, or what? (stands up) Wait. (takes out a camera) Okay, go ahead."
3,60,Linda,"Actually, I just love that you kids trained poor, abandoned little squirrels and helped them get back to the wild. I am so proud of you!"
3,60,Candace,"No, you can't! I want justice! I want... (the ray from the Peach-Cobbler-inator hits her) Peach cobbler."
3,60,Linda,"Well, lucky for you, I made peach cobbler."
3,60,Candace,Peach cobbler.
3,60,Linda,"I heard you the first time, honey."
3,60,(Song,"""Be a Squirrel"")"
3,60,Buford,C'mon. C'mon.
3,60,Isabella,Whooouhh...
3,61,Phineas,"(offscreen) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
3,61,Buford,"A quilt?! No way! I mean, I know it's been a long summer and you guys are running out of ideas and-"
3,61,Isabella,That's okay. Buford. You don't have to hang with us everyday.
3,61,Buford,"No no no, I mean I mean I don't wanna play alone. I'll turn into a cat-kid."
3,61,Phineas,What's a cat-kid?
3,61,Buford,It's a kid version of a cat lady.
3,61,Buford,"Quick! Somebody say ""Where's Perry?""."
3,61,Baljeet,Where's Perry?
3,61,Buford,(sighs happily) You're always there for me.
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(turns around) Oh, it's you."
3,61,Doofenshimirtz,"Yeah, so no time for traps. It's nothing personal, you see today is the annual L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Summer Stock Festival and I got the title role, so I have to take over the Tri-State Area by 3:30 if I wanna make the curtain! Uh, that doesn't leave me much time for, you know, the trapping and the fighting. So instead I built this! The Trip-To-The-Desert-inator! It's going to send you to the desert, and I can get on with my day. (Activates the -inator, Perry starts to run away) Don't bother running, because I installed a Perry-Track-inator. It's going to follow you no matter where you-"
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great! Now I'm in the middle of nowhere! Now I'll never be able to take over the Tri-State Area before.... the play. (Perry starts to leave via his jetpack) Wait, wait, d-don't leave me here! Uh, Perry the Platypus, please! It's important to me! And if this works out, I might give up evil for acting! Won't you give me that chance, to succeed at something that might very well turn my life away from the evil path? Do it for the kids. Do it for the orphans.... that I might perform in front of someday if I ever do a show in an orphanage."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't want to be ungrateful or anything, but is there any way to speed this up? I gotta be in the make-up chair at 4 o'clock. Hey, what about this turbo switch? That oughta shave off some time, hey, right, yeah? (Flips the switch which causes the jetpack to sped off into the distance as him and Perry fall and land on the ground) Some pilot you are. (Glares back at Perry, who then points accusingly at him) Oh sure, blame the victim. Like you didn't know about my switch-flipping compulsion. (Perry starts to run away angrily) Oh, now you're mad, sure, I don't know why I tried to be nice, I should have just trapped you, I could have been out of the hospital and on my way to the theater by now. (Starts to walk towards Perry) Instead they'll end up using my understudy. Ughh, I hate that guy!"
3,61,Rodney,"So, if Doofenshmirtz is late, I get to go on?"
3,61,Man #1,"(Unknown line) time for this entrance, you can have the part."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"I guess it is summer and we're in the desert, but I I feel like it's unseasonably warm out here. I feel warm. Do you feel warm? Why do we always see cow skulls in the desert? And why do you only see the skull? Did the body die somewhere else? It makes no sense. (Perry walk away) Oh, I'm sorry, am I talking too much for you? Fine. I'll be quiet. I can shut up. I don’t have to talk all the time. It's not like I have to fill the space.... If you want silence, I'll give you silence! You watch!... And it's gonna be deafening! Mark my words!"
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Why do they say ""Mark my words?"" I mean, they just mean listen to my words, why don't they just say ""Listen to my words""?"
3,61,(Song,Heck of a Day)
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, look how big the sun is through this magnifying glass. (Gets harmed off-screen) Ow! Ow! Oh!...No really, it's huge, you should see it."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"I mean, he drives a taxi, for heavens' sake, he can work anywhere. He expects her to just pack up and move to Vegas. Seriously."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"I was sure my arm would grow back, but it never did. (taps his left arm which makes a metallic sound) See? Pure titanium. It's a fact."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"You don't communicate, you know that? You don't share. I know nothing about your private life. Perry closed off...... Closed, that's you."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"So I never touched an iguana again. Actually, that's not entirely true. There was one time, back in a—oh! Ooh ooh ooh! Look, Perry the Platypus, look! Two tires and an axle! Ahh, pretty soon we'll be rolling out of here! We're just gotta, gotta hop this fence. (Perry waves a finger back and forth) What do you mean no?! (Perry points to a ""No Trespassing"" sign on the gate) No trespassing! Oh oh you gotta be kidding me! You know what Perry the Platypus? I just have my third realization of the day, I have two earlier but I didn't share them with you. I've realized that the thing that's kept me from succeeding all this years isn't my parents not showing up after my birth, it isn't my eight month sting as organ griven monkey, it isn't the time that my arm got stuck under that boulder, also titanium see? (taps his right arm which also makes a metallic sound), it isn't any of those things. You know what it is? It's you! (points to Perry, who then crosses him arms) You are who's been holding my back all these years."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(sarcastically) Oh, very clever, that my accusing finger and pointing it back at me. (Normal) So so you think I'm responsible for my failures? (Perry nods) You're wrong! I can prove it. If you just let me try my junkyard scheme without interfering, it will prove to you that you are the source of all my failures!"
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"A little loose here, Perry the Platypus. (Perry crosses his arms) No, no, you're right, by myself. Okay all I have to do is- (gets zapped, dogs are heard and chase after Doofenshmirtz off-screen)"
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, okay, okay, just this once I failed and you have nothing to do with it, but did you have to let me trip all three bear traps? Like c'mon! Why not here in the hot sun working on ways to get us back to Danville (They both stop walking and look at each other) and you never offered me so much as a glass of water or or a teatanus shot! I'm going it alone. As a matter of fact, I'm sick of you and your smug face! I don't wanna see it any more. I'm going to close my eyes and count to 3, (covers eyes) and when I'm done, you better be gone. (Perry already disappears) And it'll be just like when you're here except that YOU (Points to where Perry is last seen) won't be here! (Counts) 1...2...3! (Open his eyes) Hey! He really.... FINE THEN! I can find the bus station on my own."
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(crawling; pants) I said I wanted a sea otter for Christmas, they said I have to pick my present from the bottom shelf of the kitchen cosmics aisle at the supermarket so I bought an oven cleaner. I love that oven cleaner. OVEN CLEANER!! (notices a bus station) Hey, a bus station!"
3,61,Bus Driver,Danville's at point's east! (Doofenshmirtz stands up) Tickets please!
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(pants) I don't have a ticket for the... I've got to get to Danville to be in a play and I just gotta, I don't have any money, I'm tired and dirty and it's all my fault, I've.. It's always been my fault! I'm a failure, I'm a failure! (begins to cry off-screen) (while crying off-screen) I'm a failure."
3,61,Bus Driver,So... no ticket?
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(while crying) I'm a failure. (Perry shows up with two tickets in hand, he stops crying) Two bus tickets? (Grabs the tickets) Oh Perry the Platypus, you're mench. I know I can be testy and unpleasant, I know I tend to ramble on and on, to be fair, the burden of conversation is kinda all on me in our relationship. And I know that I haven't always given you the respect you deserve, anyway, I want you to know that you are appreciated Perry the Platypus. You. Are. Appreciated. Oh, hey now, check it out. Look, see? A tear. The universal secretion for sincerity. (Doofenshmirtz catches his tear in a phial) Come on. You can have a window seat."
3,61,Driver,Hold it! No animals allowed!
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,Tough break. Thanks for the ticket though.
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,Sweet! It's air conditioned in here!
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(To nobody in particular) It's not like I wanted to go to the desert. He just jet-packed into me and dragged me along. No animals on the bus, it's no my rule. It's company policy. It's not my fault."
3,61,Passenger,Are you talking to me?
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"And what does he expect, he my nemesis. I'm a stone-cold villain. I'm ruthless. I have no ""ruthes"". ... Still he looked so sad and pathetic when the bus pulled away, and-- AH, I should think of something else. Kreplach! Kreplach! Eastern European comfort food. You like kreplach?"
3,61,Passenger,"As a matter of fact I do. When I was a little girl, my grandmother and I would make kreplach. First we would roll out th--"
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,Enough of your blabbering on and on! My little nemesis is out there all alone. I can't believe it! Stop the bus! Stop the Bus! Stop-
3,61,Passenger 2,What's going on?
3,61,Passenger 3,Hey what gives?
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,I can't believe it.
3,61,Doofenshmirtz,Enjoying the shade Perry the Platypus? It's your jetpack! I found it stuck in the mouth of a fiberglass dinosaur I mean how often does that happen when you really need it? Climb aboard. Come on! Come on! Hahaha.

3,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Are you trapping me? But we were getting along so- (Perry motions towards the turbo switch) The turbo switch!? Are you kidding? I can't control this thing at that speed. O-Okay Perry the Platypus, if you think so... (Perry throws the switch)"
3,61,Rodney,"Oh well Doofenshmirtz, the show must go on, without you. ...And there's my cue."

3,61,Buford,That was amazing! I never thought quilting could be so much fun! Think of the possibilities! Needlepoint! Embroidery! Tapestry! I'm headin' down to the fabric store right now! (walks away) Broquet! Taffeta! Saddle stitch!

3,49,Candace,Which means I'm in charge.

3,49,Irving,"Hello, Candace. Are Phineas and Ferb here?"
3,49,Candace,Yes. (closes door. A knock is heard. She opens it and Irving reappears) Yes?
3,49,Irving,Can I see them?
3,49,Candace,Probably not from there. (Closes the door again. Another knock is heard. She opens it.)
3,49,Irving,I would like to visit with my friends Phineas and Ferb. Could I please come in?
3,49,Candace,"Well, why didn't you say so?"
3,49,Irving,(walks in with a tablet device in his hand) I am sure you would like to know what it is I am holding in my hands.
3,49,Candace,Nope.
3,49,Irving,"Well, if you insist. Behold, the Ultimate Phineas and Ferb Digital Scrapbook! UPAFDS for short. (Pronounced as ""Up-af-ds"")"
3,49,Candace,Up-a-feds?
3,49,Irving,UPAFDS!

3,49,Irving,"Yeah, see? (He flips through the device, which includes photos of the rollercoaster, Candace's head on Mt. Rushmore, the chariot race, the treehouse robots, and the rocketship to space) It's everything they've done over the summer."
3,49,Candace,It's perfect! Could I just borrow that for a—
3,49,Irving,Foo-foo-foo-foo-foo! The UPAFDS does not leave my person!

3,49,Phineas,Cool! Let's see!
3,49,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"(on TV) We interrupt Horse in a Bookcase to bring you this breaking news bulletin. Little Crikey the Crocodile has gone missing. Kids everywhere remember little Crikey the Crocodile from his popular show, Little Crikey the Crocodile."
3,49,Hobo Dan,"I dunno, I just thought it would be nice for Crikey to take a ride, get some fresh air. Uh, but a couple of speed bumps later, badda-bing, badda-boom, no Crikey! I just hope he's okay."
3,49,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"Search parties are looking in the swamp areas in Danville, but nobody has seen any sign of him."
3,49,Phineas,"They're wasting their time in that swampy marsh. Everyone knows crocodiles head for the sewers. That's where we need to look. Tiny Crikey needs our help. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
3,49,Irving,"Ferb, I know what I'm gonna do today, too!"
3,49,Candace,"Yes, Ferb, I know what I'm gonna take today—I mean borrow—I mean—"
3,49,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
3,49,Ray Liotta,"Good morning, Agent P. I know what you're thinking: ""Aren't you Hollywood's Ray Liotta?"" The answer is yes. Yes, I am. I'm sitting in for my good friend, Major Monogram, while he's getting some manscaping done. I mean, mustaches like that, they don't just happen. Besides, I owe him big for that favor he did for me at...the Academy."
3,49,Young Monogram's Voice,"Hey, uh, Ray, I...I just did a favor for you."
3,49,Young Liotta's Voice,"Thanks, Francis. I owe you big."
3,49,Ray Liotta,"Anyway, our web monitors tell us that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been frequenting websites and blogs dedicated to chickens and chicken-related jokes. We don't know what that means, but it's gotta be something fowl. We need you to get out there and take him down a peg! (Perry salutes) Good luck, Agent P! (Perry leaves and Liotta laughs) That felt great, Carl! Fighting evil like that, I was like zing, wow, yeah! Why did I ever drop out of the Academy to become a big Hollywood star when I'm needed here?"
3,49,Carl,"(offscreen) Well, to be fair, sir, you do get paid more than we do."
3,49,Ray Liotta,"Yes. Yes, I do."
3,49,Candace,So tell me exactly how you plan to catch this crocodile.
3,49,Phineas,Simple. We'll use the Crocolocator. See that blip straight ahead of us? That's Crikey.
3,49,Candace,What's that other dot?
3,49,Phineas,"Oh. Well, apparently, there's buried treasure down here. Eh, maybe some other day."
3,49,Irving,This is so exciting!
3,49,Candace,"So, Irving, (taking the UPAFDS) maybe I should keep this safe while we—"
3,49,Irving,"(swiping it back) Foo-foo-foo-foo! I am sorry, Candace, as much as I have great reverence for you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person...EVAH!"
3,49,Candace,"Oooh, all I wanna do is show it to Mom!"
3,49,Irving,"Oh! Well, sure. As soon as we're done with the mission, we can show her to your mother."
3,49,Candace,"Really? I can just show her to—Wait a minute, did you just call it a ""her""?"
3,49,Irving,"Yeah, ""her"", see? (falsetto) ""Hi, Candace, I'm the UPAFDS! And I'm a girl!"""
3,49,Candace,"Anyway, as soon as we're done finding this little crocodile, it's straight to Mom with the evidence! (to her brothers) Come on! Move it move it move it!"
3,49,Phineas,"That's the spirit, sis!"
3,49,Candace,"You guys are going down, down, DOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!!!!!"
3,49,(Cut to,)
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Who is it? (Perry chatters on the intercom) Oh, Perry the Platypus, come on up. (He pushes the door button and giggles to himself and sneaks behind a chair. He peers from behind to laugh again. Perry opens the door and runs in. Doofenshmirtz jumps from behind the chair with a remote.) Aha! (He pushes the button and a net falls down on him.) Okay, I chalk that up to poor planning...again. (gives Perry a newspaper) Anyhow, look at this. Can you believe it? My goody two-shoes brother is getting an award for being the best Danville mayor ever for the second year in a row! And he's only been mayor for one year! I am going to make sure he never gets that award! Uh, you see, people used to laugh at me all the time. I know it's hard to believe now, but it's true. They would laugh at me. And would they laugh at my brother? No! Never! Of course not! Well, things are about to change. Thanks to my brand new Chicken-Replace-inator!"
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"This beautiful device replaces anything it hits with a chicken! How funny will that be? Roger gets handed the award, and suddenly, it's a chicken! Ha ha! And not just chicken, but the nearest chicken! Which, when you think about it, saves a lot of energy. I mean, why pull some chicken from halfway around the world when, uh, there might be one available right around the cornerrrrrrruh? (takes off the net and throws it onto Perry) Ah, this is much better. Anyway, like I was saying, all I have to do is point this at Roger just as they're handing him his award, and zap! He goes from prestigious mayor with a major award to just some guy holding a chicken. I mean, have you ever seen anyone not laugh at a chicken? Chicken laugh! Chicken laugh! It's obligatory."
3,49,Phineas,The Crocolocator says he should be right here. Maybe there's some other way to track him.
3,49,Candace,"Phineas, puh-leez. I'm all the equipment you'll ever need. I mean, hello, let us not forget that I wrestled a ferocious alligator. (Unbeknownst to her, a giant crocodile appears behind her.) A scrappy little crocodile is nothing for a pro like me. (to the crocodile behind her) I'n' that right? (Her eyes pop in sudden realization)"
3,49,Ferb,Oh. Looks like Little Crikey grew up.
3,49,Phineas,She must be getting a bigger net.
3,49,Irving,We're gonna need another boat.
3,49,Phineas,"(on his walkie-talkie) Isabella, execute Plan B!"
3,49,Isabella,"Roger that, Phineas! We're on our way! Okay, girls, let's light 'em up!"
3,49,(Song,"""Subterranean Crocodile Apprehension Expedition"")"
3,49,Phineas,"Nice short cut, we're right behind her. Hey, what happened to Buford and Baljeet?"
3,49,Baljeet,Come on! She is getting away!
3,49,Buford,"Gimme a second. If I eat nine, the tenth one is free!"
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, yes, there he is. The second he takes that award, bazing! There it is. It's chicken time, baby! (Perry throws the net back onto Doofenshmirtz) The net? Again? (takes it off) Really? You know somethin'... What are you doin'? (Perry hits the inator with a wrench and breaks the pedestal) Careful with that! (Doofenshmirtz catches the inator) Perry the Platypus, you are gonna get such a chickening! (He zaps the wrench which is replaced by a chicken.) Ah! (He zaps something down below. Cut to a posh old lady with a dog. The dog gets replaced by a chicken. The lady laughs. Doofenshmirtz zaps it again. It zaps a car, which gets replaced by a giant chicken. The man in the car laughs. A crossing guard is then replaced by a chicken. Two boys crossing laugh.) I hope you're noting this, Perry the Platypus! Chicken laugh! Chicken laugh! See?! I told ya!"
3,49,Phineas,"Candace, aim your boat for the middle tube!"
3,49,Phineas,"Candace, you did it!"
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, come out, come out, wherever you are. You've got an appointment with the nearest chicken. I've got something that I need to— (He gets startled as he sees Perry standing in front of him) Now, prepare to be turned into a— (Perry takes out a rubber chicken) Huh, what is that? A rubber chicken? (Perry puts the rubber chicken into the inator's beak) What are you gonna do with... Actually, that's kinda funny. No matter! Prepare to meet your chicken! (He activates the inator, which starts to inflate and overheat) What the heck's wrong with this? Oh boy."
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no!! (Kaboom! We hear massive clucking inside)"
3,49,Farmer's Wife,"I don't believe it! I go to the store for fifteen minutes and when I get back, I find that you've turned our Nearest Chicken Farm into a swap meet!"
3,49,Farmer,"And what did you buy, dear?"
3,49,Farmer's Wife,"Frozen lasagna. They were on special two for one, so I bought two, I figured we could have one tonight and then we could have the other one when your sister and her husband...Ah d-don't change the subject!"
3,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, look, it's chickens! It's (groans) I guess chickens aren't as funny as I thought."
3,49,Phineas,"Wow, Candace, that was fantastic! The way you handled the boat and brought Crikey to safety! You are one pretty awesome big sis!"
3,49,Linda,"Hi, kids! Hey! How did Crikey get here? They must've brought him in while I was at lunch. Candace, why are you sitting on a chicken?"
3,49,Candace,"(runs out) Wait right here, Mom! I've got evidence!"
3,49,Linda,But why was she sitting on a chicken?
3,49,Phineas,"I don't know, Mom. (chuckles) It's actually kinda funny."
3,49,Linda,"Yes. Yes, it is."
3,49,Candace,(running up to Irving and grabbing the UPAFDS) Hehehehehehe... Give me that nerd box! I'm tired of being nice!
3,49,Irving,"No way! I told you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person eveeer!!!"
3,49,Candace and Irving,Oh no!
3,49,Candace,"You ate my evidence, you overgrown lizard!"
3,49,Phineas,"There you are, Perry!"
3,49,Candace,I just can't believe it's gone!
3,49,Irving,"Aw, don't be blue. All we've gotta do is wait a couple of hours—"
3,49,Candace,"Ew, disgusting!"
3,49,Irving,"What? My brother will be here with my backup. What were you think— (realizes) Oh, that is disgusting!"

3,12,Stacy,"I'm coming as fast as I can, Candace! I'm at your house. Now, what kind of emergency are we dealing with? A parent emergency? A Phineas and Ferb emergency? Oh my--"
3,12,Candace,(has an unusual hairstyle) Ahhhh-ha-ha! AHHHH!
3,12,Stacy,"A hair emergency: the worst kind! This is awful! How did--? Wait, what are these 4 long streads, and look at this shaved areal! What's that all about? Is this a rolled-up sock? Candace, who did this to you?"
3,12,Candace,"Stacy, it was ME, I did it to myself."
3,12,Stacy,Why?
3,12,Candace,"Jeremy's mom is hosting a benefit for endangered animals this afternoon, and I wanted a new look!"
3,12,Stacy,So you want your hair to look like an endangered species?
3,12,Candace,"No, there are all these How-To videos online. They make it look so easy."
3,12,Lady in Video,"Just brush it up, toss your head back, and viola! It's simplicious."
3,12,Candace,It's not simplicious! It's hard-plicious!
3,12,Stacy,"Candace, take it easy."
3,12,Candace,Look at me! (Lies on laptop keyboard) A tragic victim of Internet hair stylists!
3,12,Stacy,"Sorry, I don't think there's anything I can do, but there are a couple of guys who could..."
3,12,Candace,"No, no way!"
3,12,Stacy,"Uh, are these chopsticks?"
3,12,Candace,"Ugh, all right. PHINEAS AND FERRRB?!"
3,12,Phineas,What do you think? We been working on our spit takes all morning.
3,12,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, you're hilarious. Listen, I need you two to get me out of this situation."
3,12,Phineas,Why? Your hair is simplicious!
3,12,Ferb,Have you tried tossing your head back?
3,12,Candace,"Look, I don't have time to explain. Just get me back to the way I was."
3,12,Phineas,"Okay; yeah, but I think you're making a mistake."
3,12,Stacy,"Hey, where's Perry? What, I'm like the only person who's never said it."
3,12,Major Monogram,"Good afternoon, Agent P. For the past few days, our motion sensors have detected Dr. Doofenshmirtz rummaging around in his basement. So, last night we had Carl stake down there behind his water heater."
3,12,Carl,It was horrible down there!
3,12,Major Monogram,Carl!
3,12,Carl,I saw a rat give birth... to a snail!
3,12,Major Monogram,Just tell him about Doofenshmirtz.
3,12,Carl,"Doofenshmirtz kept coming down and grabbing pieces of his old Inators from cardboard boxes. Oh no, brown recluse spider's favor dwelling in cardboard boxes! (Major Monogram touches him in the ear; He shrieks) Get it off! Get it off!"
3,12,Major Monogram,Get out there and find out what Doof is up to. (At Carl) Seriously Carl? What a baby.
3,12,Carl,I think it laid eggs in my ear!
3,12,Phineas,"So by combining ultra-violet and infrared waves together with follicle stimulation properties, not only does it style your hair, but it stimulates and accelerates new hair growth! So that should take care of that little shaved area. (at Stacy) What's that all about?"
3,12,Stacy,Don't get me started.
3,12,Phineas,(at Candace) All you have to do is sit there for thirty minutes on setting five and you're good to go.
3,12,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, tick-tock."
3,12,Phineas,"Start her up Ferb. (at Candace) Remember, thirty minutes on setting five."
3,12,Candace,Thanks guys!
3,12,Stacy,What was that?
3,12,Candace,"Oh, I changed my ringtone. That's a tangerine orangutan. Endangered animals! (looks at her phone) Oh, it's Jeremy! (she picks it up) Hi. You're uh, picking me up in ten minutes? Great! (nervous laugh) Bye. (hangs up the phone) Ten minutes! Stacy, crank this thing up. If it takes a half an hour on five it should do the trick in ten seconds on twenty."
3,12,Stacy,"I don't know Candace, maybe you shouldn't mess with-"
3,12,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it'll be fine."
3,12,Stacy,(nervously) Ok.
3,12,Candace,"Besides Stacy, they wouldn't put a twenty on it if it weren't meant to be used, right?"
3,12,Stacy,Well...I guess so.
3,12,Candace,"Oh, my ten seconds are up! (lifts the top part of the machine from her head) Well, how does it look?"
3,12,Stacy,(gasps) I can't believe it! It's perfect!
3,12,Candace,Told you it'd be fine.
3,12,Candace,"Ooh, now help me find something cute to wear."
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus I don't like your tone. (plays dramatic chords on the organ) Behold...I give you...The very VERY BAD-INATOR!"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"It's made up of only the most evil parts of my old Inators, cobbled together without any rhyme or reason. My plan is to load it on my floating platform, take it high above the Tri-State Area and, you know, turn it on and see what it does. (turns towards Perry) I have no idea but I'm sure it's gonna be bad. Hence, Very Bad-inator. (pretends to shiver) Ooh, I got a chill!"
3,12,Candace,"(walking into the museum) Wow, nice turnout."
3,12,Jeremy,Yeah.
3,12,Candace,"Hey, there's your mom."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"There you two are! Don't you look nice, Candace."
3,12,Candace,"Oh, thanks Mrs. Johnson."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"Come on, I'll show you where we're sitting. (she begins to lead them to the table) We have a very good turn out this year, many of Danville's top zoologists are here."
3,12,Scientist #2,"(to Scientist #1) I bet I'll have more species named after me than you do, care to make a wager?"
3,12,Scientist #1,No.
3,12,Scientist #2,Why not?
3,12,Scientist #1,Because your last name is Pithicus.
3,12,Scientist #2,(laughs)
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,The money that this banquet raises will go a long way to facilitate solutions for the problems these poor animals face.
3,12,Candace,(through clenched teeth) Great!
3,12,Jeremy,"Uh, Candace, I think you've got a little food or something on your lip."
3,12,Candace,(covering her mouth with her hand) Will you excuse me for a moment? (runs off to a table with an elderly couple sitting at it) Umm I just need to see this spoon for a- (uncovers her mouth and sees the mustache growing on her face and screams. She then hides under the table.)
3,12,Candace,(on the phone) Phineas.
3,12,Phineas,Oh hi Candace. (at Ferb and Linda at the dinner table) It's Candace. (at Candace) You turned it up to twenty? So what happened?
3,12,Candace,(mumbles are heard from the phone)
3,12,Phineas,No way! That is so cool.
3,12,Candace,(mumbles are heard from the phone again)
3,12,Phineas,"Ok, I'll see what we can do. (he hangs up the phone) Mom, may Ferb and I be excused? Candace needs help with her hair."
3,12,Linda,So you guys are hair stylists now?
3,12,Phineas,Apparently.
3,12,Linda,"So, what would you do with my hair?"
3,12,Phineas,"Nothing, it's perfect the way it is."
3,12,Linda,"Wow, you are good."
3,12,Phineas,"Girlfriend, please."
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"(on the flying platform) Be careful Perry the Platypus, you're awfully close to the edge. Oh! Let me help you back. (laughs as Perry is sent from one side of the platform to the other) I'm just messing with ya."
3,12,Jeremy,Candace! Candace? Now where'd she go?
3,12,Candace,I gotta find a better place to hide. (Candace moves the table away from the elderly couple)
3,12,Old Man,(making magic fingers) Ooohhhh.
3,12,Old Lady,Oh stop it.
3,12,Old man,You've lost your joie de vivre.
3,12,Scientist #1,"Wow, this thing keeps getting weirder every year!"
3,12,Professor Jones,(practicing his speech) It is wonderful to see such a fine turnout- AAAH!
3,12,Candace,(looking at her hair covered hands) AAH!
3,12,Scientist #2,"(on stage) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's lecture!"
3,12,Jeremy,(calling Candace) Where did she go?
3,12,Scientist #2,Won't you all please help welcome...
3,12,Candace,Oh no!
3,12,Scientist #2,Professor Herbert Fordsworth Weatherman Jones!
3,12,Jeremy,Uh...
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"That's not professor Herbert Fordsworth Weatherman Jones, that's the rare tangerine orangutan! We have to capture it and return it to the wild. (getting up from the table) Stand back everyone, I have an associate's degree in zoology, I got this."
3,12,Candace,Oh no! Jeremy's mother! She can't see me like this!
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,(chasing Candace down hallways) Don't run away! I mean you no harm!
3,12,Candace,(now in a fossil exhibit) AAH! (she climbs up the bones of a T-Rex to reach the window outside and climbs out)
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"No no no! Don't go up there, don't go up on the roof! (at Jeremy) Jeremy, would you do me a favor and call animal control please?"
3,12,Jeremy,"Sure thing, Mom."
3,12,Phineas,"Hey Ferb, look up there! That's Candace on the roof. And I was worried this function would be dull. (he calls Candace)"
3,12,Candace,(on the phone) Phineas help! Jeremy's mom thinks I'm an orangutan and is trying to return me to the wild!
3,12,Phineas,"Ok, hang tight. We brought the hair remover."
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"This looks like the perfect spot to fire up the Really Bad-inator. (taps on the control panel of the machine) I can't wait to see what it does. Guess we'll have to wait. Ooh I brought snacks. (walks over to the picnic basket) Let me see what I have here. (rummages through the basket) Baby carrots, some grapes, and a- ooh, peanut butter! Ooh, and some honey! See, Perry the Platypus, most people like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but I really prefer peanut butter and honey."
3,12,Phineas,Very few people know that Myron's discus thrower was made with real ancient disc-throwing action.
3,12,Phineas,"Hang on Ferb! (pushes a button on the statue with his foot, sending the arm of the statue spinning) Wwwweeeee!"
3,12,Phineas,Candace? Ferb and I made a sonic oscillator. This baby'll blow the hair of a peach at ninety yards.
3,12,Candace,"Great, get this hair off of me."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"(opening the window to the roof) Yoohoo! Little friend, where did you go?"
3,12,Phineas,Come on Ferb.
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,I see you!
3,12,Animal Control Guy,Animal control. You got a monkey that needs tranquilizing?
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"That is not a monkey, it's the very rare tangerine orangutan."
3,12,Animal Control Guy,"(loading the darts into the tranquilizer gun) Yeah yeah, tomato potato. Just leave it to the professionals. (he cocks the tranquilizer gun and fires at Candace)"
3,12,Candace,AAH!
3,12,Animal Control Guy,"(seeing the dart in his backside) Huh. Would you look at that. Well, you probably noticed that I'm ah...not that good at my job so...you can just take this and I'll be right back. (he passes out)"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh yes. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches. The trick is the honey, and you get to use one of these weird honey-spoony things."
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Playtpus, did you just say gungalingdung?"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Aww, great! Now I'm sticky. (he gets up while Perry goes to the controls) Aww, no, and this was my last clean lab coat too. Ugh it's on now!"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey! Hey, hey! What are you doing? Ooh I get. Payback. Very funny, Perry the Platypus. You're very mature."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"(reading the instruction manual for the tranquilizer gun) Thank you for purchasing the Hanson 3000 Family Friendly Tranquidart Air-contrast delivery system, there are many like it but this one is yours."
3,12,Candace,"Phineas, hurry, while she's distracted!"
3,12,Phineas,"Alright, Candace."
3,12,Candace,Hey it worked!
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"As soon as I get this honey off of me, I- (Candace's hair hits Doofenshmirtz, sending him off of the platform and onto the pole where Candace once was.)"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,Is this hair?
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no! Now I'll never know what the Bad-inator does! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"The red plunger will act as a non-return valve and retain the air within the dart. Fear not helpless primate, for I will return you to the wild, or my name isn't Hawk-eye Johnson! (aims; tranquilizer gun cocks; shoots)"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"(screams) Oh, man. Shot in the butt with a dart, while covered in honey and hair? Well, what do you know, my horoscope was right. (hugging pole) Oh, my beautiful, beautiful horoscope."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,"Oh, no! What have I done? She's going to fall!"
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"(drowsily) Hold the door, Barbra. I think this is our floor. (falls)"
3,12,Candace,"Thanks, guys! I could just hug you! (proceeds to hug her brothers, but ends up catching a hair and honey-covered Doofenshmirtz instead)"
3,12,Phineas,Awesome!
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,Candace? You caught her! You saved this orangutan!
3,12,Animal control guy,I'll take it from here. (grunts) Leave it to the professionals.
3,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Mama, I'm pretty."
3,12,Mrs. Johnson,I knew you were a good catch.
3,12,Candace,Thanks Mrs. Johnson.
3,12,Jeremy,I didn't know you were helping out my mom. You made quite an impression on her.
3,12,Candace,"Well, I guess you could say I am having a good bad hair day."

3,9,Tykera,(on TV) That's right.

3,9,Candace,"I do stuff! Uh-oh, call waiting. Bye! (presses a button) Hi, Jeremy."
3,9,Jeremy,I just called to let you know I'll be at the big pet wash at the park today.
3,9,Candace,Pet wash?
3,9,Jeremy,"Yeah. Instead of cars, we wash pets for charity. You know, you can really..."

3,9,Jeremy,I was saying you can really tell a lot about a person by the way they treat animals.
3,9,Candace,True.
3,9,Jeremy,"Hey, why don't you bring Perry to the park and we can wash him together? Sound like fun?"
3,9,Candace,"Yeah. Okay, see you there. (closes cell phone) Oh, Perry! Come here, you little meat brick."
3,9,Phineas,"Ferb, I've been thinking. Since there's nothing more fun than fun, why no add fun to everything?"
3,9,Phineas,"Fun shoes, fun oatmeal,..."

3,9,Major Monogram,"Where's Agent P? You set off the wrist beacon, right, Carl?"
3,9,Carl,"I'm worried too, sir. So I thought I'd make myself useful by modifying his chair. I added a hidden button so the chair will automatically go to Doofenshmirtz's. Then automatically return here. (laughs) Everything's Agent P sized here. It's kind of cute, like kindergarten."

3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"(uncovers his ears; turns around) Perry the Platypus, you escaped already?"
3,9,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
3,9,Phineas,Whee! Wall slide's working.
3,9,Buford,"Hey, Dinnerbell, where do you want the clown head?"
3,9,Phineas,"Clown room. (at Isabella) Hey, Isabella, how's that hall of cookies coming?"
3,9,Isabella,"Great, but I had to double the recipe."
3,9,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, how's the basement spin?"
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, down on all fours! I know that fighting technique. (gets down on all fours) It's Singapore Crab! I learnt in Hoboken. (moves back and forth; stands up; imitates a crab) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna sidewalk all over you, baby."
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,(on TV) ...maybe repaint the kitchen.
3,9,Major Monogram,"Take note, Carl. You're watching a master agent at work. (eats some popcorn)"
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're in for it."
3,9,Carl,"Get him, Agent P!"
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"A fake-out, eh? (gets out from under the fallen display stand) Okay, Perry the Platypus, the claws are off now. From here on in, I fight the man style!"
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,(muffling) Okay. I see you found the brick wall.
3,9,Major Monogram,"Oh, the Marsh Maneuver. Well, I haven't seen one of those since 1974."
3,9,Carl,1974? You had a perm back then.
3,9,Major Monogram,"Stay off the Internet, Carl."
3,9,Candace,(grunting; takes out Perry from tub) Here's cuteness!
3,9,Jeremy,(holds out towel; water drips off of Perry) That little guy's just drowning in mother love.
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"What's the matter, Perry the Platypus? Don't they feed you at the agency?"
3,9,Jeremy,"Wow, Candace, you sure know your pet."
3,9,Candace,"That's me. Now that we're here, can I offer you a... (opens back door)"
3,9,Jeremy,"A fun house? Man, your brothers are cool."
3,9,Candace,"Oh, yeah. I'm sure."
3,9,(Song,Funhouse)
3,9,Phineas,"That was some fun, huh, Candace?"
3,9,Candace,"No, not fun! Not fun."
3,9,Linda,(from outside the house) Candace? Boys? Come help me with the groceries.
3,9,Candace,"I stand corrected. (leans out of her bedroom window) Mom, Phineas and Ferb built a giant fun house inside our house!"
3,9,Linda,I'll be right there. I just gotta get the groceries.
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, wait a minute. I've been going about this all wrong. I should be zapping you with the Least-Likely-inator so you'll lose! But first, I gotta get this sandwich out of the way."
3,9,Doofenshmirtz,Typical. (groans) I should've zapped myself.
3,9,Candace,"But, Mom! Phineas and Ferb built a... (gets zapped by the ray) Urrgh!"
3,9,Candace,Why am I doing this?
3,9,Linda,"So, where's this fun house?"
3,9,Phineas,Candace cleaned the whole thing up before you could see it.
3,9,Linda,You cleaned up the whole thing before I could see it?
3,9,Candace,Yes.
3,9,Linda,"Well, that seems unlikely."
3,9,Ferb,"Yes. Yes, it does."
3,9,"Major Monogram, Carl",Surprise!
3,9,Major Monogram,Congratulations! Astounding work.
3,9,(Song,Funhouse)
3,8,Linda,"Hey boys, want some fat-free whole-grain granola bars? They're still warm from the oven."
3,8,Phineas,Whole-grain and fat-free? (He and Ferb take a granola bar) You know us so well.
3,8,Linda,"(Walks off) Yes, yes I do."
3,8,Phineas,"You know, Mom's always doing nice things for us. I think it's time we did something nice for Mom! Let's see... We could—No..."
3,8,Phineas,Or—Uh uh.
3,8,Phineas,Huh...
3,8,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?"
3,8,Phineas,We're trying to think of a nice thing we can do for Mom. Any ideas?
3,8,Isabella,You can clean up the whole house for her!
3,8,Baljeet,"Or, you can get a classic wooden slide rule from Analog Emporium."
3,8,Buford,"How do I know what adults like? What am I, a computer?"
3,8,Phineas,That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make a super computer!
3,8,Buford,What? Your Mom wants a super computer? What is she? Some kind of nerd?
3,8,Phineas,"No, we're gonna ask the computer what to do for Mom."
3,8,Baljeet,Slide rule! I gave it to you on a silver platter!
3,8,Linda,"Okay, I'm going out. (Pulls out a coupon) I've got a coupon for a free hair styling from this new salon. I'm gonna freshen up my look. Granola bars are in the kitchen! (walks away)"
3,8,Candace,"Ugh. Maybe I'll feed mine to Perry. Hey, where is Perry?"
3,8,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. The entire Tri-State Area's becoming riddled with holes. Also, numerous light beams have been shot from Doofenshmirtz's building. Either he's having some sort of a rave, or he's the one behind all those holes. Investigate at once! (Salutes) Good luck, Agent P!"
3,8,(Song,Buildin' a Supercomputer)
3,8,Supercomputer,And that's the story of how you made me.
3,8,Isabella,He's cute!
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,(Repeatedly firing his ray) That's not it... That's not it...
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,That's not it... (Picks up an item) That is not it.
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,That's not it.
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs) Welcome, Perry the Platypus. How do you like your trap? That's super quick drying cement. See? (Knocks on the cement) Solid as a, uh... I dunno, some rock-like substance. Cement, maybe! Now, with you safely trapped, I introduce you to the Metal-Unearth-inator! (The Metal-Unearth-inator fires, and a can comes back)"
3,8,Phineas,"All right, gang, It's ready to go. We just need to perform an initial scan of the Tri-State Area so it has enough data to work with."
3,8,Supercomputer,Scanning the Tri-State-Area.
3,8,Boy,"Between that and the random laser drills, this is like the second best mid-day scrapyard rave ever!"
3,8,Doctor,"(Preparing to activate a CT scanner) Hold still and... (The red scan light flashes, showing her skeleton. She pulls out her cell phone) Hello, Hospital Workers Union."
3,8,Norm,Get out of my mind!
3,8,Supercomputer,"Gathering data from all objects and habitants. Computing all logical outcome of all events. (Finishes scanning, bell dings) Done."
3,8,Phineas,"Okay, computer. Are you ready to answer any question?"
3,8,Supercomputer,"Yes, my data is complete. My logic, infallible."
3,8,Phineas,What's 2 + 2?
3,8,Supercomputer,4. Perhaps you should just count on your fingers.
3,8,Phineas,"Sorry. What's the square root of 72,361?"
3,8,Supercomputer,269. Try something more unusual.
3,8,Isabella,What are the names the girls in my Fireside Girls troop?
3,8,Supercomputer,"Gretchen, Adyson, Holly, Katie, Milly, and Ginger."
3,8,Isabella,"Wow, he's good!"
3,8,Baljeet,"On a multi-valve engine with variable timing, how can I isolate an exhaust valve leak at the stem seal without removing the can shaft?"
3,8,Supercomputer,Coat the engine with tomato paste and the leak will reveal itself.
3,8,Buford,"He's right! Uh, what size pants do I wear?"
3,8,Supercomputer,"Boys, husky, extra large."
3,8,Baljeet,He's right!
3,8,Buford,Impressive! (Thumbs up)
3,8,Phineas,"Well, you seem to be working perfectly so, computer, what is the nicest thing we can do for Mom today?"
3,8,Supercomputer,"Computing... (Ding) Done. Get a gallon of industrial marking dye and a leaf blower. Tie balloons onto them. Then, go to the top of Danville Hill, and at 2:37 p.m., release them into the wind."
3,8,Phineas,Really?
3,8,Supercomputer,Nothing would make your mother happier today.
3,8,Baljeet,You turned that slide rule for this?
3,8,Phineas,"I don't know, Baljeet. From what we seen so far, I think a little blind faith is called for."
3,8,Baljeet,You know nothing about women.
3,8,Buford,"Dude, it's over."
3,8,Candace,"Okay, there must be something bustable going on around here. (Notices the super computer. She drops her phone) What...is..that?"
3,8,Supercomputer,I am a super computer. I can answer any question that you can possibly ask.
3,8,Candace,Did my brothers make you?
3,8,Supercomputer,"Yes. Yes, they did."
3,8,Candace,"Okay. So, let me think of a question... Hmm... How many states in the United States?"
3,8,Supercomputer,50.
3,8,Candace,What goes on top of pancakes?
3,8,Supercomputer,Butter and syrup.
3,8,Candace,"How do you pronounce the ""J"" in ""Jalapeño""?"
3,8,Supercomputer,"It makes the ""H"" sound."
3,8,Candace,(Hisses) I knew that. How many fingers behind my back?
3,8,Supercomputer,Two.
3,8,Candace,"Okay, that's just freaky. And...bustable! All I gotta do is... (Pause) But it never works! No matter what I try, whatever the boys do just disappears before Mom looks! If only there was some way to guarantee Mom would see what the boys done? (Looks at the supercomputer) Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee..."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"What? Another one? Why are there so many helmets buried in the Tri-State Area? (Tosses it off) Ah, onto the pile you go."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"So, Perry the Platypus, hope you didn't come here because of the holes, because the Metal-Unearth-inator is not even my final plan. May I present to you my real plan? The All-Purpose-inator! You heard of a man's man? Well, this is an inator's inator. (His hand is seen on the control panel) It does everything! (Takes his hand off the control panel) Of course, once I activate it, it will make all my inators obsolete, but, uh... I guess that's progress. Unfortunately, I ran into a little snag..."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"After putting all the final touches on my All-Purpose-inator, I took a step back to admire my handiwork. Victory was finally within my grasp."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,All I needed to do is turn the thing on. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz pulls out a key) Then fate made a cruel joke. (Flashback Doofenshmirtz slips on green paint. The key falls off the balcony) The ignition key fell of my balcony!
3,8,Flashback Doofenshmirtz,"Nooooooo!!!!! (With binoculars, he spots a gopher take the key and run into its hole)"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"I could tell he was laughing. You know, that way gophers do. And there's no way I was going to go all the way down there to get the key. I've got a schedule to keep."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"So, I decided to build the Metal-Unearth-inator to track down and dig up the key so I can fire up my All-Purpose-inator..."
3,8,Candace,"But then, when I bring Mom into the backyard, it's gone and Mom never sees it. So here's my question, Mr. Supercomputer, how can I get my Mom to see what my brothers have done?"
3,8,Supercomputer,Elementary. You must build a device that makes your Mom see what your brothers have done.
3,8,Candace,What kind of device?
3,8,Supercomputer,"Follow my instructions to the letter and when you have finished, I am 100% certain that your Mom will see what your brothers have done."
3,8,Candace,Okay. Where do I start? (pulls out a notepad and a pencil)
3,8,Supercomputer,"(while Candace is writing) You are going to need a toaster, a number two screwdriver, some electrical tape..."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Helmet, helmet, another helmet. What happened here?"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm closing in on the key. I can feel it. (gasps) Perry the Platypus, how did you get out?"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasps again) Well, two can play at that game."
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(chuckles; awkward silence) Uh, wait a second. Hold on. (rummages in the pile) Not this, not this. There was a whole bunch of 'em just a couple of minutes ago. A-ha! Jackpot!"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, Perry the Platypus, meet your doom. (screams)"
3,8,Phineas,"Keep up, Buford, it's almost 2:37."
3,8,Buford,"Hey, I don't have balloons to lighten my load."
3,8,Baljeet,I would have walked.
3,8,All,"Three, two, one... (Phineas and Ferb releases the items into the air) Liftoff!"
3,8,Phineas,There they go. Industrial orange marker dye and a leaf blower. Guaranteed happiness for Mom. Somehow. Let's follow and see what happens.
3,8,Phineas,"This way, everybody."
3,8,Baljeet,"Sure, now you put me down."
3,8,Candace,"There, finished. Did I put it together right?"
3,8,Supercomputer,"You built it perfectly, Candace. Your Mom will definitely see what the boys have done. And you finished it just in time, because in two seconds your Mom is going to pull up."
3,8,Candace,Wow! You're right about everything! (runs off) I can't lose! (to Linda) Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mo...
3,8,Linda,I'm having a bad day.
3,8,Candace,"Uh, never mind. Come on, come on, come on. (pushes Linda towards the backyard)"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"So, no so tough without your mace. (Perry glares at him) Now, I have the upper hand. (Perry takes off the helmet) Prepare to meet your doom... (He holds up the shield after Perry throws it at him.) You throw your helmet at me? That's so lame, Perry the... (Perry starts throwing helmets at him.) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
3,8,Supercomputer,Precisely on schedule.
3,8,Supercomputer,Hello gopher! (the wiring detaches from it)
3,8,Candace,(pushes Linda into the backyard with eyes closed) It's over here! It's over here! See?
3,8,Phineas,"Hi, Candace!"
3,8,Linda,"You know, Candace (turns around) most days, this is just a little disturbing. But today, with the free coupon (camera pans up) and this whole awful thing with my hair..."
3,8,Supercomputer,And the gopher lets go now.
3,8,Linda,(with eyes closed) If only I had...
3,8,Linda,(groans)
3,8,Linda,(opens her eyes; looks in the hand mirror) Huh?
3,8,Linda,My hair looks so...cute! I guess it just needed some time to settle. (walks away)
3,8,Candace,"But, but, but, buuuuuu..."
3,8,Linda,"It's so great when something nice happens to you, especially when you weren't expecting it. (exits)"
3,8,Candace,What just happened?
3,8,Phineas,We did something nice for Mom. We fixed her bad hairdo. Apparently.
3,8,Candace,You did that?
3,8,Phineas,Yup.
3,8,Candace,You... did that?
3,8,Phineas,That's right. With a little supercomputer help.
3,8,Candace,"So, when Mom looked in the mirror on that thing I built, she saw what you had done?"
3,8,Phineas,That's right.
3,8,Ferb,"And by the way, nice use of the accordion arm."
3,8,Candace,Oh! I hate computers! (exits)
3,8,Phineas,"Hey, where'd the computer go?"
3,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh! The key detection alarm! I forgot I installed that. (tosses the sword and shield) Here it comes,..."
3,8,Supercomputer,I knew this was going to happen.
3,8,Doofemshmirtz,Uh-oh.
3,13,Linda,"(to Candace) So you and Stacy are going to a ""Rock-n-Roll"" memorabilia auction?"
3,13,Candace,"(to Linda) Well, yeah. They are gonna be auctioning off one of the original Tiny Cowboy bobble heads. (Flicks the Cowboy hat bobble-head) The lefty one."
3,13,Linda,So I guess I won't be seeing you at the annual Danville Meatloaf Festival?
3,13,Candace,No. What's a Meatloaf Festival?
3,13,Linda,"Oh, that's right! You were away at camp last summer when I won this! (takes out ""Meatloaf Queen"" crown)"
3,13,Candace,Meatloaf Queen? (doubtfully) Wow. That's pretty fancy.
3,13,Linda,"(puts crown on) And because my meatloaf was voted best at the festival last year, I have the honor of being one of the judges this year."
3,13,Candace,"So, you have the honor of eating other people's meatloaf all day?"
3,13,Linda,Yup. I'm living the dream!
3,13,Phineas,What happened?
3,13,Buford,"We were just...at the bounce house...down at the Meatloaf Festival...and...and I was there, you know, having a good time, and suddenly..."
3,13,Buford,Later!
3,13,Buford,Dude! Gotta go!
3,13,Buford,"And even though it was funny, I still kinda wish that the bounce house was still there. You know, for the little kids."
3,13,Phineas,Buford's right!
3,13,Buford,I am?
3,13,Phineas,"Even though they're made for little kids, there's something about a bounce house that you can't resist. What if bounce houses were made for bigger kids?"
3,13,Buford,Hey!
3,13,Phineas,"Slightly bigger kids. And what if they just happened to be totally amazing? I stand before you today and I hereby declare that...that, uh, little help, Ferb?"
3,13,Phineas,"That nobody has yet done justice to the bounce house concept, and that it is up to us to show the world what a bounce house can truly be. For if not us...then, who? If not now...when? And if not when, then...something else! Gentlemen, I know what we are going to do today! But first answer me this: Where's Perry?"
3,13,Phineas,"No, seriously, where is he? I don't...I haven't seen him."
3,13,Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. We've recently found surveillance footage of Doofenshmirtz buying fresh produce. We've concluded there are two possibilities. Either he's up to something sinister that is food related, or he's cooking dinner 'cause he's got a beautiful woman coming over and he wants to imp...never mind, it's obviously the first thing."
3,13,Baljeet,Very impressive.
3,13,Phineas,"Just a little bit more, Ferb."
3,13,Phineas,That's about right.
3,13,Linda,"Wow, Jamie Oliver. I can't believe we've got one of England's most famous chefs for our little Meatloaf Festival."
3,13,Jamie,Brilliant! It's a pleasure to be here.
3,13,Linda,"Yes. This year we've expanded our venue. We have twenty-nine meatloaf flavored ice cream, as well as various meatloaf-themed attractions and rides."
3,13,Jamie,"So, what exactly is ""meatloaf""?"
3,13,Linda,"Oh, it's made of meat, it's got bread and onions."
3,13,Jamie,Ah! So it's a beverage.
3,13,Linda,"Well, no. But it's sort of like shepherd's pie, except there's no potatoes or vegetables in it. You know, in the shape of a loaf."
3,13,Jamie,You put pepper in it?
3,13,Linda,If you want.
3,13,Jamie,"Oh, meatloaf!"
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha ha ha, welcome, Perry the Platypus! I never thought you'd fall for the old ""distract Perry the Platypus with a weird bird"" trap. I gotta say though, it's uh...it's quite an ugly bird. And now, for something a little more confining. (puts Perry in a clear box) You like it? It's biodegradable. A biodegradable trap. You know how everyone says, ""if you don't like meatloaf, it's probably because you haven't tasted my meatloaf""? Well, it's true, because mine really is the best!"
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"In fact, I come from a long line of great meatloaf chefs. The recipe was first created by my great, great grandmother Gretel Doofenshmirtz, who passed it down to my grandpa, José Doofenshmirtz, weird story there. Then he passed it down to my mom, who passed it down to...Roger. Ugh! Naturally, I had to steal it from him. And when I did, I finally found out what the secret ingredient was. The secret ingredient was hate. Usually it's love, but Great Grandma Gretel had some issues. With this recipe, I'm sure to win the Danville Meatloaf Festival! But just in case, I have the Rotten-inator! With a quick blast of this, my competitors' meatloaves will be completely rotten! My victory is guaranteed!"
3,13,Buford,"Oh, man! This is awesome!"
3,13,Phineas,And that's not the half of it. We're gonna fill it with helium. (turns on a helium machine)
3,13,Baljeet,Hey Buford! We are going to float like little woodland pixies!
3,13,Buford,"You're never gonna let me live that down, are you?"
3,13,Phineas,"Okay, everybody, let's bounce."
3,13,Buford,Way ahead of ya!
3,13,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
3,13,Auctioneer,The next item up for bid is this lovely Mona Lisa reproduction made entirely out of recycled guitar picks from the Paisley Sideburn Brothers. Shall we start the bidding at $10?
3,13,Candace,(to a posh woman) Excuse me? May I borrow these for a moment?
3,13,Candace,"Thank you! (looks through the glasses and sees the kids) Phineas and Ferb?! (at Stacy) Stacy, I'm gonna skip over my dramatic agonizing about whether I can resist the urge to bust my brothers and, I'm just gonna give you my $70, my auction paddle, and tell you to do the best you can to get that bobble head. (gives the woman back her opera glasses) Oh, here."
3,13,Posh woman,Thank you.
3,13,Candace,Seriously? Who brings opera glasses to an auction?
3,13,Posh Woman,I'm at an auction?
3,13,Candace,"(dials phone) Talk to me, Stacy! How we doing?"
3,13,Stacy,"Okay, Candace, this is all the money you gave me, so this is my final bid."
3,13,Auctioneer,"$70. Do I hear 75? $70 going once. 70 going twice. Oh, wait, we got 75 from the weird guy in the back."
3,13,Candace,"Noooo!!! (splashes through fountain and coughs) Stacy, I found 37 cents! Raise the bid! Hello? Oh, stupid non-waterproof cell phones!"
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"And with this garnish, I leace nothing to chance. Ha ha ha! The meatloaf is complete. (doesn't see Perry escape) Ooh, there's the judges. I'd better zap that guy's meatloaf. (tries to zap the meatloaf but zaps Perry's box, rotting it) I rotted the trap? OH, I should've never made that out of biodegradable materials! Stupid Mother Earth! (Perry punches him) For that, I'll turn you rotten, then perhaps you'll stop annoying me! (repeatedly fires the Rotten-inator)"
3,13,Cucumber saleslady,"Fresh cucumbers! (the cucumbers get zapped, and she changes the sign) Fresh pickles!"
3,13,Old man,"This novel is so riveting. (the novel gets zapped) Oh, what a rotten ending."
3,13,Milk man,Here's some refreshing milk.
3,13,Girl,Eww! It's curdled!
3,13,Milk man,"Well, I can fix that, here's a spoon."
3,13,Buford,Hey! We're over the Meatloaf Festival! Anybody else hungry?
3,13,Chef,I don't know. It still needs something.
3,13,Candace,It need paprika.
3,13,Chef,"Well, how much?"
3,13,Buford,"Time to eat! (slides down the rope, hanging on the end)"
3,13,Phineas,Buford's pulling us down.
3,13,Baljeet,How is that possible? He weighs no more down there than he did up here!
3,13,Ferb,It's probably best not to question.
3,13,Phineas,"Oh, boy, meatloaf on a stick? Let's go."
3,13,Buford,You guys go ahead. I'll catch up with ya.
3,13,Phineas,"Okay, see ya in a few!"
3,13,Baljeet,"Buford, what are you up to?"
3,13,Buford,"I got something I need to do. (to the kids from earlier) Hey, shrimplets! I've got something for you."
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, aren't you getting tired of this? Hold still! I'll --"
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"OH, NO! MY MEEEATLOOOAAAF! You know, I've noticed how often my inators hit things that I never intended them to hit? It's quite often..."
3,13,Doofenshmritz,"Perry the Platypus, give me that back."
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"AHH! Oh, and you had to put it on ""puree"", didn't you? CURSE YOU, PERRY THE PLATYPUS!"
3,13,Linda,"All right, Jamie, how about this booth?"
3,13,Jamie,UGH!
3,13,Linda,Ew! This is rancid!
3,13,Jamie,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but some kind of preservatives in this meatloaf would've been a blessing."
3,13,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait a minute. Disqualified? OHHH! It can't possibly be that bad, let me try it. (eats meatloaf and moans) Yes, someone's gonna have to...call the...paramedics, I think."
3,13,Baljeet,"Buford, I have never seen this side of you before. I am very proud."
3,13,Buford,Yeah...
3,13,Baljeet,I retract my former statement.
3,13,Buford,Shall we be going? (carries Baljeet) Yep! (laughs)
3,13,Balthazar,Get him!
3,13,Linda,"Hi, Candace. Eww! What have you got all over you?"
3,13,Candace,"A late entry. Okay, Mom, I've been dragged all over town by Phineas and Ferb's Mega Bounce House, which you'll probably never see, but the worst part is, I didn't even get my Tiny Cowboy bobble head!"

3,11,Lawrence,"It's the new, digitally remastered third series of Pinhead Pierre! (boys bounce down on a large inflatable ball) Only the best series ever and my most favorite show ever. That's all."
3,11,Phineas,You had us at come quick.
3,11,Pinhead Pierre,"Hi kids! (kids applaud and cheer) Kids, sometimes when your head is this small, you just want to get away for a bit. You know, escape from all the laughing and pointing. Whenever I feel like that, you know what I do? Magic carpet ride! Roll out your official Pinhead Pierre rugs, kids!"
3,11,Lawrence,"Right-o! (runs to get it) It's been at my bedside all these years! (pushes coffee table over) Hop on, boys! (all sit on rug) We're about to take off on the ride of a lifetime!"
3,11,Pinhead Pierre,What's the magic word?
3,11,Lawrence,Streptococcus!
3,11,Pinhead Pierre,Whoa! Whoa! We're flying!
3,11,Lawrence,"Here we go, boys!"
3,11,Pinhead Pierre,(showing obviously fake birds and clouds) And look out below! It's Paris. There's the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower! And there's the Colosseum?! What's that doing here?!
3,11,Linda,"Lawrence, can you look at these tile samples with me? I want to re-do the living room."
3,11,Lawrence,"(sadly) Oh well, I suppose it wasn't quite as thrilling as I remember. Carry on, boys."

3,11,Major Monogram,"(wakes up; clears throat) WRONG PANTS! Huh? Oh, sorry, Agent P. Guess I was, uh, dozing there. Anyway, it appears Dr. Doofenshmirtz has completely cleared the Tri-State Area out of all grape juice, red wine, chocolate, marinara sauce, India ink, and, worst of all, (holds up mug) coffee! So, uh, go and, uh, you know, do the thing, that thing... Sorry. I'm just no good until I have that first mug o' Joe."
3,11,Candace,"I try and I try and I try and I try, but no matter what I do, things never work out like I planned! (Stacy is starting to fall asleep listening to her) Maybe if I knew how things were gonna turn out, I could plan for that and then do the right stuff! I know. I know. That doesn't make any sense, does it?"
3,11,Stacy,"You said it, sister. Have a cookie. (throws fortune cookie at her)"
3,11,Candace,"(sighs) I guess it's too much to expect some magic answer to all my problems. (breaks cookie) Let's see. ""Somebody close to you will take a trip."" Boy, I hope they take me with them."
3,11,Waiter,"(trips on cookie on the ground, which is what Candace's fortune said) I'm okay!"
3,11,Candace,"Ha ha! That was great. What a dumb coincidence. (breaks another cookie) Let's try another. ""You'll know the truth when it hits you."" OK, boring."

3,11,Lawrence,"Well, nostalgia's got nothing on this!"
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. Just in time. (pulls cart) Our flight is about to leave. Behold, the Stain-inator! What's it for, you ask? I'll tell you on the way."
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,It began in Gimmelshtump when I was a callow youth yearning for a career in fine art.
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,"' (Narrating) I quickly discovered that although I loved painting, (Shows young Doof ripping his painting in half) my muse was sometimes... inaccessible. (shows him lying on bed, depressed) Then one day, just as I was about to give up in frustration, inspiration struck."
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,"But today, I will finally get my revenge! You see, my brother, the honorable mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz, will be unveiling a new piece of art for the lobby of City Hall. Hence the Stain-inator, hence revenge, hence, uh... (Perry slowly wheels himself and his trap to the edge of the jet) no more hencing. That's about it."
3,11,Lawrence,"I say, boys, you can barely feel the road! It corners like a dream! Pinhead Pierre, eat your heart out!"
3,11,Phineas,What do you say we take the gang for a spin?
3,11,Isabella,(gasps) Wow! (takes his hand)
3,11,(Song,Aerial Area Rug)
3,11,Lawrence,"Ah, thank you, boys, this was lovely."
3,11,Ferb,"And does anyone else want to be ""king of the world""?"
3,11,Phineas,"Ah, keep it, bro. It suits you."
3,11,Candace,"Okay. Here we go. ""You choose the path that few others dare travel."" Done and done. Come on, Stace! Follow me! (runs ahead)"
3,11,Stacy,"Really, Candace? What to you hope to accomplish by this?"
3,11,Candace,Everything! Don't you see? All the problems in my life can be solved through concrete knowledge of the future!
3,11,Stacy,Right; as you create a whole new set of problems.
3,11,Candace,"Oh, stop being so close-minded. (girls walking through house/apartment) For instance, what's my biggest problem?"
3,11,Stacy,You believe fortune cookies are real?
3,11,Candace,"I mean, besides that."
3,11,Stacy,You're totally obsessed with busting your brothers!
3,11,Candace,"Exactly! And with infallible fortune cookie guidance, I can accomplish that easily. (breaks cookie) Watch. ""If something seems fishy, maybe it's a fish!"""
3,11,Stacy,(sarcastically) Genius.

3,11,Candace,"Excuse me, have you guys seen two little... (fish seller throws a fish to Candace) Oof! (Candace throws the fish to Stacy)"
3,11,Stacy,Ew! Gross!
3,11,Candace,"Gross... but foretold, Stacy. Preordained! What's next? What's next?!"
3,11,Stacy,Better be something about soap.

3,11,Woman,Thank you!

3,11,Roger,"(addressing a crowd on the front steps of City Hall) Thank you, friends, and welcome."
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,(climbing back onto the Stain-inator) Right on time.
3,11,Roger,It fills me with great pride to contribute today to the cultural enrichment of the Tri-State Area. I've always been a great lover of the arts.
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Liar, liar, pants on fire. (Perry starts attacking Doofenshmirtz from behind) Yah! You again? (Doofenshmirtz presses a button on the remote) There. Auto-fire in 30 seconds. Nothing can stop it now."
3,11,Roger,"You see, the greatest painting I ever saw was made by my brother Heinz."
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,You'd better believe it! Art killer.
3,11,Roger,"And I, in an extraordinary act of clumsiness, destroyed it, denying him the accolades he so greatly deserved."
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,And here comes the payback...!
3,11,Roger,And that's why I've spent the last two decades restoring it to its former glory.
3,11,Doofenshmirtz,"What? Huh, what? (rapidly pressing the remote) No no! No no! No no no no no no... OH NOOOOOO!!!!"
3,11,Roger,"Ladies and gentlemen, (removes the cover from the painting) my brother's painting! (a purple stain ball immediately hits the painting)"

3,39,Doofenshmirtz,"(as Perry jet-packs onto the balcony and hides in the rafters) Maaaybe.....but it also helps me visualize my scheme, it doesn't have to be used with dolls.....all the time. A-anyway, this is our headquarters, larger for the sake of clarity, and this, see this right here? This is my Sculptinator. This part will scan my body, and this part will shoot a beam which will then carve Danville Mountain into a lifelike statue of me! (lifts up the model of the mountain to reveal a model of a statue of him, but the statue has a lot of muscles) Visible for literally miles in every direction! Not scale miles, real miles. And then, when people see this splendid tower of manliness, they will just assume that I should be their leader. Look! Look how it captures the manly thickness of my neck."

(Switch to show Perry hiding in the rafters, looking deeply uncomfortable) I'm sure he'll be along. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets a load of you."

3,38,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz was spotted this morning leaving this building with a shopping list. On the list were four items: eggs, vitamins, ice and leeks. Innocent enough until you realize, it is a recipe for...evil. Get out there and make sure he never serves that dish."
3,38,Candace,Whoa. Did you just feel something?
3,38,Linda,"Morning, hon."
3,38,Candace,"Mmm, that smells good. I'll get the plates out."
3,38,Linda,"Well, put out ten, because I was talking to Jeremy's mom earlier, and we thought it would be fun to get us all together for brunch this morning."
3,38,Candace,"Wait. So the whole Johnson family, and our whole family, together?"
3,38,Linda,Yeah!
3,38,Candace,"Mom, this is the first time both of our families have formally gone together!"
3,38,Linda,"Honey, relax. It's just a casual brunch. No big deal."
3,38,Candace,"No big deal? I'm Jeremy's girlfriend! We have to make a good impression! Breakfast is easy! This is brunch! Brunch! That's so fancy! Mom, what does this frittata say about us as a family?"
3,38,Linda,There's nothing wrong with my frittata.
3,38,Candace,And a frozen orange juice?! Really?! (dumps orange mix into a pitcher of water and pants) I can't breathe. Where do we keep the paper bags?
3,38,Linda,"(at Phineas and Ferb) Hey guys, I know you ate earlier, but you wanna join us for brunch?"
3,38,Candace,No! No! No! They'll embarrass me!
3,38,Phineas,"Aw, we can't mom, we're on our way to the hardware store to pick up some extra parts."
3,38,Linda,Okay two less plates then.
3,38,Candace,"Good! Is this house even clean enough for this? (Picking up a few magazines) Let's see, monster trucks on the bottom, book review on top. That should impress 'em. (She looks out the window, and sees Phineas and Ferb's personal anti-gravity device) Oh no! No! No! That is hideous! What the heck did the build out here? (Reading) ""Anti-gravity maximus"" Oh I have got to get rid of this thing. (She begins to pulls it away, but the machine zaps her, making her float in the air) Oh no. No! N- Ahh! Phineas and Ferb! Not today! Not now! If Jeremy's parents see me like this, that's the end of me seeing him. Come on there's got to be a reverse switch on this thing."
3,38,Phineas,"Excuse me sir, Where do you keep the reverse switches?"
3,38,Store employee,Right behind ya'. Next to that guy buying self destruct buttons.
3,38,Candace,Oh my gosh. They're here.
3,38,Linda,"Candace, my hands are full, can you get the door?"
3,38,Candace,"I'm on it mom. (Candace works her way across the lawn, keeping herself grounded to the best of her ability)"
3,38,Jeremy,"Well, Suzy. Are you excited to see Candace."
3,38,Suzy,Yes. I love Candace.
3,38,Candace,"I'm coming. Just a few more feet. (she opens the door for the Johnson family) Jeremy, and the whole family, welcome to our humble dwelling."
3,38,Mrs. Johnson,Good morning Candace. Where's your mom?
3,38,Candace,She's in the kitchen Mrs. Johnson. It's right through there.
3,38,Mrs. Johnson,"Okay, here we go."
3,38,Candace,"Oh, it's just so nice to see you, I just can't stop hugging you."
3,38,Phineas,Anytime you're ready Ferb.
3,38,Isabella,"(As she walks into the back yard) Hey Phineas, what'cha doin'?"
3,38,Phineas,Hey Isabella. We're blasting this pile of trampolines with an anti gravity machine. So we can bounce all over town.
3,38,Isabella,Why not blast ourselves with anti-gravity?
3,38,Phineas,"Well, then we couldn't bounce. Blast 'em Ferb."
3,38,Phineas,"Come on guys, Follow me!"
3,38,Buford,(With a tear in his eye) It's beautiful!
3,38,Baljeet,Buford?! You are crying!
3,38,Buford,"(He removes the tear off his eye and puts it on Baljeet) No, I'm not, you're crying!"
3,38,Doofenshmirtz Recording,"Good morning Perry the Platypus. I had to step out for a moment, but please, help yourself to some gnosh. Eggs, vitamins, ice, or leaks. I have no idea what you platypuses eat, but whatever you do, don't destroy my new evil -inator. (Perry takes a nearby sledge hammer and go to destroy the -inator, however, Perry's feet get trapped in braces) A-ha! You're trapped! A-hahahaha Sucker!"
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Do you like it Perry the Platypus? It's my new Tell-the-Truth-inator! One blast from this baby, and people will be forced to tell the truth. It features an Abe Lincoln robot. He doesn't actually serve any functional purpose, he just decoration. He's, he's thematically linked to honesty. Y-You know through his nickname ""Honest Abe"". But enough about me, let me ask you this. Have you ever wondered what it is that holds the fabric of society together? No it's no cooperation, or trust or any of that stuff hippies want you to believe, it's lies. All the little white lies we tell each other. For you see Perry the Platypus..."

(She finds a wrench, and shoves it in her shoe, weighing her down somewhat) OJ, did you now that stood for Orange Juice, cause I didn't. Well, its not fresh, but it was an impromptu brunch. Brunch cross between breakfast and lunch, makes you wonder what a late night snack would be. A lack? How about a rack? Cross between dinner and snack, anyway... Haha, enjoy."
3,38,Baseball Announcer,It's a beautiful day for a ball game!
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,(On his flying platform) But it won't be a beautiful day for long. Not after they all start tell the truth about each other. I'll start with that hotdog guy down there. Wait 'till the world hears what's in those things. And fire!
3,38,Vendor,"Hotdogs, get your hotdogs! (He gets zapped) They're aren't really any hotdogs in here, I just wanted to get into the game for free."
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Huh, I didn't see that one coming. Let's just see what the players have to say."

3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Let's see what embarrassing truths that women who's holding that unusually large hand mirror has to say. (He fires, but the rays bounces back and hits Doofenshmirtz) Secretly I'm very lonely. Where did that come from?!"
3,38,Phineas,How 'bout some lemonade?
3,38,Candace,"(bursts into the garage) There you are, this is all your fault! That machine of yours has made me lighter than air!"
3,38,Isabella,"I just mentioned that, I thought it would be so fun to--"
3,38,Baljeet,Not a good time for that.
3,38,Candace,"I'm trying to make a good impression on Jeremy's parents, (Suzy peeks around the garage door, and listens in on the conversation) and I can't even keep my feet on the ground!"
3,38,Phineas,I guess we should install that reverse button now. We wouldn't want you bouncing off the ceiling during brunch.
3,38,Ferb,That would be a little rough on the old frittata.
3,38,Candace,Just hurry before I make an even bigger fool of myself
3,38,Abe Robot,It is all together fitting and proper that I must destroy Doofenshmirtz.
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,No! Get back! Ahhh!
3,38,Abe Robot,Must destroy Doofenshmirtz.
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(While hiding behind Perry) He's gonna John Wilkes my Booth! (a beat) What, to soon?"
3,38,Candace,"So, Mrs. Johnson, it's so great to talk to each other like adults. (Suzy crawls under the table, and pulls out the wrench weighing candace down) Just me and you talking all adulty and stuff, and (Candace notices her leg has floated up) WHOA! (She floats up entirely, just managing to hold onto the table) Ahh! Just doin' a little yoga stretching to help this digestion, yep."
3,38,Linda,Good thing she's wearing her skort.
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, do something! He's going to emancipate my proclamation!"
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(While bouncing) What's up Honest Abe? Looks like the old Doofster's a little too, smart for y-- (The Abe Lincoln robot grabs Doofenshmirtz from the air) Oh, hehehe, hi, you."
3,38,Candace,(Still hanging on by the table) Hahaha! Did I ever tell you I'm thinking of taking gymnastics next year? Haha!
3,38,Jeremy,Awesome.
3,38,Suzy,(Still under the table) Gymnastics? How about aerobatics?
3,38,Candace,"Ow! Ow! O-Oh my gosh. Well, uh, that's enough gymnastics for now. (She manages to sit back down, and wrap her leg around the char, grounding herself)"
3,38,Suzy,"Candace, can you juggle with this?"
3,38,Candace,"No! put that down. Suzy that's my 1984 collectable Ducky Momo plate, where they printed the entire design upside down. It's priceless."
3,38,Suzy,"Mmm, oh whoops. (She throws the plate)"
3,38,Candace,"(In slow motion) Noooooo! (She manages to catch it with her mouth, while keeping herself from floating away, by grabbing onto Mrs. Johnson's Head with her feet)"

3,38,Mrs. Johnson,"Oh, and now you're telling lies."
3,38,Candace,"Ugh, Mrs. Johnson, as much as I hate to admit it, Suzy's not lying. Phineas and Ferb made a ray that makes me weightless. I might as well show you I couldn't embarrass myself more than I already have."
3,38,Phineas,"Reverse switch, check. Is it aimed at Candace? Close enough. (He fires the ray)"
3,38,Candace,"Look. (She removes her hands from the table, but gets hit with the ray, making her crash down) Ta da...!"
3,38,Jeremy,"So dad, what do you think?"
3,38,John,She's a lot like your mom.
3,38,Doofenshmirtz,Curse you Honest Abe Lincoln!

Perry uses his free tail to launch fruitcakes at Doofenshmirtz) Not fruitcake! (The first one misses; the second hits Doof in the mouth, and he falls down.

3,15,Candace,"There they go again... their machine mocking me... (imitating Phineas) ""Oh, hi, I'm Phineas! Ferb and I are gonna do something totally bust-worthy!"" (in her own voice) ""Yeah, like what? A submarine that'll go into my esophagus?"""
3,15,Stacy,"Candace, what are you doing?"
3,15,Candace,Nothing. Did you bring the hypnotism stuff?
3,15,Stacy,"If you mean the pocket watch, then yes. Why do you want to do this, Candace?"
3,15,Candace,"I have to meet Jeremy in the park today, but I can't go unless I get this busting out of my head!"
3,15,Stacy,But hypnotism? It's just so 1843 of you.
3,15,Candace,1843?
3,15,Stacy,"You know, 1843 when James Braid published the ""Rationale of Somnambulism"" in which he invented the term ""hypnotism"", named after the Greek god, Hypnos."
3,15,Candace,(In a stunned tone) How do you even know that?
3,15,Stacy,It's written on your poster. Apparently he also invented the comb-over. Freaky.
3,15,Candace,(Still stunned) Why would I have bought that poster?
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"(to Perry) Oh this is terrible, look at her, look what I've done. (Gestures at Vanessa sitting on a chair at the balcony) She's been giving me the cold shoulder ever since she overheard something out of context. This is like one of those sitcoms where somebody says something that's misconstrued and the snooty next door neighbor got the wrong package delivered after his in-laws come to visit, somebody has two dates at one night and they have to paint white lines on the middle of the room, but this isn't a sitcom, Perry the Platypus, this is real life. (pauses, as he and Perry glanced at the fourth wall) And... I'm... And I'm the father, and I have to treat her with the respect that she deserves in a caring fatherly fashion. (pause) I'll blast her with one of my inators! Wait here (goes to drag the inator) You like it, Perry the Platypus? I built it for the 170th anniversary of the Alamo, but I forgot to use it! It makes people forget about what they're thinking right at that moment, call it the Forget-About-It-inator! Heheh, I love that name. (starts trying out different tones) Forget about it. Forget about it. Forget about it! Haha, forget about it! (to Perry's face) Forget about it! (turns to Norm) How 'bout a handshake, (swings his hand) forget about it!"
3,15,Norm,(as he leaves) If only I were a real boy.
3,15,Stacy,(in a slow voice) You are nooooow entering a deeeeep sleeeeep...
3,15,Candace,(monotone) Deeeep sleeeep...
3,15,Stacy,"What? Sweet! It's working. Candace, when you hear the trigger word, um, (cut to poster that says ""Holy Guacamole"") ""holy guacamole"", you will no longer have the desire to bust Phineas and Ferb."
3,15,Candace,No more busting my brothers...
3,15,Stacy,"And when you hear (cut to poster that says ""Leapin' Lizards"") ""leaping lizards"", it'll make you return to normal."
3,15,Candace,Return to normal...
3,15,Stacy,"Now, when I snap my fingers, you will awaken with no recollection of being hypnotized. Do you understand, Candace?"
3,15,Candace,No...
3,15,Stacy,No? What's not to understand?
3,15,Candace,A brief recap might be helpful...
3,15,Stacy,"Candace, ""holy guacamole"" - no busting, ""leaping lizards"" - back to normal. (Snaps fingers and Candace comes out of hypnotic trance.)"
3,15,Candace,"I don't know, Stacy. I don't think it worked. I still want Phineas and Ferb to go down, down, do-"
3,15,Stacy,(Interrupting Candace) Holy guacamole.
3,15,Candace,What was I talking about?
3,15,Stacy,I think you're ready for you're date with Jeremy.
3,15,Candace,Ooh! Who's Jeremy?
3,15,Stacy,Uh-oh. I think something went wrong.
3,15,Candace,I'm just kidding.
3,15,Stacy and Candace,Ahh!

3,15,Candace,Before I rush off to bust Phineas and Ferb?
3,15,Jeremy,Well...
3,15,Candace,"Jeremy, I no longer have the desire to bust my brothers. We can take our time. (A lizard hops by. Candace notices it.) Whoa, look at that."
3,15,Jeremy,(Laughs) What do you know? Some sort of reptile hopping around. Hi little hopping reptile. Hi little jumping chameleon. Hi little springing salamander.

3,15,Vanessa,"(Removing headphones) Did you say something, dad?"
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,What? You're wearing headphones? So you haven't heard a thing I've said all day?
3,15,Vanessa,Why do you think I wear the headphones?
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,So you're not mad at me for saying I'd rather have a son than a daughter like you.
3,15,Vanessa,What?
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, nothing, nothing. Just put these back on. (Puts headphones back in her ears.) There you go."
3,15,Vanessa,Whatever.
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"(Walking back to Perry and his Inator) What about that? She didn't hear me. I'm still a great dad. And the sitcom cliche has been resolved. I guess I didn't need this inator after all. Say, here's a thought. How about if I blast you instead?"
3,15,Norm,"Sir, I just want you to know that I've always thought of you as my father."
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Look, Norm. This is going to have to wait. I have to blast Perry the Platypus and I'll be right with you."
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"(To Norm.) Now, who are you?"
3,15,Norm,I am ... your ... son! (Pause) Yeah!
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, really? (Turns to Perry) And what's that?"
3,15,Norm,"Don't worry, Dad, I'll get rid of it."
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Funny, I don't seem to remember much."
3,15,Norm,"You like playing ball with me, your son."
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,Really? I like that?
3,15,Norm,Yes.
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,What else do I like?

3,15,Phineas,"Candace, do you want to go for a ride?"

3,15,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
3,15,Candace,You see it! You see it! (The invention takes off) Phineas and Ferb are busted for sure.
3,15,Linda,Where's it going?
3,15,Candace,"Oh, it'll come back down in just a little bit. Just in time for me to get my bust on."
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"So what's this thing do? Ooh look, buttons! (Pushes buttons) Pushy, pushy! (Green ray comes out of inator)"
3,15,Candace,"--it comes down, that's great. We can bust Phineas and Ferb and be done in time for dinner."
3,15,Linda,"So what did you want to show me, Candace?"
3,15,Candace,"Uum, that."
3,15,Linda,Good heavens! What is that?
3,15,Candace,"Like I said, Phineas and Ferb built it and its-- (Invention takes off again)"
3,15,Linda,Where's it going?
3,15,Candace,"It'll be back. And then it's busting time for sure, right Mom?"
3,15,Linda,"Alright, Candace. So what was it you wanted to show me?"
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"This is fun. Pushy, pushy, push the buttons. I'm pushing the buttons."
3,15,Norm,Sir. Sir.
3,15,Linda,"Alright, Candace. So what was it you wanted to show me? (Invention lands.) Holy guacamole! What is that?"
3,15,Candace,Wait! Why did I leave Jeremy in the park? (Runs off.)
3,15,Linda,"(Noticing Perry.) Oh, there you are, Perry. (Perry chatters.)"
3,15,Norm,Sir! It's overheating and it could-- (Inator explodes.)—explode.
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey! Wait a minute. You're not my son. You're that walking junk pile, Norm."
3,15,Norm,But dad!
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,And I am not you're father. I'm fairly sure about that.
3,15,Norm,Bu-bu-bu-bu-but!
3,15,Vanessa,"Here, Norm. (Gives him headphones.) Wear these. It helps."
3,15,Norm,"Thanks, sis!"
3,15,Vanessa,"(Sarcastic) No problem, bro."

3,15,Norm,No. Not really.
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, Norm, it occurs to me that though I've never had a son, there is someone I can always count on to be there. Someone I've begun to think of as family."
3,15,Norm,Yes?
3,15,Doofenshmirtz,"And that someone is Perry the Platypus. See you around, junkpile."

3,16,Sergei,"I will join you soon, comrades. Phineas and Ferb said I should watch the skies for a special message. (camera pans out to show space station) Those boys are so thoughtful."
3,16,Stacy,"Oh, look at it, all swollen and useless. You are one sorry, laid-up, mummy-footed bed potato."
3,16,Candace,"Why you gotta be all like that? I mean, this is serious! I can't even get down to the radio station to pick up the backstage passes and..."
3,16,Stacy,(looking out of the window) Huh! What's that your brothers are building down there?
3,16,Candace,What? (trying to get out of bed) Let me see! Let me see!
3,16,Stacy,No way. You gotta stay off that foot!
3,16,Candace,"(grunts) Wait! The video screen! .... There they are! Doing things! And there's Mom! Not noticing! Mom, Mom, turn around!"
3,16,Stacy,You know she can't hear you.
3,16,Candace,Then I'll call her.
3,16,Linda,"Hey, this is pretty good!"
3,16,Candace,"Oh, why doesn't she answer? I'm going down there!"
3,16,Stacy,No!
3,16,Candace,"Stacy, you gotta help me!"
3,16,Stacy,Okay.
3,16,Candace,Thank you.
3,16,Stacy,I am such an enabler.
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah! Perry the Platypus. You got yourself in quite a pickle there! See? 'Cause it's a pickle. And you're inside it. Anyway, backstory. It all started the other day when I was visiting Tony's Deli."
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"I had gotten a bowl of chicken soup, but it had a fly in it."
3,16,Tony,It's a raisin.
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,It's a FLY!
3,16,Tony,It's a raisin.
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"So, I took it to an entomologist."
3,16,Entomologist,It's a raisin.
3,16,Entomologist,But on the other side is a fly.
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Of course, by then my soup was cold and it was too late for a refund. But now, I will wash Tony's Deli off the face of the Tri-State Area with my new Chicken Soup-inator! (camera pans to reveal the -inator)"
3,16,Candace,"Come on, Stacy! Come on, Stacy!"
3,16,Stacy,"(on the video screen) Hey, turn around. Turn around!"
3,16,Candace,This is it!
3,16,Stacy,"(on the video screen) Yeah, I mean you."
3,16,Phineas,"(on the video screen) Oh, hi, Stacy."
3,16,Candace,What?
3,16,Phineas,(on the video screen) It's hard to hear over all the noise we're making. Is Candace enjoying the live video?
3,16,Stacy,(on the video screen) She's watching right now.
3,16,Phineas,"(on the video screen) Hi, Candace! We're waving back, but we can't see or hear you!"
3,16,Candace,(growls; texts a message on her cell phone)
3,16,Stacy,(after looking at Candace's text message) Wow! I'm surprised the spelling checker didn't catch that. (at Phineas) I've got to deliver a message to your mom.
3,16,Phineas,She's right over there.
3,16,Delivery Man,Delivery./Stacy: Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher!
3,16,Linda,"(turns around) Oh! Hi, Stacy."
3,16,Stacy,Take a look. (walks away)
3,16,Linda,"Oh, the azaleas. You can put those down over there."
3,16,Phineas,"Okay, lower it here!"
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, poor little regular platypus. Did mean old Perry the Platypus stick you in there? (releases Perry from the trap, who then punches him in the face) Hey, why did you do..."
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus! (runs toward the pile of food; grabs a bag from the pile) I don't know how you escaped or what you did with the other platypus but here, these two-day-old bagels are harder than Bessemer steel! Have a nosh!"
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"And how about some potato salad! Take this marble rye! And here's some braunschweiger! And some pickled herring! And, ooh, a red onion!"
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,A Gunter Flagendorf? But how do you know that sandwich? He only made one movie and that was back in Gimmel... (gets hit in the face with the sandwich; screams)
3,16,Phineas,Power test.
3,16,Candace,"(throwing things at the window) Mom. Mom. Mom. I may as well try that dumb remote. (uses the remote several times) Oh, yeah, I'm free as a bird. (tosses the remote away; narrows eyes then grabs the box) Okay, what else? Oh, yeah, this thing and this. Big whoop."
3,16,Mindy Mimic,Big whoop.
3,16,Candace,"(pause; gasps) Ee-ee-ee-ee... (attaches Mindy Mimic to helicopter) Mom, turn around."
3,16,Mindy Mimic,"Mom, turn around. (x3)"
3,16,Cosmonaut 1,"Oh, smile, Sergei. It is your birthday."
3,16,Sergei,I know. I was just hoping to get a message from the boys by now.
3,16,Cosmonaut 1,"Well, until then, you should join us in some fun! We are going to empty all of canteens and drink from the giant floating water ball, like ants in rain storm!"
3,16,Sergei,"Okay, okay, but just a sip."
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,What? A bathroom break? Next time go before you come...
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, how about some macaroni salad? .... Antacid? The only effective defense against deli foods. (grunts)"
3,16,Mindy Mimic,"Mom, turn around. (x3)"
3,16,Candace,"Oh, for crying out loud! (uses scissors to cut a cord; the cast falls) AAAAHHHHH!"
3,16,Phineas,"All right, guys. Sergei's space station is almost directly above us. Sing into the mic and the Stratospheric Ionizer will visualize our words!"
3,16,Phineas,Okay! A-one and a-two and...
3,16,Mindy Mimic,Turn around. (x2)
3,16,Sergei,"""Turn around""? .... Comrades, listen! Evasive maneuvers! Quickly!"
3,16,Cosmonaut 1,"Those boys, they have saved our lives!"
3,16,Sergei,And look! We found a wormhole!
3,16,All,(whooping) Yes! That is what I am talking about!
3,16,Candace,(crawling towards Linda) Mooooom! Mooooom! Mooooom! Moooo-oooom!
3,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Twelve pickles! How did you even get them all in there? (leaps at Perry, who kicks him onto the -inator) My Chicken Soup-inator! Nooooo!"
3,16,Candace,Mom! (hops to Linda and stalks her) Turn around! (the asteroid whacks the ionizer behind her) TURN AROUUUUUND!!!
3,16,Linda,"What? Oh, okay."
3,16,Candace,"See? (sees nothing is there) But, but, but, but..."
3,16,Linda,"Well, I'm glad your ankle's feeling better, dear. But you should really be lying down. And look, the kids clear out the perfect spot for my snapdragons! I think that earns you for some pie."
3,16,"Buford, Isabella, Ferb, Phineas",Hooray!
3,16,Linda,"Oh, not on the flowers, sweetie, I just planted those."
3,16,Candace,They're lovely.
3,16,Phineas,It's a shame we couldn't get that message to Sergei. I'll try calling his cell. (dials a number on his cell phone)
3,16,Sergei,"(voice recording) Hello, I'm unavailable because I'm hurtling through time, and evolving past our human limitations. So, don't bother leaving a message after the beep."
3,16,Phineas,I guess we'll never be able to wish him a happy birthday.
3,16,Ferb,"Well, never say never."
3,16,(Caption,Somewhere beyond Jupiter... And beyond time.)
3,16,Sergei,(wheezing) What the... (gasps)
3,16,Ferb alien,Happy birthday!
3,16,Sergei,They did remember. Such nice boys.
