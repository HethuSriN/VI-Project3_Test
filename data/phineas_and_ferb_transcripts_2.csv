2,27,Phineas,"I don't know about you, Ferb, but I think bubbles have a great sense of humor. Look at what that bubble's doing to my face. (laughs) You make me laugh out loud, bubble."
2,27,Baljeet,Hello!
2,27,Phineas,"Hey, Baljeet."
2,27,Baljeet,What are you guys doing?
2,27,Phineas,We're blowing bubbles and relaxing.
2,27,Baljeet,"Oh, I remember being relaxed, but that was before I had this! (shows Phineas and Ferb a schedule)"
2,27,Phineas,That looks like a color coded schedule.
2,27,Baljeet,"That's because it is. Every minute of my entire day is planned out right here. Remember how you told me to seize the day? Well, consider it seized!"
2,27,Phineas,That's not exactly what I meant.
2,27,Buford,"Hey, is it time for me yet?"
2,27,Baljeet,"Not quite. (brief pause) Okay, now. (Buford licks his finger and sticks it in Baljeet's ear)"
2,27,Phineas,Do you have any extra time for a bubble?
2,27,Baljeet,"Uh, I guess I have time for one."
2,27,Buford,"Oh, oh! Can I blow a huge one so I can crawl inside it and float around like a little woodland pixie? (stops, realizing his mistake) Did I just say that out loud?"
2,27,Phineas,"Yes, yes you did. But that actually sounds fun minus the pixie part. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! There's no better way to see Danville than from inside a huge bubble."
2,27,Buford,I wanna float around! (again realizing his mistake) Like men.
2,27,Phineas,"Wanna come, Baljeet?"
2,27,Baljeet,My schedule is extremely tight. I doubt I even have a second to answer your question. Maybe if I move my polka recital back. Okay.
2,27,Phineas,Great! So you're coming?
2,27,Baljeet,"No! I moved polka back so I could answer your question! It would take some major rearranging, but I think I can at least come and watch you make the bubble."
2,27,Phineas,"Awesome! Hey, where's Perry?"
2,27,Baljeet,Haha! Right on time! I had Perry's absence on my schedule!
2,27,Major Monogram,"Shh! Quiet, Carl! He's coming!"
2,27,Major Monogram/Carl,Surprise!
2,27,Carl,Alright!
2,27,Major Monogram,"Happy Birthday, Agent P! (blows into kazoo) (awkward pause) It's not your birthday, is it? (Perry shakes his head) Are we close?"
2,27,Carl,Told ya!
2,27,Major Monogram,"Put a sock in it, Carl! (clears throat) I, uh, was a bit too busy planning your party, so I'm not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up too, but I am sure that it's no good. Get to the bottom of it!"
2,27,Linda,"So, Candace, are you ready to do some practice driving for your permit?"
2,27,Candace,I'm easing my way into the driver's seat. I start with what's familiar and slide into the new.
2,27,Linda,Well start sliding. We've got errands to run.
2,27,Candace,"Okay, you drive!"
2,27,Linda,Your dad says you're already good at parallel parking.
2,27,Candace,That was in the backyard! That's way different than the open road!
2,27,Linda,"Candace, I thought you wanted to be the first of your friends to have a driver's license."
2,27,Candace,"Okay, I'm sliding."
2,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here. I did get your invite to your birthday party over the internet, and naturally, I couldn't go, since it was most likely a trap. Anyway, I got you this. (hands Perry a birthday card) It's just a card, but here you go. (card traps Perry) Surprise! Haha! I finally figured out why my evil schemes always fail. You see, I am totally, completely, unlikeable. No, really, so I asked myself, ""what are the two most liked things on the planet?"" The answer? Country music and western music. So now, I'm bringing them together for the first time. I'm calling it ""Country and Western Music."" I know, I know. I'm brilliant, right?"
2,27,Phineas,"Great bubble design, Ferb. Now all we need is the missing bubble ingredient."
2,27,Isabella,Hey guys. Whatcha doin'?
2,27,Baljeet,Making changes to my schedule.
2,27,Phineas,"We're building a machine to make the biggest, most durable bubble ever."
2,27,Baljeet,"Oh, right. Nobody ever asks what Baljeet is doing."
2,27,Phineas,"We have just about everything we need for our durable bubble, but if you guys wanna help out, we still need some sap from a maracanut tree."
2,27,Isabella,"Yeah, we can definitely do that."
2,27,Phineas,"Excellent! While they're doing that, we can finish the design on the transponder. See you girls back at the field!"
2,27,Doofenshmirtz,"I know what you're thinking, ""But Doof, you have a terrible singing voice! Well, feast your eyes on this little baby! (unveils a cowboy hat) Ta-da! I call it the Yodelinator! Pretty cool, eh? Oh, right. You just think it's a big cowboy hat. It's so much more! (presses a button on the hat) See? Huh? See? It's designed to make my singing voice sweet and mellifluous. So, my first gig is in an hour. Come on, you can help me hand out fliers. Everyone's going to (singsong) love me!"
2,27,Linda,"You can do this, Candace! Just look into the turn and ease your foot off the brake."
2,27,Candace,"I'm l-l-l-l-looking into the turn....(gasps as she sees Phineas, Ferb, and the rest of the kids with the bubble machine in the park) (just as a bus with two monsters on the side pulls up, blocking the view) Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb!"
2,27,Linda,"Candace, I don't find that funny."
2,27,'Candace,'No! Behind the bus! (honks horn) They were building some kind of contraption! I'll show you! (swerves left)
2,27,Linda,"Oh good. Now we're-- Candace, slow down!"
2,27,Phineas,"Nice work as usual, Ferb! All we need now is the final ingredient."
2,27,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! We got the sap you guys needed. Here! (hands him a vial)"
2,27,Phineas,"Thanks! (pours sap into bubble machine. Ferb pushes a button and turns a valve. The machine begins blowing the giant bubble, which slowly encases the gang as Phineas speaks) At this stage, the maracanut sap isn't fully congealed. So we can pass through the semi-permeable membrane with ease. (bubble walls give way and he is inside the bubble) Voila!"
2,27,Isabella,"Girls, I think we just earned our Passing-Through-A-Semi-Permeable-Membrane patches! (Fireside Girls cheer)"
2,27,Candace,"See, there they...... (they see only the machine)"
2,27,Linda,"Perhaps I should get tired of asking this, but....what am I supposed to be looking at?"
2,27,Candace,"Ugh! They were right there in the...(sees the bubble floating behind a building) Hold onto something, Mom. (floors the accelerator)"
2,27,Baljeet,"Well, that was very entertaining, but that is all the time I have scheduled for. (notices how high they are) Oh, wait. You are already airborne. And I am already still with you. (begins to panic a little) I do not believe this! My schedule is totally blown! I am going to miss my polka recital!"
2,27,Buford,I've heard you. It's a small loss.
2,27,Linda,"Candace, trash cans again!"
2,27,Candace,"Oops, heh heh. My bad. Where'd they go? (sticks her head out the window to see them floating away)"
2,27,Linda,"Candace, I think we've all had enough of your driving!"
2,27,Candace,"Not now, Mom! I have to get this car into the sky! (drives at full speed again)"
2,27,Linda,(screaming) Candaaaace!
2,27,Baljeet,"Oh, no! How long are we going to be up here?"
2,27,Phineas,(reclining) Awhile.
2,27,Baljeet,And...and how do you even STEER this thing?
2,27,Phineas,We're at the mercy of the breeze.
2,27,Baljeet,"(laughs nervously) Sure, when you say it like that, it sounds relaxing."
2,27,Phineas,Hey everybody! Downdraft! (They float down and pass under a bridge)
2,27,Baljeet,"Oh no, look out! Power lines!"
2,27,Isabella,"Girls, you know what to do!"
2,27,Isabella and the Fireside Girls,"Leeeeaaaannnn! (they all slam against the side of the bubble and it swerves, avoiding the power lines. Everyone cheers)"
2,27,Baljeet,Cactus garden!
2,27,Isabella,"Lean! (this time, everyone slams against the side and the bubble swerves into an alleyway)"
2,27,Baljeet,PUBLIC ART!
2,27,Gretchen,"With our angle of descent, leaning will be ineffectual!"
2,27,Everybody else,What?
2,27,Gretchen,We're gonna craaash!
2,27,Baljeet,Oh no! I knew I should not have forsaken the rigid beauty of my candy-colored schedule!
2,27,Phineas,The bubble is expanding. It's Baljeet's breathing! (Baljeet keeps going) It's blowing the bubble up! Everybody breathe heavy like Baljeet!
2,27,Fireside Girls and Isabella,Yes sir!
2,27,Phineas,"We're doing it! (Everyone cheers) Baljeet, you totally saved us!"
2,27,Baljeet,"When in danger, I always hyperventilate."
2,27,Cowboy singer,"Thank you, everyone! Thank you very much!"
2,27,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm next, Perry the Platypus. After this concert, I will be the most well liked man in the Tri-State Area!"
2,27,(Song,Yodel Odel Obey Me)
2,27,Person 1,I like that guy!
2,27,Person 2,Yeah! Let's do whatever he says!
2,27,Person 2,He's terrible!
2,27,Person 3,Yeah! It stinks so bad I wanna break somethin'!
2,27,Person 3,That really wasn't worth it.
2,27,Person 2,You can't mix country and western! They's two completely different types of music!
2,27,Person 4,That song was horrible!
2,27,Person 5,"Yeah, those lyrics was way too on the nose!"
2,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, that wasn't as successful as I'd hoped.... (grabs jet-pack and puts it on) but at least I can beat a hasty retreat before I'm too humiliated!"
2,27,Doofenshmirtz,"Huh? (laughs nervously) For your information, I had these way before I met you. (jet-pack shoots by and he walks away) (Halfheartedly) Okay, see you tomorrow."
2,27,Linda,"Candace, watch where you're going!"
2,27,Candace,They're around here somewhere. (she sees the bubble) Ooh! Ooh! (laughs crazily) There they are! Headed for the old drawbridge! You're mine!
2,27,Linda,"Candace, stop!"
2,27,Candace,"I can't! (the drawbridge opens and they rocket into the sky. Linda screams and covers her eyes. The bubble floats in front of them) There they are! I told you! I--Mom, open your eyes!"
2,27,Linda,(terrified) Not until we're back on the ground!
2,27,Candace,(they shoot past the bubble) Mooooom!
2,27,Phineas,That was Candace driving.
2,27,Ferb,Her car control has gotten a lot better.
2,27,Candace,"Mom, we're back on the ground! Ahhhhhhh! (eye twitches)"
2,27,Linda,"Okay Candace, now just gently...apply...the brake."
2,27,Candace,I'm tryiiiiing!
2,27,Baljeet,"Wow. This whole relaxation thing is...well, relaxing."
2,27,Linda,"Candace, at least take your foot off the gas."
2,27,Candace,"(enraged) Oh, you think? You think?! (lifts her foot) There! How's that?! Is that better!?!"
2,27,Linda,"Well, guess your father was right. You do have parallel parking down."
2,27,Candace,Look! There they are!
2,27,Linda,"Candace, I can't see anything. ""They"" who?"
2,27,Candace,"The boys! They're up in there in the -- (the bubble pops, releasing the kids onto the rides) Ugh."
2,27,Linda,"Oh, hi boys!"
2,27,Phineas,"(riding a bouncy animal) Hi, Mom! Nice parking, Candace."
2,27,Candace,"What?! No! It's not -- but they were up -- (leans on the car wheel, setting off the horn)"
2,27,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, I guess we should consider this day: Seized. (sees Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,33,Lawrence,"Hello, boys, I thought I heard a noise out here."
2,33,Phineas,"Oh, hey Dad."
2,33,Lawrence,"Say, there is something pretty peculiar going on here, now, don't tell me! You turned the entire garage upside-down, now why on earth would you do that?"
2,33,Phineas,We're searching for Ferb's favorite skateboard.
2,33,Lawrence,"(yelling to Linda) Dear! Are you aware the boys have turned the garage upside-down, looking for Ferb's skateboard?"
2,33,Linda,(offscreen) As long as they clean up after!
2,33,Lawrence,"Oh, right-o. (to Phineas) Ooh, just a minute, does that skateboard have a Union Jack on the bottom?"
2,33,Phineas,That's the one!
2,33,Lawrence,Turn the thing right-side up and come in the house. I believe I solved your mystery.
2,33,Phineas,"You heard him, Ferb. Let's turn it over."
2,33,Phineas,"So, what have you got, Pop?"
2,33,Lawrence,Take a gander what a certain old geezer posted on his blog.
2,33,Phineas,"Hey, it's Grandpa! (chuckles) Ferb, he must have left your skateboard in England the last time we were there. I know! We could create a highly intricate and sophisticated machine, that will transport any object from anywhere on the globe to our backyard!"
2,33,Lawrence,"Well, why don't you just build a new skateboard?"
2,33,Phineas,"Nah, I don't think so."
2,33,Ferb,"If it's all the same with you, Father, we're going to build the machine."
2,33,Candace,"Whoa, Mom. What's with the getup?"
2,33,Linda,"I'm on my way to join Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, at the Mexican-Jewish Cultural Fair today. Would you like to come along?"
2,33,Candace,"Let me think...um, no."
2,33,Linda,"(leaving) Oh, well, suit yourself, bubelita!"
2,33,Phineas,Let's give her a trial run. Start with something small.
2,33,Buford,"Check it out, dweebs! Betcha can't shoot this apple off my head."
2,33,Buford,"(at the camera) Hmm, not really what I meant. But, okay."
2,33,Buford,"But I still got my apple here, William Tell!"
2,33,Buford,Nice buzz cut. High and tight.
2,33,Phineas,"Hey! It worked. Now, let's try it on something more complex."
2,33,Buford,"I'm complex! Really, I'm like an onion."
2,33,Buford,Whoa. It's like there's thousands of you guys.
2,33,Phineas,Oops! (inserts another picture and presses button) I forgot to install the Fly Filter. Better try that again...
2,33,Phineas,"Sorry, Buford. Are you all right?"
2,33,Buford,I have a weird craving for something stinky.
2,33,Phineas,"He's all right. (gives Ferb a photo) Okay, Ferb, let's get that skateboard before Grandpa breaks his neck."
2,33,Reginald,What in blazes— (he tumbles backwards)
2,33,Phineas,Yes! It worked! (looks at the feet on the skateboard) Oops.
2,33,Reginald,"I say, that's peculiar. My bloomin' feet have gone missing."
2,33,Winifred,I can breathe again! (sniffs) I smell lupins!
2,33,Phineas,Better send his feet back.
2,33,Reginald,"They're back! Egad, they're facin' me 'iney! I say, ha ha, (walks around) I can get the 'ang of this! Now I can finally see where I've been! Crackin'!"
2,33,Phineas,"Now let's try out that half-pipe. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,33,Major Monogram,"Hello, Agent P. Nice entrance today. Simple and understated. I like it. Anyway, we have a situation: We recently discovered that all of the mimes in Danville Park have been trapped in actual invisible boxes. (cut to a scene of a bunch of mimes in Danville Park feeling up their invisible boxes) It took days to discover because, well, everyone just assumed they were really good mimes."
2,33,Robot Guy,I'm not even a mime! I'm a robot guy!
2,33,Major Monogram,"We're convinced that it has something to do with a new machine Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been working on. We're sending you a photo of his new inator. Oh-ho yeah! It looks evil all right. You better destroy it. Good luck, Agent P!"
2,33,Isabella,"Hey, guys, what'cha doin'?"
2,33,Phineas,"We're conducting an experiment with our mega-half-pipe and our new photo transporter. (Pan up to reveal Ferb at the top of the half pipe) Okay, Ferb, let 'er rip!"
2,33,Candace,(from her bedroom window) No way!!!
2,33,Candace,"¡Oy, carumba! I've got to tell Mom! Now where did she say she was going again?"
2,33,(Song,Mexican-Jewish Cultural Festival)
2,33,Linda,"¡Oy-lé! Candace, I'm so glad you could make it!"
2,33,Candace,"Mom, you've gotta come home right away! Phineas and Ferb...have...th-they built a...d...a thing that...that...Oh, what's the use? I'll only drive you home to find that the boys' contraption I wanna show you has inexplicably disappeared and, once again, you'll think I've lost my marbles."
2,33,Linda,"That does seem to be a pattern, doesn't it? Come on! Enjoy the festival! Here, have a dreidel-raca!"
2,33,Buford,You think your machine can find my long lost teddy bear? (flips the photo) I got his picture right here.
2,33,Phineas,"Hmmm, let's give it a shot."
2,33,Buford,"(happily) Teddy Boo Boo! (angrily) Where have you been, you bad bear?! I bet you've been on the road again, haven't you?! Well, you're grounded, mister! (happily) Oh, I love you!"
2,33,Candace,"You know, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro, every time I try to show my mom something, it disappears and she thinks I'm crazy. What do you think I should do?"
2,33,Vivian,Eat! You're too thin! Have a matzah ball-rito!
2,33,Candace,Er...thanks.
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Who's tap tap tapping? Is that that pesky raven again? (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz backwards, to which he responds with sarcasm) Oh, big surprise! Perry the Platypus! And by ""surprise"", I mean completely...Uhhh...uhhh, I got nothin'. (He activates a remote, we hear something drop and Perry looks around) I was really expecting the raven. I'll be honest. And by the way, you're trapped in an invisible box! Yes, I know, I trapped you before in an invisible cage, but this is different! It's a box! It's all part of my evil plan to rid the world of annoying mimes! You see, recently, I was..."
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) ...strolling through the park, when suddenly, I had the strangest feeling that people were looking at me. And laughing! Probably because people were actually looking at me and laughing! I couldn't figure out what was going on until I turned around and saw a mime! He was mocking me: my walk, my incessant hand-wringing, my mantis-like posture! (The mime gets a giant mantis from the left side of the screen and chomps it) Then that I decided to get even."
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Behold, the mime-inator! With this baby, I'm going to trap every mime in the Tri-State Area in their very own invisible box! I know, huh? Fun with irony!"
2,33,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. We're ready! How 'bout you? (Ferb nods)"
2,33,Phineas,I'm tasting the clouds!
2,33,Isabella,I'm feelin' the ozone!
2,33,Buford,I am dryin' my pits!
2,33,Photographer,"Say, ""¡Queso!"""
2,33,Candace,"Wait a minute. (smiles) The photo transporter! All I have to do is put my mom's photo in the machine, then she'll be transported right to the boys! Right?"
2,33,Photographer,(looks to both sides awkwardly) Jess?
2,33,Candace,(gasps) Then the boys' invention can't disappear before Mom sees it because she'll be in it! It's fool-proof! Phineas and Ferb will be busted once and for all! (grabs the camera) Can I borrow this? (zips away)
2,33,Photographer,Hey! My mom gave me that!
2,33,Candace,"Smile! (she snaps the photo, which comes out instantly, she looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!! (looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!! (looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!! (looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!! (looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!! (looks at the photo) Aha! (shows it to Linda) AHA!!"
2,33,Linda,"(overlapping) Aw, it's nice to see you giving up your obsession with the boys and getting into the spirt of things."
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, you really are quite the mime! It really looks like you are inside an invisible b—(gasps) Oh, that's right! You really are inside an invisible box! Ha ha ha! I'm already tired of that joke, but I can't stop saying it. (activating the inator) You know, it works so well with the mimes that I decided to put everyone in the Tri-State Area in an invisible box! Ha ha ha! (The inator stops moving. Doofenshmirtz clicks the remote several times.) Oh, for crying out loud! (He walks over to a handle bar and starts moving the inator manually.)"
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, to pull the switch. (Perry jumps on him) Thanks for the headache! (Perry punches him in the eye) Thanks for the face-ache!"
2,33,Phineas,Has everyone had a chance to try the machine?
2,33,Buford,"Yeah, I got my teddy bear."
2,33,Isabella,I got my missing Mindy doll.
2,33,Baljeet,And I found my missing Uncle Maulik!
2,33,Uncle Maulik,"Baljeet, I was just on vacation."
2,33,Baljeet,Oh. Were you having a good time?
2,33,Uncle Maulik,I was.
2,33,Phineas,Perry's not back yet. I know! I'll put a photo of him in the machine and transport him back here. (Phineas scans the photo of Perry.)
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"No, Perry the Platypus, don't press the self-destruct button!"
2,33,Candace,(offscreen) You're all so busted!
2,33,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry!"
2,33,Candace,(panting) Ah-ha-ha! Move it! This is it! The ultimate bust!
2,33,Man,"Okay. (He lifts the piñata up) Oopsies! Ha! Come on! You gotta put more effort into it! (The ray zaps Linda) ¡Oy, carumba!"
2,33,Linda,More effort? You got it!
2,33,Candace,Yes! It worked! (chasing her mother) Mom! Mom! Look!
2,33,Linda,(overlapping) Where is the piñata?
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,W-Where did he go? He was standing right there about to foil my evil plans and now I'm...and now I'm totally free to move forward with my heinous project! Woo-hoo!
2,33,Candace,MOMMM!!!!
2,33,Baljeet,There is no candy in me!!!! There is no candy in me!!!
2,33,Buford,(overlapping) Look out!!!
2,33,Linda,(offscreen) Could somebody please tell me if I am warm or cold?
2,33,Candace,(offscreen) You're cold!!!
2,33,Baljeet,(offscreen) THERE IS NO CANDY IN ME!!!
2,33,Buford,(offscreen) Why is this happening?!?!
2,33,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, invisible boxes for everyone! (The ray zaps the inator. Doofenshmirtz looks at the empty space confused) Sure! WWWWWWhy not?"
2,33,Candace,"Mom, look! MOM, LOOK!!! (She jumps on her mother causing the bat to fall out of her grip and flying in the area of the transporter) MOM!!! LOOK!!!"
2,33,Linda,"(lifting her blindfold) Oh my goodness! I walked all the way home? (Candace's eyes open) I guess it's hard to judge distances blindfolded. (stands up) Well, snacks anyone? (walks away)"
2,33,Candace,Bu-bu-bu-bu-but...bu-bu-bu-bu-but...bu-bu-bu-bu-but... (repeat ad infinitum)
2,33,(Song,There is No Candy in Me)
2,33,Phineas,(imitating a turntable) Wacka-wacka-wack...
2,33,Baljeet,"(rapping) ♪ There is no candy in me, ♪"
2,33,Buford,Nerd ain't no piñata!
2,1,Phineas,We're here!
2,1,Lawrence,"Ah, Lake Nose."
2,1,Linda,"This is just what i needed. A nice, relaxing family getaway."
2,1,Lawrence,"Such beauty, such tranquility. A fisherman's paradise. Yes, of all the lakes in the world, I'm glad we picked the Nose."
2,1,Linda,"That's charming, dear."
2,1,Candace,(Looks out the car window) I still can't believe I get to be on the Lake Nose lifeguard squad with Jeremy. The lifeguards at Lake Nose are considered the coolest of the cool. All the other kids look up to them and have to do whatever they say.
2,1,Phineas,(With a Lake Nose guide) Or they'll get eaten.
2,1,Candace,"Exactly. I-- Wait, what?"
2,1,Phineas,"It says here ""Many believe these murky waters are home to Nosey, the ferocious Lake Nose Monster""."
2,1,Candace,"(Laughs) Nosey? Yeah, I'm so sure. There is no such thing as a Lake Nose Monster. Right, Dad?"
2,1,Lawrence,"Well, Candace there's no such thing as lots of things, and there's such thing as many other things. (Spins the steering wheel) Is Nosey such a thing? (The car stops turning) Well, you see, that's the thing, isn't it?"
2,1,Candace,"Dad, is this one of those cultural things again? Because I'm not sure they'd even know what the heck you're talking about in England."
2,1,Phineas,"Ooh! It's possible Nosey has survived (Camera zooms in on him) because Lake Nose is unusually rich in zinc, a common metal used in everything from sunblock to pennies. Cool."
2,1,Candace,"Oh, of course! Nosey the vicious zinc-eating dinosaur. Now it makes perfect sense! Thank you, crazy people I live with!"
2,1,Phineas,"It doesn't say ""Eats it"". He probably just absorbs it through his skin. (Camera pans to him) Ooh, look! (Flips the guide) They have pictures of him."
2,1,Candace,"(Reading the guide) Elephant, log, dolphin, driftwood, tire, driftwood, rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig, driftwood, driftwood, you aren't old enough to know what that is, driftwood, driftwood, it's usually driftwood. (Camera zooms out) So don't go humiliating me by, I don't know, building some boat (Picks up luggage cases) to find the Lake Nose Monster or something."
2,1,Phineas,"Huh. Some boat to find the Lake Nose Monster (Camera zooms in on Phineas and Ferb) or something. (At Ferb) Ferb, are you not saying what I'm thinking? (Pause. The camera zooms out) Hey, where's Perry?"

2,1,Carl,"Exit to your left, Agent P."
2,1,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. I hope you enjoyed Lair Entrance: The Ride. The agency wanted to make coming into work more exciting. It was either that or a huge bonus check."
2,1,Major Monogram,"Well, in focus group tests, 6-year-olds overwhelming preferred singing animals to a piece of paper with numbers on it, so I-- (Clears throat) Anyway, your mission: We've tracked Dr. Doofenshmirtz here to Lake Nose where we intercepted part of this phone call."
2,1,Operator,"I'm sorry, sir. We do not deliver our hot wings to the bottom of a lake."
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,Aw come on! I'll tip 15%!
2,1,Major Monogram,"Our analysts agree: Evil, chicken wings, underwater, 15%. It's a recipe for disaster. It's up to you to stop him, Agent P."
2,1,Phineas,(At the dock with a boat) I think we're all set to get definitive proof that Nosey really exists.
2,1,Candace,"(Walks onto the dock wearing lifeguard uniform) All right, what are you two up to?"
2,1,Phineas,We've just built a boat to find the Lake Nose Monster.
2,1,Candace,"What? Didn't I specifically tell you not to do specifically, exactly just that?"
2,1,Phineas,"Actually, specifically, you said not to humiliate you by doing that. So we won't!"
2,1,Candace,"Mom! Quick, I caught them red-handed!"
2,1,Linda,(Walks onto the dock) What is going on out here?
2,1,Candace,"All right, so where is it?"
2,1,Phineas,Where is what?
2,1,Candace,The giant Lake Nose Monster search boat you made!
2,1,Phineas,You mean Nosebud? She's right there.
2,1,Linda,You boys made this? I'm very impressed!
2,1,Candace,What?
2,1,Linda,"Well, look! They made a boat. It's actually waterproof and everything. That's pretty cool!"
2,1,Linda,"Okay, Candace. If you're so worried... (Calls out) Honey!"
2,1,Lawrence,"(Dashes to the dock) Yes, dear?"
2,1,Linda,Can you please go out on the lake with the boys to make sure they don't get into any trouble?
2,1,Lawrence,"(Chuckles) Well... (Dashes off and comes back wearing fishing gear) If I must. (Camera zooms into him) Well, who knows? I might even be persuaded to tell a few of my world-famous fishing stories."
2,1,Candace,"Well, I guess that's kind of a punishment. But come on, Mom, that's all you're gonna do?"
2,1,Linda,"Right, what was I thinking? (Holds up a bottle of sunblock) Here! Don't forget to use plenty of sunblock."
2,1,Candace,But--
2,1,Phineas,Look! Zinc.
2,1,Linda,"Sweetie, aren't you gonna be late for your first lifeguard shift?"
2,1,Candace,"All right, give me some zinc."
2,1,Candace,"(While carrying a surfboard) Okay, be cool and confident. Cool and confident. Hey, Jeremy! (Jazzy music plays) So, what do you think?"
2,1,Jeremy,You look great!
2,1,Captain,"So, you're the famous Candace Flynn? (Pulls out his hand) Bob Webber."
2,1,Candace,"(Shakes hands) Thanks for the lifeguard job, Mr. Webber."
2,1,Bob,"""Mr. Webber""? Pshaw! Mr. Webber's my father. Call me ""Captain Webber""."
2,1,Candace,"Uh, okay."
2,1,Bob,(Snaps his fingers) Okay! You two take care of my beach now.
2,1,Candace,Okay.
2,1,Bob,(Snaps his fingers) Okay! And watch out for Nosey! (Laughs)
2,1,Candace and Jeremy,"(Feign chuckle) Uh, okay."
2,1,Bob,(Snaps his fingers) (Echoing) Okay!
2,1,Lawrence,"...So he said, ""Try ignoring it and hope it goes away. (Camera zooms into them) And you know what? It did. After 17 weeks."
2,1,Phineas,"Wow, Dad, great story. (Ferb raises his hand and Phineas puts it down) Uh, we're gonna start our search for Nosey now, okay?"
2,1,Bob,(Snaps his fingers) (Echoing) Okay!
2,1,Lawrence,"Oh, did I ever tell you boys about the time I caught the infamous Big Mouth Ramon?"
2,1,Phineas,Yes!
2,1,Lawrence,"Splendid! Then I'll set the scene: (Phineas and Ferb stand onto a circle spot which is an elevator. The elevator goes down) A chilly April morning, 1980. (As he speaks the elevator descends) Disco was on the way out and it had just begun to dawn on everybody they looked absolutely ridiculous in every photo taken of them in... (The elevator stops and dings, and it's door opens)"
2,1,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb..."
2,1,Bob,(Snaps his fingers) (Echoing) Okay!
2,1,Phineas,(He and Ferb run out of the elevator) Let's find us a lake monster.
2,1,Phineas,She's in the drink. Do we have eyes?
2,1,Phineas,"If anything's gonna get proof of Nosey, it's Marco Schnozolo."
2,1,Jeremy,"Don't worry, Candace. To be honest, not much happens around here."
2,1,Candace,"Aw, too bad. I guess we'll just be forced to kick back and have fun."
2,1,Jeremy,Yeah! We could take turns saving each other.
2,1,Candace,"Ah, yeah."
2,1,(Song,Save You Save Me)
2,1,Jeremy,Candace? (Snaps his fingers) Candace!
2,1,Candace,"Huh? (Blushes) Oh, sorry."
2,1,Jeremy,"As I was saying, being a lifeguard takes focus and concentration."
2,1,Candace,"Focus, right."
2,1,Jeremy,"If you just keep a calm, cool head, you'll be fine."
2,1,Candace,"(Gasps) THE LAKE NOSE MONSTER!!!! EVERYBODY, (Rings the bell) OUT OF THE WATER!!! (Screams)"
2,1,Candace,(On a megaphone) GET OUT! RUN! (Screams)
2,1,Bob,Huh? Wha--? What?
2,1,Bob,"Everyone, please, calm down! (The crowd stampedes on him)"
2,1,Candace,"(Pulling a woman's arm) Go, ma'am, leave your child! There's no time! (Whistle blows) Save yourself!"
2,1,Jeremy,"(Blows whistle) Hey, Candace!"
2,1,Jeremy,"Everybody calm down! We're safe, look! (Picks the ""Lake Nose Monster"" up) It-- It's just some driftwood."
2,1,Candace,"Driftwood? (Chuckles nervously) Sorry, everyone. It's safe. You can come back, okay?"
2,1,Bob,(Comes out of his stampede hole and snaps his fingers) That was not okay.
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,Hmm?
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? (Chuckles) Thank goodness, I-- I thought you were the guy with my hot wings. In two more minutes, my order will be free! Yes!"
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh for crying out loud! (Takes the hot wings) Fine. Okay, what was that? 15 bucks? All right, here's 10, 11, I got more here. Hold on. 1, 2, 3, 4, there! $15! And don't forget your tip! (Presses a button on the steering wheel, activating a diving helmet trap. He chuckles) Pretty good, huh? (Camera zooms out) So, Perry the Platypus... (Bites off a hot wing) I bet you're wondering why I'm sitting down here at the bottom of a lake. Well, the answer is simple. Mmm-mmm! This is really good, man. You want some? (Takes a box with the red wings) Here, here. (Perry takes a hot wing) Take the blue cheese. (Perry takes the blue cheese and pours it on the red wing) Do you know, I-- I prefer the ranch. Take the blue cheese. (Perry bite the red wing, and Doof holds up a napkin) Here's a napkin. (Perry takes the napkin) Anyway, the answer why I'm here is simple. Zinc. Lake Nose has a ton of zinc, and this machine goes around and filters all the zinc from the water. (Camera zooms out, showing a zinc tank) See, see? Zinc! So I figured I'd go around collecting all the zinc, and then use that zinc in some evil way to rule the world! You know, with zinc. Just think of the evil uses that off with zinc! (Pause. He looks around) I mean, seriously, can you think of some? Cause I got nothing. (Walks to a chart) I mean, look at here with all the good uses for zinc. Huh? All this good stuff, and over here? Nothing. All I got is ""Some evil ""Zinc Ray-Inator"" or something, and, and look here! I wrote ""Big laundry"". I-- I don't even remember what the reason was, so I assumed I remembered some big genius Idea. Big laundry. (Deep voice) Big laundry. (Normal voice) I, it-- It's crazy! I'm a crazy person."
2,1,Bob,"(snap) Okay! Candace, since it's your first day and you are understandably eager to impress old Captain Webber, I'll give you another chance."
2,1,Candace,"Thank you, Captain Webber. Don't worry, from now on, I'll be okay."
2,1,Bob,(snap) Okay!
2,1,Candace,"Well, at least the beach is empty now. (to jeremy) It makes our lives a lot easier."
2,1,Woman 1,"(offscreen) Hey, is this where they saw Nosey?"
2,1,Man 1,Come on!
2,1,Man 2,You bring the camcorder?
2,1,Candace,So...many...people!
2,1,Jeremy,"Don't worry, Candace. Just stick with me and I'll get you through this, okay?"
2,1,Bob,"(snap) Okay! Jeremy, we're gonna have to move you down to Station 7 to cover this crowd, okay?"
2,1,Jeremy,"Uh, okay."
2,1,Bob,"(snap) Okay! (leaves) Candace, you stay here."
2,1,Candace,WHAT?! Wait...by myself?! But—
2,1,Man 1,Let's be unsafe!
2,1,Man 2,I'm gonna run with scissors!
2,1,Woman,I brought some glass to the beach!
2,1,Phineas,"(offscreen) Here, Nosey, Nosey, Nosey. Hey, look, Ferb, it's a red herring! I say we follow it and see where it leads us."
2,1,Phineas,"What was that? (The giant line begins moving and comes apart.) Check the perimeter cameras! (Ferb walks up to the perimeter cameras, but one by one, they all also go offline.) Without the cameras down here, we're— (The lights go off) blind."
2,1,Computer,Emergency power on.
2,1,Phineas,So much for getting proof. What was that? Did we find the Lake Nose Monster?
2,1,Ferb,No. (The chomped off camera sinks down.) It found us. (The lights go out.)
2,1,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, fire it up! (Ferb flicks a switch and we hear the turbine engines rolling.) Cool! That's weird. All the cameras are still down. It's gonna be much harder to get proof that Nosey exists now. You man the starboard window, I'll go portside. (A sea creature appears behind him.) We'll see who spots Nosey first. (Phineas looks at the menacing creature behind him.) I win! (to Nosey) Stay calm. (Nosey growls and Ferb backs away) No sudden movements. Okay, try panicking and making a lot of sudden movements. (Nosey grabs the camera that Ferb is holding and sinks down and smashes it to pieces with his tail.) I don't think Nosey was attacking us at all. He was just going after the cameras. He must not want the world to know he really exists."
2,1,Lawrence,It was either back up the fire escape or lose the pants altogether. Then suddenly it hit me.
2,1,Candace,"Ow! Hey, watch it, brats! (Cut to her approaching a couple of kids burying their friend in the sand.) No! You're supposed to bury everything except the head! Hey, no! We do not drink the lake water! (Cut to two kids holding cups. Wide shot to reveal an older man sipping the water through a drinking straw.) That goes for your children, too, sir!"
2,1,Little Girl,"Excuse me. My daddy came to see Nosey, but I'm scared. Is he really coming back?"
2,1,Candace,"Aw, I don't know, sweetie. I was being silly before and overreacted. Sometimes we see things that aren't really there, but don't worry. I promise I'll protect you if...I...see... (Wide shot of the lake. Nosey's head appears out of the water.) THE LAKE NOSE MONSTER!!! (Everyone jumps out of the water screaming.) Quick, kid, run as fast as your little legs can carry you! Follow the train tracks north! You should hit Ackerton by sundown! Blend in! It's a college town! Get a retail job and save up enough for a bus ticket to the Canadian border! Someone will get in touch with you when the coast is clear!"
2,1,Bob,Candace! Is this your Lake Nose Monster?
2,1,Candace,Huh?
2,1,Baljeet,(nervously) Surprise?
2,1,Bob,"You're in big trouble, young man! (snap) Okay! Just a little prankster! We're safe!"
2,1,Baljeet,I thought you said this would be funny.
2,1,Buford,It is! You got in trouble! (He laughs loud and long.)
2,1,Bob,"Candace, what on earth are you doing?"
2,1,Candace,"I'm sorry, Captain Webber, I thought I saw—"
2,1,Bob,"I know. Look, I'll let you in on a secret. There is no Lake Nose Monster. It's just a little tall tale, like Bigfoot or that face on Mars. See, they pretend that Nosey is real so tourists from all over the world come here and buy Nosey T-shirts and snowglobes. But.. (Throws the snowglobe away)"
2,1,Man,(offscreen) Ow!
2,1,Bob,...it's just pretend.
2,1,Candace,Okay.
2,1,Bob,"(snap) Okay! So that's it. No matter what you see, I never again want to hear you say—"
2,1,Candace,(gasps) THE LAKE NOSE MONSTER!!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!! HURRY!!!
2,1,Phineas,"(to Ferb) Hey, do you still have that little digital camera you got for Bastille Day? (Ferb takes it out and gives it to his stepbrother. Phineas snaps a photo. This angers Nosey more. He goes up to the window.) Bup-bup-bup, check this out. (He throws the camera on the ground and it shatters to pieces. He stomps on the remains.) See, boy? Your secret's safe with us. (Nosey smiles and disappears.) Hey! Where'd he go? (Nosey appears in the submarine) Is it me, or is the Lake Nose Monster easier to find than Perry?"
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Mmmm... Ooh, wow! (chuckles) Time out, man, I need a breather. (He falls to the floor on his back) Oh! I wish I didn't eat the hot and spicy right after the honey glazed. Speaking of wishes, you know what I never understood? Genies. They tell you to wish for anything you want and then they add some terrible twist. Like you-you wish to jump high, so he turns you into a frog. What—? Why? Who gains from this? The genie? I— Where's the benefit? (Perry gets out a device to make his escape.) You should be fighting genies, man, not me. I'm not the problem. Genies. Genies are the problem. (gasp) I got it! (Perry stops cutting through the bars and Doof sits up) Zinc foil! (Pause as Doof lies back down) Eh, not really evil, is it?"
2,1,Phineas,"Here. You want some corn dogs, boy? (Nosey sniffs the dogs and smiles. He takes a big bite out of them. He smiles and claps his fins happily.) He likes it!"
2,1,(Song,My Wettest Friend)
2,1,Phineas,Hey! Someone's calling! (Cut to a videophone. Phineas answers it. Baljeet appears on screen.) Y'ello?
2,1,Baljeet,"Phineas, is your refrigerator running?"
2,1,Phineas,"Uh, we don't have a refrigerator, Baljeet."
2,1,Baljeet,Then you better go catch it? (The gang all stare. Baljeet speaks to someone offscreen.) I thought you said that would be funny.
2,1,Buford,(appearing onscreen) It was! You look stupid! (laughs) It works on so many levels. (feed gets cut off)
2,1,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Nosey. This is just our videophone. See, when we talk to people, we can see them on this screen. (Shows an image of himself and Nosey on the screen.) And this is what they see. (Nosey gasps.) What's wrong? (Nosey gets welled up with tears and snarls and leaves.) Oh, wait, no! We weren't taking your picture! Come back."
2,1,Candace,I can't believe he fired me. And this time I actually saw it!
2,1,Jeremy,"(approaching her) Candace, are you okay?"
2,1,Candace,"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, Jeremy, but I saw it, I really did! I mean, not the times when I saw it and it wasn't it, but this last time, when I saw it and it was it! You believe me, don't you?"
2,1,Jeremy,Well...mm...
2,1,Candace,"(sighs) It's okay. Earlier this morning, I wouldn't have believed me either. In fact, I was even mocking my... (gets an idea) brothers! That's it! They'll vindicate me! They're out there right now getting proof that Nosey is real!"
2,1,Phineas,"I can't believe it! We were probably the first people Nosey ever trusted and look what happened. Come on, Ferb! Let's suit up!"
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it looks like we got all of the zinc from this area. It's time to move on to the next quadrant! ""Quadrant."" ""Quad-rant."" Quad—It's—It's a weird word when you think about it. ""Quadrant."" ""Quad-rant."" (Perry resumes filing the bars.) Quad—It's—See? Now it doesn't even sound like a word."
2,1,Phineas,"Hey, look! It's Nosey! (Cut to Nosey looking sad.) He doesn't look too good. (They swim up to him.)  What's the matter, boy? (Nosey groans. Phineas looks at his watch.) Oh, no. The zinc levels in the lake seem to be dropping. Nosey needs zinc in order to survive. (Ferb takes out the sunblock their mother gave them earlier.) Sunblock? With zinc! Good thinkin', Ferb! Here, Nosey, this'll make you feel better. (Phineas pours some sunblock onto Nosey's head. Nosey revives but then looks scared at something and swims away.) Where do you suppose he's going? (The ground shakes) What's that? (Doofenshmirtz's device comes up to them and sucks practically everything in its path. Phineas and Ferb hold onto a branch. Nosey returns and hits it.)"
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, wait, w-what was that? (Perry jumps out of the scuba mask and the bars drop off.) Huh? You were trying to escape?! After I shared my wings with you! Well, granted,  I did trap you like a monkey— (Perry punches him.)"
2,1,Phineas,"Thanks, Nosey! (Phineas and Ferb take off their helmets.) We understand now. If we prove to the world that you really exist, they'd never just let you live here in peace, huh? (Nosey shakes his head and dives down.) It's too bad you don't exist, Nosey, cuz if you did, I think we'd become great friends. (Winks. Nosey winks back.)"
2,1,Lawrence,"I said, ""John, it's great, I love the tune but the words. 'All you need is a Phillips head screwdriver', it just doesn't really ring true, does it?"" (Phineas and Ferb reappear on the boat.)"
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"I've got you now, Perry the Platyp— (He trips on a wing. The lair rams into the submarine and the boat begins speeding.)"
2,1,Lawrence,Oho!  There was simply no way we could get through the entire petting zoo—
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Heh, any day now. Hey, where are you going?! (Perry goes into the bathroom and slams the door.) Oh—Oh, I see. (The toilet is heard flushing) That's—That's the hot wings working there. Ha ha ha. (A knocking is heard. Pan left to reveal Perry outside the lair.) Hey, how did you—?! Oh, you got out through the—I—I see."
2,1,Lawrence,"So, anyway, there I was, four hours from the nearest dental supply store..."
2,1,Lawrence and Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry!"
2,1,Bob,"Mmm...delicious. Best hot wings in town. (snap) Okay! I think I'll go for a little swim. That whole ""waiting 20 minutes after you eat"" thing is all a big hoax. (Takes out a snowglobe.) It's just so we can sell these cool ""Kid with a cramp"" snowglobes. (Bob wades in the lake and looks through his binoculars.) Hmm. That boat's moving pretty fast. I'd better get out of the w—Oh! Cramp!"
2,1,Bob,Can't move! (Cut to a shot of the snowglobe followed by a closeup of Bob's lips like in Citizen Kane.) Nosebud. (He drops the snow globe. Candace jumps on Bob and gets him out of the way.)
2,1,Lawrence,...and that is how I caught Big Mouth Ramone.
2,1,Phineas,"Cool story, Dad."
2,1,Candace,"How you feeling, Captain Webber?"
2,1,Bob,"(snap) Okay! Thanks to you, Candace. How would you like to be reinstated as a Lake Nose lifeguard?"
2,1,Candace,Well... (snap) Okay!
2,1,Bob,Don't get it.
2,1,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Candace!"
2,1,Candace,Did you get it? Did you get the proof that Nosey really exists?
2,1,Phineas,"I can honestly tell you that a ferocious, man-eating lake monster does not exist in Lake Nose."
2,1,Guy,"Aw, man!"
2,1,Candace,"Wait. So does a non-ferocious, friendly lake monster exist? Do you have proof of that? Hmm?"
2,1,Phineas,"Do we have proof? No. (winks, points and smiles)"
2,1,Ferb,"Well, if such a creature did exist, I believe its habitat and safety would be all of our responsibility to look after and protect."
2,1,Man,"Hey, wait a minute. Everyone, that British kid is saying something really, really...boring."
2,1,Kid,"Yeah, let's get out of here!"
2,1,Phineas,"I didn't think it was boring, Ferb."
2,1,Candace,"You know what I think? I think you two found Nosey, but you didn't bring back any proof, specifically just to make me look foolish, in front of all of these— (Sees a chomped camera in the lake) Wait a minute. (Picks it up) Look at this! Only one thing could've made a bite mark this big! Yes! I have proof! Now they'll have to...believe...me... (Sees the sad expressions on her brothers' faces.) Or maybe you were specifically trying to protect Nosey. (Phineas smiles.) Oh. I'm gonna have to do the right thing here, aren't I?"
2,1,Phineas,"We're proud of you, sis. (Ferb gives a thumbs up.)"
2,1,Candace,"(throwing the camera in the garbage) Yeah, yeah. Candace is crazy, but the monster is safe. (Nosey appears out of the water and smiles at Candace.) Oh, great. Look who finally showed up! (Nosey kisses her.)  Fine."
2,1,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, looks like I'm stuck down here. Guess I'll have time to figure out what ""big laundry"" mea—Oh. (sees a huge pile of dirty clothes) Oh, that's right. It's Tuesday. (gasps) I know! (runs to the bathroom) I can get out the same way Perry the Platypus did! (Toilet is heard flushing and water comes out from under the door.) Oh! Oh! Oh, that didn't work at all! Oh, now I really gotta do the laundry!"
2,32,Man,Oh cool! Old records! Lindana. Now that's a blast from the past. Wonder where she is now... Probably singing at retirement homes.
2,32,Linda,"Oh, give me that. (takes the box of records)"
2,32,Man,"Hey, you look familiar."
2,32,Phineas,"Hey Dad, what are these?"
2,32,Lawrence,"Oh wow, those are my old black and white detective movies."
2,32,Phineas,Do you mind if we watch them?
2,32,Lawrence,"Not at all boys, the projector's inside."
2,32,Phineas,"Great, come on Ferb."
2,32,Lawrence,"Oh I see you like that little doll. Well lets see... that'll cost you, uh, fifty cents?"
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,I'll give you a dollar.
2,32,Detective/Narrator,"She rolled into my office like a fog bank. Mysterious. Cold. My instincts told me this dame was nothing but trouble. But trouble's my middle name... Well not really. My middle name is ""Trumble""...Sounds a lot like trouble."
2,32,Phineas,"Wow, this detective stuff is great."
2,32,Detective/Narrator,She had something she needed to say. And she spoke with the voice of an angel...
2,32,Candace,Phineas! Where's the box that was in my room?!
2,32,Phineas,Well dad was taking boxes out to the yard sale...
2,32,Candace,"Dad, Dad, wait! (She arrives at the front yard) Dad, is that the box from my room?"
2,32,Lawrence,Well yes...
2,32,Candace,I think I put my little Mary McGuffin doll in there by mistake. Have you seen her?
2,32,Lawrence,"I just sold her for a whole dollar. Here, you can have it."
2,32,Lawrence,How about two dollars?
2,32,Vanessa,Dad? What are you doing here? This isn't your weekend.
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, yes I know, but I have a surprise for you and I just couldn't wait!"
2,32,Vanessa,(excited) A surprise? Really?
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, it's something you've always wanted. Something you've asked for time and time again. In my hand, I hold the key to..."
2,32,Vanessa,... My new car!
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,"(holds up Mary McGuffin doll) No, your happiness! Remember when you said if I got you a little Mary McGufffin doll, I'd be the world's greatest dad?"
2,32,Vanessa,"Yeah, when I was like, seven."
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,At long last I have found one! I have been scouring the Internet and... and Garage sales trying to find the discontinued doll.
2,32,Vanessa,"Wow, I can't believe you remembered I wanted this."
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,Remembered?! I never stop looking!
2,32,Vanessa,Really?
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, I may be an evil scientist, but it doesn't take a degree purchased from the Internet with your ex-wife's money, to know how special and important you are to me."
2,32,Vanessa,That's so sweet.
2,32,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I'd better run. I bought a used -inator today at the garage sale, and it's missing one small part."
2,32,Vanessa,Really? what does it do?

2,32,Phineas,"We decided to investigate at the scene of the crime. We talked to a Lawrence Fletcher, a tall gaunt looking average Joe who... (Ferb stops playing the sax, and Phineas switches back to his normal voice) Sorry."
2,32,Lawrence,Is that my old black and white saxophone?
2,32,Phineas,We thought the investigation could use a little ambiance.
2,32,Lawrence,"Oh, delightful. How can I help?"
2,32,Phineas,We need you to tell us everything you can about the man who bought the doll.
2,32,Lawrence,"Well, let me see... He had some kind of a German accent, and ooh, he was wearing a lab coat."
2,32,Phineas,"A lab coat, huh? Ferb? (Ferb begins to play the saxophone again) For an average Joe, he gave us an above average clue. Our next step was clear."

Phone lines are clogged and web sites are crashing as local music fans try to get first crack at the hottest concert tickets of the decade!"
2,30,Candace,Must...get...tickets...
2,30,Candace,"Zzzzzzzzzzzz... (She takes her head out of the keyboard to reveal many keys in her face. They pop out to the music of ""Shave and a haircut, two bits"". She spits two keys out of her mouth.) Oh, still not on sale! (A crash is heard) What the?!"
2,30,Candace,"Hey, isn't it a bit early to start building another crazy contraption?"
2,30,Phineas,"What, this? We're still cleaning up from yesterday. It's funny, the cleanup usually takes care of itself, but we've been working all night on this one. (A recycling truck comes to take the dumpster.) That's the last of it, guys! Thanks! (to Candace) It was our biggest project ever! How could you miss it?"
2,30,Candace,"I was kind of busy. (Her phone rings. She zips inside and picks up.) Stacy, what's up?"
2,30,Stacy,(on phone) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! My ticket is in row R!!!! Close enough to smell them!!!!! What did you get?!!?
2,30,Candace,Ticket? How'd you get a ticket?
2,30,Stanky Dog,"That's right, folks! Unless you've had your head stickin' out of a window, you know those tickets just went on sale and sold out in 13 seconds flat!"
2,30,Candace,Sold out?
2,30,Stanky Dog,That's right! Sold out! But you still might be able to catch this special added benefit concert tonight at the Fireside Girls Jamboree!
2,30,Candace,"Okay, I still got a chance! What the heck? ""FIRESIDE GIRLS ONLY! PLEASE ENTER YOUR PATCH #""? (types frantically) Gotta guess the right numbers. Gotta guess the right numbers. ""YOU HAVE EXCEEDED YOUR LOG-IN ATTEMPTS""? No, you've exceeded your log-in attempts!! PHINEAS!!!!!"

2,30,Candace,"Your little friend, Isabella, she's a Fireside Girl, right?! What's her patch number?!"

2,30,Candace,"Tell you what, I'm joining up! (slams her hand on the podium) Set me up, sister!"
2,30,Isabella,Okay. I hereby nominate Candace Flynn into membership in the Loyal Sisterhood of Fireside Girls.
2,30,Katie and Ginger,I second! Jinx! (they giggle)
2,30,Isabella,"Alright, girls, come to order. (to Candace) Now, just fill out this application, read the training manual, sign the insurance waivers, and you can be sworn in at our meeting next week."
2,30,Candace,Next week?! But that's too late!
2,30,Isabella,"I'm sorry, but the traditional procedure comes straight from the Fireside Rules of Order (shows her what looks like a portrait of an old lady in a rocking chair) as established by our founder, Eliza M. Feyersied."
2,30,Candace,"Well, that's a stupid rule."
2,30,Eliza M. Feyersied,"(from the ""portrait"") You watch your mouth, little lady!"
2,30,Candace,Who puts a picture frame on a window?
2,30,Phineas,Is there anything Ferb and I can do to help? Candace really wants to see that concert.

2,30,Isabella,"Candace, you're not listening to me. You don't—"
2,30,Candace,Pfft! Forget it! I thought Fireside Girls were supposed to help people.
2,30,Eliza M. Feyersied,There is another way!
2,30,Isabella,You don't mean—
2,30,Eliza M. Feyersied,"Yes! Isabella, please read Article 9, Section Charlie, Footnote 6."
2,30,Isabella,"""A troop leader may award full Fireside Girl status to any girl who has earned 50 patches."" But, Mrs. Feyersied, 50 patches in one day?! Is that even possible?!"
2,30,Eliza M. Feyersied,"Well, it depends on how badly she wants it."
2,30,Candace,Bring it on!
2,30,Isabella,Alright! All you need is a cadet uniform and we can get started.
2,30,Candace,Okay. Where can I buy one?
2,30,Candace,Ouch! (she puts her finger in her mouth)

2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"(scratching his head) I don't know what just happened, but I like it. Now, with you safely inside the cage, (pushes a button on a remote) I can unveil my new device of doom. (the inator rises from the floor) Behold, the Metal-Destructinator!"
2,30,Candace,Fifty patches in one day?! (cut to inside to reveal Candace now in her uniform) Where do I start?
2,30,Phineas,"By combining the shortest linear distance with the highest population density, we've plotted a course for you that's optimized for the greatest number of patch-acquiring opportunities in the shortest period of time."
2,30,Phineas,"Then after you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch. Got it?"
2,30,Candace,Is all that really necessary?
2,30,Phineas,"We're going to need you to plant one of these Fireside Girl markers at the site of each task so the girls at the lodge can track your progress. Now, is Candace Gertrude Flynn your full legal name?"
2,30,Candace,Ugh. Yes.
2,30,Isabella,Great! You just earned your Honesty Patch! Congratulations!
2,30,Candace,"Really? That was easy! C'mon, let me do another!"
2,30,Isabella,"Ooh, I think you just earned your Enthusiasm Patch!"
2,30,Candace,Wow! Two down! (does a happy dance)
2,30,Phineas,48 to go!
2,30,Candace,Yippee! This is easy!
2,30,Phineas,Okay. (quiz show music plays in the background) 15 senior citizens need help crossing a street that's 50 feet across.
2,30,Candace,"Ooh, goody, I'm great at word problems."
2,30,Phineas,"No, there's 15 senior citizens that need help crossing the street. (Cut to reveal Candace on roller skates on a conveyor belt.) Good luck, Candace. Don't forget your helmet. (He pulls the lever and gives her a helmet as she rolls down screaming.)"

2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"So let me explain my new evil scheme. A while back, my doctor put me on a low-carb diet, but I still can't lose those last ten pounds. (Lifts his shirt up revealing his rather large gut. Puts his shirt back down.) Every time I get close to my goal, there's this knocking at the door."
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,Who is it?
2,30,Milly,Fireside Girls. Would you like to buy some of our cupcakes?
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,Cupcakes you say? I-I really shouldn't. I should get back to my exercise. I'm almost down to my goal.
2,30,Milly,"Oh, we understand. Have a nice—"
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"(swiping the log out of her hands and giving her money) Alright, you talked me into it!"
2,30,Milly,Thanks!
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"So with my weakness for high-carb sweets, there's really no other choice but to get rid of the bridge to the Fireside cupcake factory. And my Metal-Destructinator can turn any metal object into broccoli. I know what you're thinking, why broccoli? But, w-well, y'know, it's healthy. It's like the opposite of what I'm trying to get— It's—It's poetic justice. It's—Well, it's not—not justice, exactly... Poetic evil. It's poetically evil. Now, to make some last-minute adjustments... (hums)"
2,30,Isabella,Wrestling an Alligator in a Sewer Patch...

2,30,Candace,"Here are your cupcakes! AAAAAAAAH! (some bugs crash into her face, she spits some out)"
2,30,Phineas,Bug Collecting Patch: check.
2,30,Candace,I'm going to hurl!
2,30,Phineas,Motion Sickness Patch: Check!
2,30,Candace,The Paisley Sideburn Brothers! Let's hurry!
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Ready to fire. (Perry flings the screw out of one of the holes of the trap with his tail. It hits the inator and then hits Doof in the eye.) Ow! (He suddenly turns the inator aiming it at the trap. The metal bars turn into broccoli. Perry jumps onto Doof.) Ow! Yeah! Oh! (Perry pushes Doof's face into the inator several times.) Quit it, you annoying little pest! (The inator fires.)"
2,30,Phineas,Last one!
2,30,Phineas,Woohoo!
2,30,Phineas,"Wow, that was fun."
2,30,Candace,Fun?! Are you nuts?! And how did a rollercoaster turn into broccoli?! And why broccoli?! How does that make any sense?!
2,30,Phineas,"Candace, focus. You've still got five minutes and it's 20 blocks away. So, uh...good luck with that. (gives her the log)"
2,30,Candace,"No, I can do this."
2,30,Phineas,Now that's persistence.
2,30,Candace,"I see the building and I still got three minutes! (She reads the directory.) Got it, 38th floor! (She runs to the elevator, but it is out of order) Out of order?! Okay, stairs. Step aerobics, don't fail me now!"
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,"Come back here! (Perry grabs a piece of the inator and bends it.) Oh, what are you doing down there?! (Perry activates it and salutes and gets teleported away. The inator turns into broccoli.) Uh-oh. Aaaaah!! (Groans and spits some broccoli out) Curse you, Perry the— (knock at the door) Coming."
2,30,Candace,Fireside Girl. Here's your order of cupcakes.
2,30,Doofenshmirtz,Aren't you a little old to be a Fireside Girl?
2,30,Candace,"Yes. Yes, I am."
2,30,Isabella,"(offscreen) Candace, we are all very impressed. (cut to inside) You earned more patches in one day than anyone in the history of the Fireside Girls: 49 patches, which pretty much blows away the previous record of 6 patches held by our own Adyson Sweetwater."
2,30,Adyson,"Aw, nuts!"
2,30,Candace,"No, I know I did all 50 and I made sure to plant the markers and everything. (holds up a marker) Huh? Looks like I forgot one. I'll just run back before it's five o'clock."
2,30,Isabella,"I'm sorry, Candace. Y'know, you may not have lit up the entire board, but you did demonstrate remarkable persistence."
2,30,Candace,"You mean I get a persistence patch? And that makes 50, right? (short beat) There's no Persistence Patch, is there?"
2,30,Isabella,Nope. 'Fraid not.
2,30,Eliza M. Feyersied,"Hold on, Isabella. Little Miss Sassy Mouth here gets a special patch for breakin' the all-time record. (salutes) Congratulations, Fireside Girl! And here's your ticket for the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert."
2,30,Candace,Let's go!
2,30,Phineas,Woo! Yeah!
2,30,Candace,Phineas and Ferb? How did you guys get in?
2,30,Phineas,"Isabella invited us. She's allowed to bring guests, you know."
2,30,Isabella,"That's what I kept trying to tell you, Candace, but you were so insistent on becoming a Fireside Girl. Maybe you can start working on your Good Listener Patch next."
2,30,Phineas,"C'mon, Candace, you can do it! Pin him already! (The gator continues to put up a tough fight. Phineas points to his watch.) We're running behind! (The fight continues) This is really putting us off schedule. (chomp) Ooh! That's gonna leave a mark."
2,30,Ferb,Yes. On the alligator.
2,24,Candace,Oh... my... gosh! I can't believe it! We're finally gonna have our first... (with Stacy) Spa day! Algae infused seaweed mud wrap...
2,24,Stacy,Hot rock rub and volcanic mineral scrub!
2,24,Phineas,Sounds like fun.
2,24,Candace,(surprised) Fun?
2,24,Phineas,"Yeah! Mud, seaweed, volcanic rock."
2,24,Candace,"It's not fun, it's relaxing. Which means it's enjoyable, which means it's fun. Grown-up fun. You wouldn't understand. Besides, the Le Rub de Scrub Spa is very exclusive. You can't even get in unless you know someone."
2,24,Phineas,How are you guys getting in?
2,24,Candace,"Well, I know Stacy..."
2,24,Stacy,"...and I know this neighbor who knows this hair-washer, who knows this bank teller, who knows this back-waxer who works at the spa."
2,24,Candace,"Yeah, and I know Stacy."
2,24,Phineas,Huh. Well Ferb and I aren't connected like you guys.
2,24,Candace,Come on. Let's get going. (she and Stacy walk away)
2,24,Isabella,"Hi, guys. Where you goin'?"
2,24,Candace,We're going to the spa.
2,24,Stacy,Yeah. We're gonna get totally immersed in self-indulgence.
2,24,Candace,And mud.
2,24,Isabella,Sounds like fun.
2,24,Phineas,See? I told you it was fun.
2,24,Isabella,"Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'?"
2,24,Phineas,"Well, I think we're going to build a spa. (to Ferb) What do you say, Ferb? It'll give you a chance to do your seaweed rap. You know... (imitating turntable scratches) Huah!"
2,24,Ferb,(blinks then rolls his eyes; pause) Okay.
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Bills, bills, bills. Ooh, half off at Slushy Burger. Keeper."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, what a little cutie. .... What's a cute little love bug like you doing out here all by yourself? .... I'll call you Mr. Fluffy Pants because you're fluffy and you look like you're wearing pants. Plus, you remind me of my Uncle Fluffy Pants."
2,24,Candace,"So what do you think? Soak, steam, sauna then shower? Or shower, steam, soak then sauna?"
2,24,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
2,24,Candace,"Hi, Yumemy. Uh, uh, I mean..."
2,24,Stacy,"Hi, Jeremy."
2,24,Jeremy,I'm on my way to build houses for charity. You girls want to come with?
2,24,Stacy,"Oh, we can't because we're going to the... (Candace quickly elbows her) Ow!"
2,24,Candace,"Oh, wow, philanthropy."
2,24,Stacy,But what about the... (Candace elbows her again; she falls to the ground) Ow!
2,24,Jeremy,"Uh, it's okay, Candace, if you guys are too busy."
2,24,Stacy,"Hey, what was that all about?"
2,24,Candace,"Uh, please hold. (to Stacy) Look, I don't want him knowing about the whole spa thing. He'll think all I care about is myself."
2,24,Jeremy,Candace.
2,24,Candace,"Uno momento, por favor. (to Stacy) Look, look, we'll go ""help people"" for, like, 15 minutes and then we'll go to the spa."
2,24,Jeremy,Candace.
2,24,Candace,Your call is very important to us and will be answered in the order received. (to Stacy) We'll still be able to make to our spa day.
2,24,Jeremy,"Candace, if you'd rather have a spa day..."
2,24,Candace,"You heard spa day? Because I said, ""Hurrah day"". Like, ""Hurrah, I can't wait to build houses."" That's what we're doing, right?"
2,24,Phineas,"Salt scrub. Nice, nice. Milk bath. Good. Hey, where's Buford with the seaweed?"
2,24,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, the volcanic rock is here."
2,24,Delivery Man 1,"Yeah, you're going to want to let this cool down a bit before you use it."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, he's such a cute little kitty. That's right. That's right. He loves his tuna fish. Yes, you eat that and I'll be over here working on my latest project. (pushes a button; chuckles) I'm painting."
2,24,Mr. Fluffy Pants,(Meows)
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Aw, I see you found my blueprints."
2,24,Mr. Fluffy Pants,(Purrs)
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"You like those? You like...? (the little kitty proceeds to start shredding the blueprints) No! No, not my blueprints! (beeping) No!"
2,24,Mr. Fluffy Pants,(Jumps up and down on the controller.)
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, no. What are you doing? I worked all... (blubbering) No, not the Gloom-inator! No, no. Get off, get off."
2,24,Woman,"Wow. I hope it doesn't rain on us. (sighs) Anyway, I want to thank you all for volunteering today. Now, if I could have you two on drywall duty. And, you, you're on baseboard duty. (to Jeremy) And I could use you on conduit duty."
2,24,Candace,Let's go.
2,24,Woman,"Oh, sorry, girls. I've got you two earmarked for nail duty."
2,24,"Stacy, Candace",Yay!
2,24,Woman,And that doesn't mean manicures.
2,24,"Stacy, Candace",Aw.
2,24,Phineas,"Heh, don't worry, Ferb. Your secret's safe with me. Don't we have one more truck coming?"
2,24,Delivery Man 2,"Excuse me, we have a delivery for Phineas Flynn."
2,24,Phineas,That's me.
2,24,Delivery Man 2,We've got 18 cases of cucumbers right here. (camera pans to the aforesaid cases)
2,24,Delivery Man 3,"Say, aren't you a little young to order all this?"
2,24,Delivery Man 2,"Yes, yes, he is. (to Phineas) Sorry, Phineas, he's new."
2,24,Phineas,"No problem, welcome to the job. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,24,Major Monogram,"Uh, say, Carl, have you seen my parachute pants?"
2,24,Carl,"Yes, they're very nice, sir."
2,24,Major Monogram,That's not what I meant.
2,24,Carl,"I know, sir, I was making a joke."
2,24,Major Monogram,"Oh, that's.... Of course. That's very funny."
2,24,Carl,"Thank you, sir."
2,24,Major Monogram,"So, where are they?"
2,24,Carl,I'll go get them.
2,24,Major Monogram,"Agent P, you're... you're here. Ahem. The, uh, Tri-State Area is mired in gloom and we believe Doofenshmirtz is behind it. We thought he retired the Gloom-inator, so this one is a big question mark. I'm sure you'll know what to do, Agent P."
2,24,Carl,Did you want the ones with the triangles or the imitation paint splatters?
2,24,Major Monogram,Triangles. And make it snappy. (pauses) I got the urge to pop and lock.
2,24,Stacy,Let's hurry up so we don't miss our appointment.
2,24,Candace,"Oh, hey, Jeremy."
2,24,Jeremy,"How's it going, girls?"
2,24,Candace,"Oh, you know, we're just over here helping and being all buildery and stuff."
2,24,Jeremy,Cool beans. I'll let you get back to it.
2,24,Candace,"Yeah, cool beans. Cool legumes. (accidentally hits a hammer on one of Stacy's fingers)"
2,24,Stacy,Ow!
2,24,Candace,"Okay, we'll just finish this wall and then we'll be able to make it to the... (lets go of a ply-board she was holding and then waves) Oh, hi, Jeremy."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, don't touch the... Oh, get away from that, you bad, bad kitty. No, not the Erase-inator."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,Not the Bigger-inator.
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"(while gesturing and waving his arms around) No, no. You think I did all this..."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"It wasn't me, I tell you. (points to Mr. Fluffy Pants) It was Mr. Fluffy Pants."
2,24,Doofenshmirtz,"Who never actually wore any pants. Come to think of it, I don't know why we called him that."
2,24,Candace,"Oh, Stacy, don't you just love how Jeremy buckles his tool belt on the third loop?"
2,24,Stacy,(muffled cries)
2,24,Candace,"(dreamily) Me, too. We're so gonna get married some day. Did I tell you what we're gonna name our kids? Xavier and Amanda."
2,24,Stacy,"That's it! Our appointment's in five minutes, and I'm going with or without you."
2,24,Woman,"Oh, are you leaving? I was kind of hoping that maybe you could help me with a teensy-weesny little task. I need that slab of concrete turned into rubble by sundown. You don't mind, right? I mean... After all, it is for the less fortunate. Thanks, I knew I could count on you."
2,24,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. I just finished my side of the house and I'm heading home. It was nice hanging out with you all day."
2,24,Candace,"Bye, Jeremy. It was nice hanging out with you, too. All day. (giggles) Did you hear that? We hung out all day."
2,24,Stacy,"(while causing a mess with the jackhammer) Ah, help me!"
2,24,Candace,I'm coming. Stacy!
2,24,Stacy,Out of the way!
2,24,Candace,(screaming)
2,24,Candace,"I'm sorry we had to clean up everything destroyed and had to rebuild it, I'm especially sorry I made us miss our spa appointment, but most of all, I'm sorry for being a bad friend. I was just trying to impress Jeremy and I lost sight of..."
2,24,Stacy,"Okay, you can stop that right now. You're starting to sound like one of those TV show we like to make fun of."
2,24,Candace,"But, Stacy, I..."
2,24,Stacy,"Look, the way I see it, you prevented me from going to the spa, almost killed me with a jackhammer, dropped a wall on me, I've gypsum in my hair, and basically wasted my whole day. But you did it for love, so it's okay."
2,24,Candace,Really?
2,24,Stacy,"Yeah, remember that time in the third grade?"
2,24,Candace,You mean when you glued that hamster to my hair just to impress Billy Clark?
2,24,Stacy,"Yeah, it's just like that."
2,24,"Candace, Stacy",(sigh) Billy Clark.
2,24,Candace,"So, I guess we're even."
2,24,Candace,Oh.
2,24,Stacy,My.
2,24,Candace,Gosh.
2,24,Buford,It's not plugged in.
2,24,Phineas,"Hey, sis. Wow, you seem pretty wiped out. Looks like you two could use a spa day."
2,24,Candace,A backyard spa? You guys are so bust...

2,18,Phineas,"Ahoy, Ferb! Any sign of the great white whale?"
2,18,Candace,You guys better not be talking about me!
2,18,Linda,"Boys, can't you wait until we get the boat in the water?"
2,18,Lawrence,"Well, it's not actually called a boat, darling, it's called a sloop. When we're on sea there's no right or left, only port and starboard."
2,18,Isabella,So... which side has the restroom?
2,18,Lawrence,"It's not a restroom, it's-"
2,18,Phineas,It's called the poopdeck.
2,18,Lawrence,"Well no, actually, it's called the head."
2,18,Phineas,Really? Cause poopdeck makes much more sense.
2,18,Candace,"Dad, can we just get this over with? Jeremy's throwing a romantic summer soiree at sunset tonight. I'm kind of on a deadline here."
2,18,Lawrence,"Oh, don't worry, darling, it's only gonna be a three hour tour."
2,18,Candace,A three hour tour?
2,18,Linda,You can use the time to soak up some vitamin D.
2,18,Candace,Fine!
2,18,Lawrence,Candace distracted - check! Kids with the lifejackets!
2,18,Phineas,Check!
2,18,Lawrence,"Excellent! Family pet. Say, where's Perry?"
2,18,Phineas,"Oh, Perry stayed home. Baljeet's watching him."
2,18,Buford,"Hey Baljeet, what'cha doin'?"
2,18,Baljeet,I am watching Perry the Platypus. I promised to not take my eyes out off him all day.
2,18,Buford,"Well, this is lame."
2,18,Baljeet,"He's a platypus, they do not do much."
2,18,Buford,Maybe he needs some motivation. (Swings a baseball bat)
2,18,Baljeet,"No, no please! I have given them my solemn oath to protect the little monotreme until the Flynn family comes home."
2,18,Baljeet,What is that weird noise?
2,18,Buford,"I don't know, maybe a car alarm? (Perry stands up and puts the wristwatch communicator into his mouth)"
2,18,Baljeet,"Wait, I think it stopped. (The wristwatch communicator is still beeping inside of Perry. Baljeet and Buford look at him)"
2,18,Isabella,"Hey Phineas, what'cha doin'?"
2,18,Phineas,"My king-of-the-world bit. Hey, check that out!"
2,18,Phineas,And look at those cool flags.
2,18,Isabella,"According to my Fireside Girls manual each one of those flags has meaning. The blue flag means crab season and the yellow flag means hold the mustard, and that one, I'm not sure what that one means."
2,18,Candace,"Okay, who turned off the sun?"
2,18,Isabella,"Oh, here it is. The red flag with the black box means...storm warning!!"

2,18,Baljeet,He must be hungry. I will get him something to eat.
2,18,Buford,"Don't worry, little ducky thing, we're gonna take good care of you."
2,18,Major Monogram,"Is everything all right, Agent P? I'm sensing you're in a bit of a jam. Can you get us a better view of the situation?"

2,18,Linda,"Ugh, I think it's finally clearing up."
2,18,Lawrence,"Well, the ship held together pretty good, didn't it? (Cut to reveal Lawrence is holding the wheel surrounded by debris from the wreckage.) Of course, we'll have to re-attach the wheel (Cut to reveal the sloop on a rock.) and fix that, uh, giant hole. Now, kids, are you all right?"
2,18,Phineas,We're fine!
2,18,Isabella,"Hey, where's Ferb?"
2,18,Phineas,Are you okay?
2,18,Phineas,"Oh, there you are. And there's Candace!"
2,18,Candace,"Hey, what gives?! (She pulls the squid off to reveal a fish in her mouth and lobsters on her ears. She pulls the lobsters off and spits out the fish.)"
2,18,Lawrence,"(inspecting the hole) Whoa, this doesn't look too good at all. Kids, don't come up here! It's far too dangerous! Mum and I will fix the boat. Candace, why don't you look for some food? And, boys, you could find us some shelter if you like. We may be here for a while."
2,18,Candace,"A while?!!? You mean we're stranded?!? That means I won't get to Jeremy's party before the sun sets!!! We'll be stuck here forever eating rocks and bugs, then I'll have to marry a monkey and have monkey kids and name them Xavier and Amanda!!! (sobs)"
2,18,Lawrence,"And we'll love them anyway. Candace, the sooner we get started, the sooner we all get to go home."
2,18,Candace,Fine.
2,18,Lawrence,"Stay safe, everyone! (Linda waves)"

2,18,Carl,"Sorry, sir."

2,18,Buford,"Oh, boy!"
2,18,Baljeet and Buford,(running off) Ice cream! Ice cream!
2,18,Baljeet,"Oh, I almost forgot Perry. Come along. Let us get you a little treat. (Baljeet grabs Perry, who holds onto the grass.)"
2,18,Buford,Gimme a double caramel fudge.
2,18,Carl,Here you go.
2,18,Buford,"Ugh! Hey, this is butterscotch ripple! (A small door slides up on the truck with a lit arrow. Perry spits out his fedora, puts it on and zips into it.) Is this your first day on the job or somethin'?!"
2,18,Buford,"Hey, he didn't charge me! Rookie mistake."
2,18,Baljeet,I did not even get to—Wait?! Where is Perry?
2,18,Carl,"Glad to have you back, Agent P. You lost some time, but I brought along the escape cone."
2,18,Major Monogram,"(on monitor) Agent P, we've just received reports that Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the laundry detergent in the Tri-State Area. We want you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. You'll need to use your tracking device to find him before your delicious ice cream cone melts. (Perry salutes. An island appears on the screen. Perry lands on the island.)"
2,18,Candace,"(imitating her father) ""Oh, Candace, go find us some food."" Yeah, like a quart of ice cream is just gonna fall out of the— (The strawberry ice cream from the escape cone lands on her head.)"
2,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Ugh, where is Perry the Platypus? He should have been here hours ago. (Perry approaches him) Ah, Perry the Platypus. Well, y'know, I had a trap for you, but no time. (Grabs him and runs off) This one's a little complicated, okay? (He puts Perry in a chair in front of a screen.) You remember a few schemes ago when I couldn't figure out what ""Big Laundry"" meant? (A slide of Doofenshmirtz from ""The Lake Nose Monster"" appears on the screen.) Well, this! (Another slide appears) This is what I meant! I am nefariously planning to provide the entire population of the Tri-State Area with free laundry, (change slide) which will drive out of business all of the local laundromats, (change slide) freeing up prime real estate locations (change slide) for my newest franchise: the Doofenshmirtz Institute of Evilology, where in only six weeks, students can earn a certificate in mayhem, larceny, or Ponzi schemes. (end slideshow) And I'm here in this volcano on this deserted island 'cause I get all this free monkey labor. (Whip pan to reveal a bunch of monkeys turning a wheel around.) I control them all with my Monkey-Enslave-inator helmet. And all I had to do was build one of them, because, you know, monkey see, monkey do. Hey hey! (to a monkey) Yeah, you can't put the red clothes in with the white wash! You'll turn the whole batch into a big pink mess! (points to another area) Bright colors over there, you incompetent baboon! Literally. Okay, now what was I talking about? (Perry wheels the basket into Doofenshmirtz.)"
2,18,Baljeet,"Perry! Where are you?! Oh, it is no use. I fear he is gone for good."
2,18,Buford,Why don't you just buy him a new one? They won't know the difference.
2,18,Baljeet,You cannot just buy a—Wait. That gives me an idea!
2,18,Candace,"We don't need to eat. We need to get out of here! (tries to get a coconut off a tree) I swear, if I don't get to Jeremy's party— (A monkey appears from behind the bushes and kisses her) Yuck! Monkey cooties!"
2,18,Phineas,"So, what do you think of our shelter?"
2,18,Candace,(dusts herself off and shouts in her brother's face) CAN'T YOU JUST BE NORMAL FOR ONE DAY?!? All you had to do was make a little lean-to for survival.
2,18,Phineas,"Well, there's survival and then there's living. (Zoom out to reveal the entirety of the shelter. Phineas pushes Candace inside.) Let us give ya a quick tour. We've got everything we need to make our maritime mishap as enjoyable as possible. Here's our warm and cozy family room, a fully-stocked kitchen. We even have indoor plumbing."
2,18,Candace,You're giving a monkey a shower?
2,18,Ferb,"Yep, had to be done."
2,18,Candace,"Grrrr! Don't you realize I have a very important party to go to?! If you're going to all this trouble, you could have built us a bridge back to town!"

2,18,Candace,Or you could have built us a coconut-powered hovercraft!
2,18,Phineas,But Dad didn't ask us to build—
2,18,Candace,Or-Or you could have made a gigantic slingshot and shot us back to the mainland!

2,18,Candace,"(leaves) Oooh, you two are gonna be so busted!"
2,18,Phineas,"Oh, wait. No, Candace! Not that way! That's the— (Candace opens a door that leads to nothing and falls) emergency exit."
2,18,Phineas,"I was trying to tell you, it's not done yet. There's gonna be this whole slide thing that dumps you into the hot tub! We're waiting on some parts!"
2,18,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, Perry the Platypus! (Cut to reveal Perry raveling up a towel.) You put that down right— (He smacks him with it) Ow! Ow, that smarts! (Doofenshmirtz throws his shoe at Perry. Perry jumps as the shoe misses and hits the Monkey Enslave-inator off of the monkey. The monkeys all look angrily at Doofenshmirtz.)"
2,18,Phineas,"So, Candace, do you want a banana smoothie?"
2,18,Candace,I got you guys this time! There's no way you could dismantle your stupid tropical dream house before I drag Mom back here to bust you! (Candace walks out.)
2,18,Phineas,So... no smoothie then?
2,18,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow! Ow! Oh! (Doofenshmirtz comes out of the laundry basket dressed as a bride to Perry's groom. Perry lets him have it, but then jumps away.) That's right, run away, Perry the Pla—AAAAAAHHH!! (Doofenshmirtz falls into the giant washing machine. A bunch of monkeys on one side drop clothes into the machine.)

2,18,Baljeet,Ugh. Maybe they will not know the difference.

2,3,Linda,"Oh, hi boys."
2,3,Phineas,"Aglet, Mom."
2,3,Linda,"Aglet you too, Phineas."
2,3,Phineas,"No, Mom. The shoelace tip - It's an aglet."
2,3,Linda,How interesting!
2,3,Phineas,Yeah! Nobody seems to know the word. I wonder why?
2,3,Candace,"I'll tell you why! Because...it doesn't matter! You can live a long, happy life without knowing the tip of the shoelace is called a..."
2,3,Phineas,Aglet --
2,3,Candace,It doesn't matter!
2,3,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,3,Lawrence,"Oh, look at this, honey. 27, across, 5 letters; ""Where's blank?"""
2,3,Major Monogram,"Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has crippled the entire worldwide internet by spreading a so-called viral video over the whole planet. Watch carefully, Agent P. What you're about to see may be the masterstroke of an evil genius which distracted us with smaller schemes while secretly moving us into checkmate."
2,3,Doofenshmirtz,"I am a superstar! (Grunting, falls into toilet) (Toilet flushes) It won't stop flushing!"
2,3,Major Monogram,"Agent P, this is no laughing matter. We need you to find out what he's up to and stop him. Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is a new, high-tech device. It's called a Universal Delete Button. It can delete any file on the internet from every computer on the planet."
2,3,Carl,"(Laughs) ""It won't stop flushing!"""
2,3,Major Monogram,"Carl, I told you. There's nothing funny about a man in his underwear skating into a toilet."
2,3,Carl,"Of course, sir."
2,3,Major Monogram,"Now, limericks. Limericks are funny."
2,3,Phineas,The reason we called you all here today is to raise awareness for the aglet.
2,3,Isabella,What's an aglet?
2,3,Phineas,"Ferb, enlighten us."
2,3,Ferb,(Pulls down a chart)
2,3,Phineas,The aglet.
2,3,Isabella,"Oh, that's what it's called!"
2,3,Phineas,"Our goal is to bring the plight of the aglet to the world's attention. First, we'll use these shoelaces to make Aglet Awareness Ribbons. (French accent) Never forget the aglet!"
2,3,Baljeet,You are going to waste a whole day promoting aglets? Who is going to care?
2,3,Buford,"If you diss aglets one more time, I'll fray your head so bad, it won't fit through your shirt hole!"
2,3,Baljeet,Aglets. Yay.
2,3,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. The more you know about aglets, the better your life's gonna be."
2,3,Candace,No one's life will be made better knowing the whatever-you-call-it! (Walks off)
2,3,Phineas,(whispers) Aglet.
2,3,Man,"(Walks up to them) Excuse me, what did you say?"
2,3,Phineas,Aglet. It's that little plastic tip at the end of a shoelace.
2,3,Man,Aglet?
2,3,Girl,"(Off screen) Aglet?! (Runs up) Oh, Louis, I will marry you!"
2,3,Louis,Aglet.
2,3,Boss,(Runs up) The promotion's yours!
2,3,Louis,Aglet. (Poof) My hair's grown back!
2,3,Man #2,W-what's going on?
2,3,Louis,The shoelace tip! It's an aglet!
2,3,Man #2,(Gasps) I can hear!
2,3,Phineas,"Well, It seems to be working. Let's take it to the next level."
2,3,Stacy,"Oh, oh! And the part when the guy rollerskated into the toilet! (Laughs)"
2,3,Candace,"Oh, that was sort of the only part, but yeah, I was dying!"
2,3,Stacy,And everyone in the world saw that video.
2,3,Candace,I wish there was a viral video of me singing going around the world.
2,3,Stacy,I bet you'd become an instant star.
2,3,Candace,Yeah. An instant star.
2,3,Stacy,Yeah. You'd be bigger than aglets. (Reveals a ribbon on her finger)
2,3,Candace,"Wait, what? Why do you know that word?"
2,3,Stacy,Aglets are so in right now. Look.
2,3,Candace,(Screams)
2,3,Jeremy,"Hey, guys. I, uh, just wanted to come with me. (Shows his ribbon) To the big aglet concert."
2,3,Candace,(Screams)
2,3,Major Monogram,"(On radio) Agent P, your halo jump is a go. Go, go, go! Jump, and fall! Keep falling, and keep being a platypus! Visualize it, you're a falling plat- (Perry turns off radio)"
2,3,Doofenshmirtz,"Did you ever had an old box of junk that's been sitting in the attic forever, and you think: ""I bet I could just get rid of this whole box, and my life would go on completely unaffected of the loss of whatever would be inside like, for instance, an old forgotten video tape made in high school"". Look in the box, Perry the Platypus. Always. Look. In. The box."
2,3,Candace,Moooooooooooom!
2,3,Linda,Candace? What's wrong?
2,3,Candace,Phineas and Ferb are increasing public awareness of the shoelace tip thing!
2,3,Linda,Who knew people would get so worked up over aglets? (Reveals her fingers have ribbons tied on)
2,3,Candace,"NOO! (Runs to room, slams door; Knocking)"
2,3,Phineas,"(Muffled) Hey, Candace! Aren't you gonna come sing at the big aglet concert?"
2,3,Candace,"You may have infected everyone else with shoelace tip madness, but not me! They don't matter!"
2,3,Phineas,Bummer. It's gonna be broadcast all over the world. You could become an instant star.
2,3,Candace,"Okay, but they still don't matter!"
2,3,Phineas,"Uh, touché?"
2,3,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, this video is ruining my life, Perry the Platypus. I- I can't even go outside my own evil lair."
2,3,Man #3,"Hey, look! It's that idiot from the video! (Laughing)"
2,3,Man #4,(Laughing)
2,3,Doofenshmirtz,"And that's just my kitchen. What's this? (Gasps) A Universal Delete Button? Thank you, Perry the Platypus. (Light trap appears) Sorry, but deleting the video from every computer in the world isn't good enough. I have to erase it from people's minds too. Behold! The Read My Mind-inator! You see, whatever I think of appears on this screen in front. See? See? If I just hook it up to your Universal Delete Button like this... Violà!

2,2,Phineas,Ah. I'll never get tired of you doing that.
2,2,Phineas,"Awesome. (Chatters) Come on, Ferb. Fire one off."
2,2,Ferb,(Chatters)
2,2,Phineas,I wonder what that means.

2,2,Candace,"Stacy, it's been four days. (Rolls her chair to a picture referencing Cinderella. The faces are replaced with Candace and Jeremy's faces) I'm not expecting Prince Charming to bring me a glass slipper or anything, but a phone call would be nice.

2,2,Candace,"(Chuckles) I mean, what's up?"
2,2,Jeremy,I just got the new Destruction Mayhem 3 game. I thought maybe you'd like to come over and try it out.
2,2,Candace,"(Sarcastically) Oh, yeah, you, me, and little Suzy playing a video game, huh?"
2,2,Jeremy,"Suzy? No. She's at her friend's house. (The door knocks and he pauses the game) Uh, hold on, Candace. Someone's at the door. (Opens the door)"

2,2,Phineas,All set over here!
2,2,Phineas,Okay. Now all we need is our subject. Where's Perry?
2,2,Major Monogram,"Ah, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the lights. We're using an alternative energy source, and haven't got it working smoothly yet. I decided it was high time our operation went green. All right, assignment, assignment. Oh, let's see... We're saving paper by printing on the same one over and over again, so... Uh, sorry for the life on me. (Turns the paper, showing black ink all over it) I can't make this out. Hmm... Well, I'm sure it says something about Doofenshmirtz. Go get him!"
2,2,Major Monogram,"(Gets up and walks off-screen) For crying out loud, Carl, (Carl is seen pedaling the generator, panting) pedal faster. I gotta check my E-mail."

2,2,Phineas,"(Holding up a mic) Okay, Perry. It's time to hear what's on your mind. Hit me with your (Chatters) shot."
2,2,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! What'cha dooooin'?"
2,2,Phineas,Oh. Ferb and I invented a Perry translator so we can finally figure out what he's saying.
2,2,Isabella,That's great. (Her face becomes sheepish) But don't you need Perry to be here for it to work?
2,2,Phineas,"(Turns his head, noticing Perry is gone) That was weird. Perry was here a second ago."
2,2,Translator,"I sure love worms. (Phineas and Ferb hear this and turn to Isabella, thinking she said that)"
2,2,Isabella,Don't look at me.
2,2,Translator,"Big, fat, juicy worms!"
2,2,Translator,"Gotta find 'em, gotta eat 'em!"
2,2,Phineas and Isabella,Whoa.
2,2,Phineas,"Hello, birdie. Do you understand me?"
2,2,Translator,Aren't you a little young for inter-speciel communication?
2,2,Phineas,"Yes. Yes I am. How about you, squirrel? Do you understand me? (Points the mic at the squirrel)"
2,2,Translator,"Oh, I do. Do you have any nuts for me?"
2,2,Isabella,That's so cute.
2,2,Squirrel,(Squeaks)
2,2,Translator,"Yeah yeah yeah, I'm cute. I'm cute. Now, nut me."
2,2,Phineas,Wow. This works on all animals.
2,2,Isabella,"Hey, do you think it would work on my dog, Pinky? He barks at the door when a doorbell rings on TV. I'd love to explain the whole concept to him."
2,2,Phineas,Couldn't hurt to try.
2,2,Isabella,(Runs off) Great! I'll be right back.
2,2,Phineas,"Wow! With a device like this, all animals can finally say what's on their minds."
2,2,Jeremy,"I'm really glad you wanted to come over, Candace. Most girls really aren't into stuff like this."
2,2,Candace,"Pssh. Most girls. I guess I'm just cool like that. Yup, love me my video games. (A poodle pops up) Who's this?"
2,2,Jeremy,"Yeah, that's Suzy's dog. (Rubs her head) Who's a good girl? Who's a good girl? Yeah."
2,2,Candace,Yeah. Who's the good girl? Who's the good girl?
2,2,Candace,"Obviously, not me."
2,2,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Don't be shy, It's just me. Come here. (A cage falls) (Laughs) You like my new cage? I got it from a second-hand shark supply store. It was half off, because you know, something bit half of it off. So, here's my evil plan: With this remote, I will open the Danville Dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways! Like the canals in Venice, Italy! (Italian music plays) Or to a lesser extent, Venice, California. (Surf rock music plays) But how will people get around? They will have to buy my latest invention! It's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water. (Pulls the tarp) Behold! You like it? I call it the Buoyancy Operated Aquatic Transport, or BO-AT for short. Everyone will want one."
2,2,Phineas,"Yeah, I see what you're saying, but you don't have an argument. They're giving you 12 cans a day. Technically, you're not underfed. All right, next!"
2,2,Phineas,Oh yeah. I've been getting a lot of complaints about the vacuum. Just let it out.
2,2,Candace,"Hey, look at this. I'm getting the hang of it. (Game beeping)"
2,2,Jeremy,"No, actually Candace, you just paused it. (Game sounds) And now you've reset the game."
2,2,Candace,(Gasps) Oh no. These we're brand new.
2,2,Jeremy,"Hey, bad dog! That's weird. Suzy trained her so well."
2,2,Candace,(Suspiciously) I see. Suzy trained her.

2,2,Candace,"Yeah, yeah. (at poodle) (Gasps) Don't even think about it! (Gasps, throws paper towels into toilet)"

2,2,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. Ready for the third level? (Door slams) Candace?"
2,2,Isabella,Phineas?
2,2,Phineas,What's up?
2,2,Isabella,"Okay. We've got 78 complaints about food quantity, 42 requests for belly rubs, and we're still trying to explain TV to Pinky."
2,2,Milly,"Again, forget the idea of little people in there."
2,2,Isabella,"So, what exactly are we supposed to do with this information?"
2,2,Phineas,Hmm...
2,2,Ginger,Okay. The Jones's hamster is gonna lose it if someone doesn't oil the wheel in its cage.
2,2,Hamster,Hmph!
2,2,Ginger,"Well, what now?"
2,2,Phineas,"That's what we'll do. Let's tell all the owners what their pets want! Starting with this little fella right here. (hamster squeaks) Sorry. Lady. Lady right here. (at Candace) Hey, Candace!"
2,2,Candace,What is going on here?
2,2,Phineas,"We made an animal translator! We'll tell you all about it later. Right now we're on a mission. Come on, guys."
2,2,Isabella,"See ya, Candace!"
2,2,Candace,"An animal translator? I have had it up to HERE with stupid animals today! Why would you wanna know what stupid animals are saying? Oh, I can tell you what they'll say: ""I'm an animal and I bite my own heinie!"" ""I've got a small cranial capacity!"" ""Look at me! I don't have opposable thumbs!""

2,19,Boy,I did!
2,19,Phineas,Who are you?
2,19,Boy,Allow me to introduce myself. (Walks over to Phineas and Ferb) I'm Irving. I'm your biggest fan! (Chuckles)
2,19,Phineas,How long have you been sitting there?
2,19,Irving,"A couple hours. My horoscope says I'm a background type. (Raises book entitled ""P & F"") Check it out. I've kept a scrapbook of your adventures. (Opens book to a picture of Phineas, Ferb and co. on the rollercoaster) This is the time you built that rollercoaster . (Flips page to Phineas and Ferb on a Chariot at Paul Bunyan's Pancake Haus) And this is the time you built those chariots. (Flips to picture of Phineas and Ferb in the kitchen with Irving in the background) And this is when you had that soup ."
2,19,Baljeet,"(Scoffs) Oh, what a nerd."
2,19,Phineas,Is that a lock of Ferb's hair?
2,19,Irving,(Snatches book back) Don't touch it.
2,19,Phineas,Irving suggested hide and seek.
2,19,Buford,Isn't the house a little too small to play a good game of hide and seek?
2,19,Ferb,"Perhaps the problem is not that the house is too small, but that we are too big."
2,19,Phineas,"He's right! You kids hang tight while Ferb and I use the technology from our submarine adventure to make a new shrinking machine. Ferb, I know what we're going to do today!"
2,19,Irving,"(reverently) You said the words. Hey, can I say the Perry thing?"
2,19,Phineas,Wha?
2,19,Irving,"You know, when you say ""Where's Perry?"""
2,19,Phineas,O...kay.
2,19,Irving,"Where's Perry? Ah, oh wait, wait, I can do better. Where's Perry? Where is Perry? Wherefore art thou Perry? I wonder where that Perry went."
2,19,Irving,"Oh, where is that platypus? Where the P-man at?"
2,19,Major Monogram,Good morning Agent P. We've received some disturbing calls from Doofenshmirtz.
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello? Monogram...are you home? If you're home, please pick it up. Pick it up. Hello? Oh, I hate these machines. Okay, listen. I'm being evil and I need Perry the Platypus to come over and stop me. (Beep) Wait-- wait, did I hear a beep? Did the machine just cut me off? Oh-ah-oh I don't know what to do. You know what, I'm just going to call back."
2,19,Major Monogram,I want you to find out what he's up to and--
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Hello? I-- I think your machine cut me off before, what I was saying---"

2,19,Baljeet,"Oh no, she found me. I guess I'm it! (Screams as Candace opens the umbrella catapulting Baljeet to the ceiling, onto the lamp)"
2,19,Phineas and Isabella,Baljeet?
2,19,Baljeet,I'm okay!
2,19,Phineas,We gotta get that shrinker back!
2,19,Irving,You guys always have a plan.
2,19,Phineas,We don't have a plan.
2,19,Irving,What?
2,19,Phineas,We'll just have to wing it.
2,19,Irving,"There's no winging, there's no winging in the book. You guys have just been improvising this whole time? (Dramatically) Oh, how heroes fall!"
2,19,Baljeet,Hey guys! Remember me? Up here with the dead flies?
2,19,Phineas,"Sit tight, Baljeet! We'll have you down as soon as we can."
2,19,Baljeet,How can I sit tight? With that air conditioner up there freezing me! (Teeth chattering) So cold. So cold.
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Activate bug eye-bot. (The bug eye-bot activates) Yes, my little robot eye, find Perry's address for me. That's right, walk towards the front door so I can see the number. Oh, it will be so delicious to know where Perry lives. I can ring his doorbell...and run away! (Laughs maniacally)"
2,19,Candace,"(singsong) Hey Mom?! I want to show you something! (normal voice, looks back) Yep, I'm one step ahead of you boys, one step. What the heck is this (presses antenna, shrinks) THIIIIIING! (Gasps) I'm shrunk! (Crashing noise as the shrinking machine falls next to her) Where's the reverse button?"
2,19,Vivian,Hello? Hello? I could have sworn I heard someone kno-- (Gasps) Oy. That's not a good place to put a toy.
2,19,Candace,"Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro! It's me, Candace! Helloooo!? (Screams and falls off ledge, onto the grass) Guess I deserve this for trying to be one step ahe-- (Screams, as she bumps into a growling caterpillar, which is shown to really be harmless after she runs away)"
2,19,Isabella,"Phineas, we've got to get to that machine across the street."
2,19,Irving,(Groaning) What's the point? We're vacuum bag filler.
2,19,Buford,"Thanks for that, Captain Bring-Down."
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"What? Some kiddie TV show? Agh, the signal must have gotten switched. (Presses buttons) Aw, and now I've lost the picture entirely. (Pause) Hm. I hope it doesn't go rogue."
2,19,Phineas,What is that thing? Did we ever make mechanical bugs?
2,19,Irving,There's nothing in the book.
2,19,Phineas,"Okay everyone, split off now!"
2,19,Phineas,Thread 'em and throw 'em guys!
2,19,Buford,"Come on, Fanboy, you want to live forever?"
2,19,Irving,Is that an option?
2,19,Irving,"(As Isabella jumps down, pulls out the needle embedded in the table leg, and takes over for him; faintly) I'm okay."
2,19,Phineas,"Great job, Isabella."
2,19,Isabella,Thank you very much.
2,19,Buford,(War cry) Yeah! Yeah! (screams. He rips off the bug's robotic eye and holds it above his head before throwing it down to the ground)
2,19,Phineas,I couldn't have said it any better myself.
2,19,Isabella,"That was awesome, Phineas."
2,19,Irving,"Yeah, but guys? We're still small. What now?"
2,19,Phineas,"Ferb, you're a genius! Everyone on?"
2,19,Irving,"(Taking a picture) Hey, I don't have to digitally insert myself."
2,19,Buford,Go tell it to your blog.
2,19,Isabella,Let's get Baljeet.
2,19,Isabella and Phineas,Baljeet?
2,19,Isabella,Where is he?
2,19,Phineas,I don't see him.
2,19,Buford,"Look over there, something's moving!"
2,19,Everyone but Ferb,Ewww!Baljeet: I did what I had to do to survive!
2,19,Isabella,"Pinky, no! Down! Bad dog. Where are your manners?"
2,19,Phineas,"How are you doing there, short stuff?"
2,19,Candace,"Phineas, thank goodness!"
2,19,Candace,Who smells like fly guts?
2,19,Baljeet,"I had to survive, okay?"
2,19,Phineas,Come on! Hands on!
2,19,Isabella,"All right, Phineas!"
2,19,Irving,Cool!
2,19,Baljeet,"Yay, Phineas!"
2,19,Irving,"You did it, Ferb!"
2,19,Vivian,"Isa, is that you?"
2,19,Isabella,"(offscreen) Yeah, Mom!"
2,19,Candace,You guys are so busted! Wait 'til Mom sees this! (runs off) Moooom?!
2,19,Irving,(Giggles) She's gonna go get your mom!
2,19,Phineas,...What?
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,(Pounding his computer screen) Ohh. Work! Work!
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Come on. Ooh, hey, random pounding works. Oh good, we're back on the Perry show."
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Ahhh! All right, Perry the Platypus, could you just do me a favor and hold this up to the street address in front of-"
2,19,Candace,"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! You gotta see something in the kitchen! (grabs her arm and drags her, only to spill her coffee) Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
2,19,Linda,"Okay, Candace."
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"You think you're so clever, Perry the Platypus. But for the first time in my life I can actually use a self-destruct button that I have installed! Prepare to be vaporized, Perry the Platypus!"
2,19,Candace,"See, Mom?! See, see?! (Sees nothing on the counter) WHAT?!! But it was right here!!! I swear there was this machine...and we were tiny...but then we got bigger... (rest is under) and, and..."
2,19,Linda,"(with disdain, overlapping) Oh, teenagers."
2,19,Vivian,"Hormones, all it is."
2,19,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, that's done. And no comeuppance."
2,25,Phineas,"Okay, we finished the superstructure, but what we really need now is a tool that would fuse wood and metal out of a molecular level."
2,25,Baljeet,"Technology like that is twenty years away; you will need a time machine. Luckily, I have been working on a design. I have no field about all the quantum physics yet, but if you give me a couple of days..."
2,25,Phineas,Or we could just use the one at the museum.
2,25,Baljeet,There is a time machine at the museum?
2,25,Phineas,"Yeah, we took it back to the Mesozoic Era."
2,25,Baljeet,You got to hang out with dinosaurs?
2,25,Phineas,"Yeah, earlier this summer."
2,25,Baljeet,"Hmm. (sarcastic) Well, thank you for inviting me."
2,25,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Or I should say, I know what we're gonna do twenty years from today."
2,25,Isabella,"Hey, guys! Watcha doin'?"
2,25,Phineas,We're time-traveling.
2,25,Isabella,Can I come?
2,25,Phineas,Why not?
2,25,Candace,"(on the phone) Yes, Stacy. They're building something out there. But I decided the problem is I always drop the gun. So I'm gonna wait 'til just the right moment--"
2,25,Stacy,Hello? Hello?
2,25,Candace,They're on the move; I'll bust them now! I'll bust them now!
2,25,Phineas,"Twenty years forward, and away we go! (disappears)"
2,25,Candace,"So that's it! They're time-traveling again! And the best part is they have to return to this exact spot. And I'll be standing right here with mom to bust them when they do. Actually, right over here. I'll be, uh...crushed by the machine if I was standing there. And...I'm talking to nobody."
2,25,Phineas,"Here we are, twenty years in the future. Isabella, wait. You're the only one we can trust to watch the machine. (leaves)"
2,25,Isabella,(romanticizes) He trusts me... (leans over the lever and transports her in time) Oops!
2,25,Janitor,"(sees it) Yeaah, I hate cleaning that thing anyway."
2,25,Phineas,"Hey, I see the museum finally had that new wing. And would you look how Danville's changed... Hey, mobile homes, flying cars, jet packs... Hey, look at that! That looks like...it is! It's Candace twenty years older! I almost didn't recognize her—she looks so relaxed. And those must be her kids in the yard."
2,25,Amanda,"I can't believe you, Xavier and Fred. You two are so lazy; it's summer vacation and you're wasting it! You guys never do anything!"
2,25,Xavier,"Well, I'm sitting under this digital tree."
2,25,Fred,And I'm sitting next to him.
2,25,Amanda,(to Future Candace) Do you see your two sons out there doing nothing? They never do anything!
2,25,Future Candace,"Oh honey, don't exaggerate. I wish you would just get along. Your uncles Phineas and Ferb and I were great friends as children."
2,25,Phineas,The future. (sees Xavier and Fred) Hi guys. Whatcha doin'?
2,25,Xavier,I'm sitting under this digital tree.
2,25,Fred,And I'm sitting next to him.
2,25,Future Candace,"(on the phone) Oh Stacy, every job has its problems. But there's gotta be an upside to being president of Uruguay. No, huh. Me? I'm fine, the kids are fine. Xavier and Fred are in the backyard with young Phineas and Ferb. (realizes) YOUNG Phineas and Ferb?! Gotta go, Stacy. Good luck with that llama legislation."
2,25,Xavier,"...and yesterday, I was sitting on the left."
2,25,Fred,And I was sitting next to him...
2,25,Xavier,...on the right. We like to mix it up.
2,25,Future Candace,"It IS them! I bet they traveled here from the past. (climbs up the tree) Ohh, look how cute and... BUSTABLE they look. Wait, isn't this just a digital tree? (falls down) AAH!"
2,25,Xavier,Hey mom.
2,25,Phineas,"Hi, Candace..."
2,25,Future Candace,AAAAAHHH!!! I'm telling MOM!
2,25,Phineas,"Hey, that reminds me. Where's Perry?"
2,25,Future Doofenshmirtz,"I finally got you, Perry the Platypus. The end game is finally he-ere. (plays checkers) Oh wait, I moved one piece. (sees Future Perry sleeping) I'll just put it back."
2,25,Phineas,"So, what spectacular adventures have you got lined up this summer?"
2,25,Xavier,I'm sitting under this digital tree.
2,25,Fred,And I'm sitting next to him.
2,25,Phineas,That's it? But it's summer vacation and you're free to do anything!
2,25,Xavier,"Yeah, but this is the future and everything's already been done."
2,25,Phineas,"The stone age was once the future, as was the Middle Ages. Creativity and inventions never end! There's a whole bunch of stuff you can do this summer."
2,25,(Song,"2nd Verse of ""Today is Gonna Be a Great Day"")"
2,25,♪ Like Maybe,♪
2,25,Phineas,"Thanks a lot, guys."
2,25,Jaret Reddick,"No prob, we appreciate the gig."
2,25,Phineas,"(to Xavier and Fred) Bowling for Soup. Ehh, before their time. So, what are you guys gonna make this summer? How about, uh... Bumper cars that move over five dimensions?"
2,25,Xavier,"Oh yeah. Okay, we'll do that."
2,25,Phineas,"Fun! We'd love to stay and help, but we've gotta find a wood-and-steel-fusing tool."
2,25,Xavier,Fred's got one.
2,25,Fred,I'm sitting on it.
2,25,Xavier,I'm sitting next to it.
2,25,Phineas,Fantastic. Thanks guys! Have a good future! (leaves)
2,25,Xavier,I like that kid.
2,25,Fred,I like the kid standing next to him!
2,25,Future Candace,"Mom, you gotta come with me right now."
2,25,Future Linda,"I can't right now, dear. I'm getting ready for my tour. It's my come back, come back, come back, come back..."
2,25,Future Candace,Mom.
2,25,Future Linda,"...come back, come back, come back..."
2,25,Future Candace,Are you finished?
2,25,Future Linda,Wait. Come back tour. Two more come back tours and I get a free pie.
2,25,Future Candace,(pulls Linda) Come on.
2,25,Phineas,That's funny. What happened to the...
2,25,Isabella,"I did, it's the time machine that moved. I brought back a woolly mammoth's tusk, a viking helmet, and smallpox. And the vaccine."
2,25,Phineas,Cool. Let's make like a banana and burn our molecules to the space time continuum.
2,25,Future Candace,They weren’t at my house so they must be here.
2,25,Future Linda,"Honey, I can't move as fast as I used to."
2,25,Future Candace,"There! No, wait... (time machine disappears) Too late. Mom!!"
2,25,Future Linda,I always loved this old bone.
2,25,Future Candace,"Mom! You never saw them and you still never see them! It's unfair, it's unfair, it's unfair!"
2,25,Future Linda,"Candace, you're a grown woman. I really thought you had finally moved past all this nonsense."
2,25,Candace,"Come on, mom. Hurry!"
2,25,Linda,"This is great Candace, really. But I have lots to do today."
2,25,Candace,"Here, see? The time machine is gone! Mom?"
2,25,Phineas,"Oh hi, Candace."
2,25,Candace,Mom! Mom!
2,25,Linda,"Look, Candace. They're putting a new bone on display."
2,25,Candace,"Oh, you missed it again!"
2,25,Phineas,"Hi, mom!"
2,25,Linda,"Oh hi, boys."
2,25,Phineas,"Wow, imagine the size of the creature that bone came from."
2,25,Linda,"I know, huh?"
2,25,Candace,"No, can't you see? They're time-traveling!"
2,25,Linda,This obsession with the boys has gone on too long. You need to stop. (walks away)
2,25,Candace,"I won't stop, never, never, never!!"
2,25,Future Candace,I was so close to busting them.
2,25,Professor Onassis,"Great Bertha's bloomers, I've done it! I, Professor Onassis, have invented a time machine! Excuse me, future female of the species, have corn dogs been invented yet?"
2,25,Future Candace,Yes.
2,25,Professor Onassis,Hot dog. I'm stayin'.
2,25,Amanda,"(on the phone) Okay, so Sharron's internet feed conks out right in the middle of math class. Wait, my mom's calling. Hi, mom. What's the fuzz?"
2,25,Future Candace,"Amanda, I'm taking a short trip today. While I'm away, you're in charge."
2,25,Amanda,"(to the boys) I'm in charge! Wait, what are you doing?"
2,25,Fred,Nothing!
2,25,Amanda,I knew it! You never do anything!
2,25,Future Candace,"Now where do I go? More importantly when? I know, I'll set it for a day I know I can bust the boys. Back to the first day of that summer. The day they built the rollercoaster. (disappears)"
2,25,Future Janitor,"(sees it) Sometimes it's here, sometimes it's not. What do I care?"
2,25,Pedro,Phineas and Ferb got a rollercoaster? Think we could get a discount if we bring the flier?
2,25,Kid 2,Maybe we better take it.
2,25,Past Candace,"There! Look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy! I told you!"
2,25,Past Linda,And you're not crazy because...?
2,25,Past Candace,(looks at the post where the poster was) AAAAAHHH!!
2,25,Future Candace,"The poster's missing, right? Follow me. (drags Linda out)"
2,25,Past Linda,"(sees the coaster) OH MY STARS! Phineas and Ferb made THAT?!? It's horribly unsafe and dangerous! (on the phone) Hello, police?! Fire department?! Army?! Air force?! Marines?! ANYONE?! SAVE MY SONS!!!"
2,25,Past Doofenshmirtz,It's no use! It's no use; we are doooooomed!
2,25,Intercom,"This is Base to Chopper One, some kids built a rollercoaster through downtown."
2,25,Pilot,It's be—Roger that.
2,25,Past Doofenshmirtz,(jumps to safety) I'm ALIVE!!!
2,25,Intercom,"Roger, got the kids, bringing 'em down now."
2,25,Past Linda,"Phineas, Ferb! You two are in SO much trouble!"
2,25,Past Candace,Yes! Yes!
2,25,Future Candace,My work here is done. (at the time machine) Back to the future. (disappears)
2,25,Janitor,"(sees it) First day on the job, and I'm already seeing things."
2,25,Future Candace,"(becoming the BAD FUTURE Candace) Oh thank goodness, it's great to be back... Home? (sees the strange future) Welcome to Danville? (looks around) Uh-oh."
2,25,BAD Future Candace,I can't believe this is Danville. Hello? What happened to the museum?
2,25,Man,"Didn't you get the new ShmirtzMail? It's the new doofen-law. Law number six million and seven: ""All museums that aren't about Doofenshmirtz are to be dismantled."" Hey, why aren't you wearing your lab coat?"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Uhh, I've gotta go see my children. (leaves)"
2,25,Man,Children? There are no children allowed anymore.
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"How long have I been away? That's strange. Joe's, Joe's, Joe's, Joe's..."
2,25,Joe #1,Hi Joe.
2,25,Joe #2,"Hello, Joe."
2,25,Joe #3,"(to Bad Future Candace) Pardon me, Joe. You haven't seen my wife Joe, or my friends Joe and Joe?"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Uhh, no?"
2,25,Joe #3,"Thanks anyway, Joe."
2,25,Bad Future Candace,Why is everyone named Joe?
2,25,Joe #4,(laughs) Why else? So Emperor Doofenshmirtz need not bother remembering names.
2,25,Bad Future Candace,And who is...?
2,25,Joe #4,(Gasps) I said too much. I said too much! AAAAHHH!!
2,25,Bad Future Candace,Who the heck is Doofenshmirtz?! (goes to a library) That's odd. I've got to find out what happened in the last twenty years. (activates a hologram projector)
2,25,Voice,"Our glorious dystrophy began one summer afternoon when two local boys were caught building and riding a dangerous rollercoaster. The rightful reaction by concerned parents groups was to stop all creativity in young people before someone got hurt. Everything fun and unique was gleefully banned! Dangerous swing sets were re-made into dismal hospital beds. Coloring books were colored in ahead of time. And inside the lines. Eventually children themselves were child-proof and stored away until adulthood. Yes, oppressive beauty and happiness were gratefully replaced by the glimmering cesspool we wallow in today. A demoralized Tri-State Area cried out to be oppressed, and that cry was answered by one hero..."
2,25,Bad Future Doofenshmirtz,"(on hologram) Aagh, get back to work!"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,So this is all my fault! I've got to stop this.
2,25,Librarian,"Excuse me, Joe. Lab coat must be worn at all times."
2,25,Joe #5,"Sir, a woman just ran past your statue there without basking in your awful glory."
2,25,Bad Future Doofenshmirtz,"Aagh, come on. You're such a tattletale."
2,25,Joe #5,"Well, yeah. It's my job description; a tattletale."
2,25,Bad Future Doofenshmirtz,"Quiet! I need to address the populous. Attention, underlings! People often ask me: ""Doof, how does it feel to wield such absolute power?"" Well I tell ya."
2,25,(Song,"""Charmed Life"")"
2,25,Bad Future Major Monogram,"Agent P, another failed mission. It's gotten really hard to defeat Doofenshmirtz ever since we swore that oath to obey him."
2,25,Bad Future Carl,"Major Monogram, I've detected a temporal anomaly in quadrant four which means a time machine was recently used there."
2,25,Bad Future Major Monogram,"That's it! Agent P, you've got to get to that time machine and go back to the past, right before that giant tin foil ball put you in a full body cast for eighteen months. That's when Doofenshmirtz got the upper hand and it's been downhill ever since. This is our chance to fix it."
2,25,Bad Future Doofenshmirtz,"Oh wait, Perry the Platypus. Change of plans; instead of doing that, DON'T. All right, see you later. Remember the oath!"
2,25,Bad Future Major Monogram,Curse that oath!
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"What? Where's that time machine? Excuse me, where's everything from the museum?"
2,25,Joe #6,"It's all in the city dump, Joe. Let's go. (leaves)"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"(removes the stuff above the machine) Back to the past, back to the past, back to the past! (disappears)"
2,25,Man,Looks like this good a spot to start a dump.
2,25,Man #2,"Yeah, works for me."
2,25,Future Candace,W-Wha? A-Are you me? But I have to bu...
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Change of plans! Come on, I'll explain later. We can't let Candace see us. (Pulls Future Candace into a parking lot)"
2,25,Future Candace,But I'M Candace!
2,25,Bad Future Candace,So am I.
2,25,Past Candace,"(sees the rollercoaster) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom? Mom?! (runs off)"
2,25,Bad Future and Future Candace,"Ohh, I was so cute."
2,25,Future Candace,Why did you stop me? I was just about to bust the boys!
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Well, that's just it. I'm from the future where we DID bust the boys."
2,25,Future Candace,Really? How was it? Was it great?
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"No, it was awful. The future gets all messed up. Oh look!"
2,25,Bad Future and Future Candace,So that's how it happened.
2,25,Bad Future Candace,Get down!
2,25,Past Candace,"Look, look, look! See?!"
2,25,Past Linda,"(pause) Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at?"
2,25,Past Candace,(sees no rollercoaster) No! It's not possible!!
2,25,Past Linda,I'm gonna go get the cart.
2,25,Past Candace,"It was right here, and it was HUGE! (sees the rollercoaster fly away) Mom!"
2,25,Future Candace,"Wow, the future sounds so horrible!"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"It was, trust me."
2,25,Future Candace,"Okay, but coming from anybody but myself, I wouldn't listen."
2,25,Bad Future Candace,They're gone! Let's get back to the time machine and get out of here.
2,25,Past Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
2,25,Future Candace,"Okay, that was weird."
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Now when the machine is shot, how do we get back?"
2,25,Bad Future and Future Candace,Phineas and Ferb.
2,25,Past Linda,"Okay, we're here. Are you happy now, Candace?"
2,25,Past Candace,"(goes at the backyard) See Mom, I told you they weren't there!"
2,25,Past Linda,"Oh hi, boys. (At this point, Candace opens her eyes and her mood changes to shock)"
2,25,Past Phineas,"Hi, Mom."
2,25,Past Linda,"Come on Candace, help me with the groceries."
2,25,Past Candace,But-but-but-but-but-but-but-but... (continues)
2,25,Past Linda,Let's go. (pulls her away)
2,25,Kid #1,"Hey Phineas, that was great."
2,25,Kid #2,Way too cool.
2,25,Kid #3,That was awesome! Can we do it again?
2,25,Past Phineas,"Sorry, only one ride per customer."
2,25,Past Isabella,"That was great, Phineas."
2,25,Bad Future Candace,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. Remember? Three, two, one."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Wait, Candace! You're grown up, and there's two of you!"
2,25,Future Candace,"Phineas, we're from the future—two alternative futures. One that's good..."
2,25,Bad Future Candace,...and one that's terrible.
2,25,Past Phineas,Someone should really fix that.
2,25,Bad Future and Future Candace,We did.
2,25,Past Phineas,So the bad future no longer exists?
2,25,Bad Future and Future Candace,Right.
2,25,Past Phineas,"Well if it doesn't exist, shouldn't Candace from the bad future cease to exist too?"
2,25,Bad Future Candace,Oh darn. (disappears)
2,25,Future Candace,"Guys, I need your help. The time machine I arrived in is smashed to pieces. I'm stuck here unless you guys can build me one."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Ferb, isn't there an old time machine in the Museum of National History?"
2,25,Future Candace,"Yes, that's what you'll fix later this summer when we go to the museum. It's the one I took back from the future but now it's destroyed."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Okay. So the future time machine gets destroyed, that means the one here in the present is rarin' to go! We'll fix it, take you to the future, bring back the time machine, and we'll unfix it again. So we'll be ready to fix it when we go to the museum again."
2,25,Future Candace,"Phineas, I'm a fully grown woman and I didn't understand any of that."
2,25,Past Phineas,Just trust me. Come on! (drags Future Candace)
2,25,Past Isabella,"Wow, rollercoaster ride, and now this. Bonus."
2,25,Past Candace,(sees them gone) Wait a minute.
2,25,Future Candace,Are you sure you can fix this time machine?
2,25,Past Phineas,"Don't worry, Candace. We're almost done."
2,25,Past Candace,(hiding) Candace? Time machine? (approaches Future Candace) A-ha!
2,25,Past Phineas,"Candace, meet Candace."
2,25,Past Candace,"Awesome! I finally have proof! I'll take my older self, bring her to mom, mom will see the boys have invented some kind of time machine, and they'll be busted! Oh I love you, me! Come on, let's go! Let's get see mom! Come on! (laughs frantically as she tries to pull Future Candace)"
2,25,Future Candace,"Wow. Was I always this nuts? Candace, honey, get a hold of yourself. I have no interest in busting the boys anymore."
2,25,Past Candace,What?! But you're me! You have to want to bust them 'cause I'm never gonna stop wanting to bust them!
2,25,Future Candace,"You know, sometimes getting what you want isn't what you need. You'll find out as you mature."
2,25,Past Phineas,Ready?
2,25,Past Candace,"(mimics Future Candace) ""You'll find out as you mature""."
2,25,Future Candace,"Candace, just relax. Everything works out."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Twenty years into the future, here we come!"
2,25,Past Candace,Ugh...! (climbs up on the time machine as it disappears)<br /
2,25,Past Candace,"A-ha! If you won't show my mom what's going on, I'll show your mom! I'm all the proof I need!"
2,25,Future Candace,Candace!
2,25,Past Phineas,"We better go and get her. You know, that space time continuum thing."
2,25,Past Candace,"Mom has an antique store. Yes, it's still here! (the door opens automatically) Wow, future. Mom!! It's me, Candace from the past! I came here from the time machine that Phineas and Ferb borrowed from the museum. You gotta bust them!"
2,25,Future Linda,"Honey, what are you talking... Candace! You're so young!"
2,25,Past Candace,Mom! You're so ooollll....
2,25,Future Linda,Don't say it.
2,25,Past Candace,...lllllllddd....
2,25,Future Linda,You don't have to say that word.
2,25,Past Candace,...ddddd.
2,25,Future Linda,I mean it!
2,25,Past Phineas,Mom! You're so old!
2,25,Future Linda,(sighs) Hi boys. Aren't you a little young to be time-travelers?
2,25,Past Phineas,"Yes, yes we are."
2,25,Future Linda,"A time machine, huh? Does this mean that all those times you told me the boys were up to something, they really were?"
2,25,Past Candace,"Yes, yes, yes!"
2,25,Future Linda,"Oh, honey. I am so sorry I didn't believe you."
2,25,Past Candace,Woohoo! I finally caught them! (silence) Hellooo?
2,25,Future Linda,What?
2,25,Past Candace,Aren't you going to bust them?
2,25,Future Linda,"Candace, my Phineas and Ferb are thirty years old now. Well, I suppose I could call them, but Phineas is in Switzerland for the award ceremony and Ferb is in Camp David for..."
2,25,Past Candace,Bust them. Young Phineas and Ferb!
2,25,Future Linda,I don't think I have jurisdiction on these guys anymore.
2,25,Past Candace,"Grrrrr... (sighs) Okay, but officially, on record, they are busted. Right?"
2,25,Future Linda,"Sure, Candace. They're busted."
2,25,Past Candace,Yes!
2,25,Future Candace,"Guys, we see how time travel can mess things up big time. So promise me you won't go to the future again."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Yeah, maybe it is a bad idea. Just think: It all started because we needed that steel-and-wood fusing tool."
2,25,Past Phineas,"Hey Candace, you never told us. How do Ferb and I turned out?"
2,25,Future Candace,Fantastic. Just keep doing what you're doing and be nice to your sister.
2,25,Past Candace,"Yeah, be nice to your sister."
2,25,Past Isabella,Are you guys coming or what? (drinks soda)
2,25,Past Candace,Where'd you get that?
2,25,Amanda,So that's Uncle Phineas and Ferb as kids?
2,25,Future Candace,That's right.
2,25,Amanda,And that girl looks like Aunt Isabella.
2,25,Past Isabella,Did you hear that? Aunt Isabella! That means I'm gonna marry Phineas.
2,25,Past Candace,Or Ferb.
2,25,Past Phineas,Let's go.
2,25,"Future Candace, Linda and Amanda",Bye!
2,25,Future Candace,Looks like everything is back to normal.
2,25,Amanda,"Wow mom, your brothers are so cool. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with... Hey! Where'd they go?"
2,25,Amanda,"Xavier and Fred, what are you doing?"
2,25,Xavier,Nothing?
2,25,Amanda,See Mom? They never do anything!
2,25,Future Candace,"Give it a rest, Amanda."
2,25,Future Linda,"Ah, memories."
2,25,Future Candace,"I know, huh?"
2,25,Past Candace,"Oh man! In twenty years you guys are so busted! I guess that's a hollow victory... But it proves that you can be busted, so I'm never gonna give up! Never, never, never! Did I say, ""Never?!"" Oh, yes I did! Never, never, never! Never! NEVER! NEVER!!!! NEVER!!!! (runs off)"
2,25,Past Ferb,"Well, at least we know she mellows with age."
2,25,Baljeet,You got to hang out with dinosaurs?
2,25,Phineas,"Yeah, earlier this summer."
2,25,Baljeet,"Hmm. (sarcastic) Well, thank you for inviting me."
2,25,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we we're gonna do today."
2,25,Past Isabella,No you don't. Here's the wood-and-steel fusing tool you need.
2,25,Phineas,"Thanks. Hey, want a soda?"
2,25,Past Isabella,Thanks. (disappears)
2,25,Phineas,"Well, looks like we don't have to go to the future after all!"
2,25,Ferb,"Some other time, perhaps."
2,25,Candace,I'M WATCHING YOU!!!!
2,31,Baljeet,Do you find it as curious as I do that your menu has not changed since you opened in 1929?
2,31,Jeremy,"I know! It's awesome, right? It's our motto: Slushy Dawgs never get any better."
2,31,Baljeet,"Well, in that case, I--"
2,31,Buford,"(pushes Baljeet out of the way) Step aside, weiner! One Windmill Dog, hold the bun."
2,31,Jeremy,(produces Buford's order) Excellent choice.
2,31,Buford,You saved my life.
2,31,Baljeet,It was nothing. (notices Buford bowing to Baljeet's feet) What are you doing?
2,31,Buford,I am your humble servant.
2,31,Baljeet,What?
2,31,Buford,It's the Bully Code. I live my life by it. (produces a card and gives it to Baljeet)
2,31,Baljeet,"""If a nerd shood save a bully's life, the bully is the nerd's slave for life."" ""Should"" is misspelled."
2,31,Buford,Duh! It was written by bullies.
2,31,Baljeet,"That is very nice, but I do not want a slave."
2,31,Buford,"Too bad, you got one."
2,31,Baljeet,Goodbye. (departs)
2,31,Buford,"I will empty my mind of all thought, except for Baljeet. (stares at the ceiling for a moment) There, that was easy."
2,31,Baljeet,(walking along the streets of Danville) You are following me.
2,31,Buford,"At a respectable distance, little master."
2,31,Candace,"(from inside) So, what do you think?"
2,31,Stacy,What am I looking at?
2,31,Candace,"Duh, it's a new red shirt!"
2,31,(Song,"""Do Nothing Day"")"
2,31,Candace,"It's from Jeremy! He sent me a picture. (looks at picture) Aw, look at his cute, little wiener hat. Let's send him a picture of me. Make sure you get my good side. How's the lighting? (Stacy takes the picture) Wait, you took it while I was still talking!"
2,31,Stacy,Oh!
2,31,Candace,Let me see. (shows an ugly Candace) (gasps) I'd better erase that. (pushes button)
2,31,Phone,Picture sent.
2,31,Candace,"Oh, no! I hit the wrong button!"
2,31,Phone,Picture sent.
2,31,Candace,"No, not again!"
2,31,Stacy,"Here, let me see. (accidentally takes multiple pictures of Candace)"
2,31,Candace,"Stacy, no, stop!"
2,31,Phone,Pictures sent.
2,31,Candace,I'm ruined.
2,31,Stacy,"Well, he's at work, so maybe he hasn't looked yet."
2,31,Candace,"We've got to get to Jeremy's phone, come on, we're going to Slushy Dog."
2,31,Phineas,"(while Ferb is showing blueprints to him) Peanut butter and jelly robot races, masking tape mummy gymnastics, a jelly bean monetary system for emergenations...I don't know. I'm not feeling any of them."
2,31,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb are up to something, I'd better tell Mom."
2,31,Stacy,"Candace, the photos. (She pushes her away.) Eyes on the prize."
2,31,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,31,(Song,"""Disco Miniature Golfing Queen"" instrumental)"
2,31,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you on Canada Day, but the world's top evil scientists have been photographed leaving Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. Something big is going on, real big. I need you to infiltrate his headquarters."
2,31,Carl,(off-screen) Ahem?
2,31,Major Monogram,"Sorry. We need you to infiltrate his headquarters. Carl thinks I need to be more ""inclusive"". Find out what he's up to!"
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. Have you come to sign my cast? (over a close-up of said cast, with multiple signatures on it) Look, I saved you a spot right there. It says, ""Save for Perry."" Well, it was a bigger spot before I wrote, ""Save for Perry,"" but there's some room there. Grab that marker."
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha-ha! You've heard of the Internet? Well, this is uh... well, it's-it's just a net. But you're caught. (gets up and uses crutches to support him while he walks along) In exactly thirty minutes, the Tutti McFrutti ice cream man will park his truck in front of my building. I know, because I was standing there yesterday when HE RAN OVER MY FOOT! But today, I will reek my horrible vengeance! Behold, the Re-tire-Inator! Because, you know, he ran over my foot with the tire, and I'm going to hit him with a giant tire. Re-tire. It's not like a retire, like stop working. It's not that Retire-Inator. That's-that's actually over there."
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"I've got it ready. It's filled with crossword puzzles, and a big, fat, house cat that will lay on my belly and warm me into my...senior years. Anyhoo, where was I? Oh, yes. Evil laugh. (laughs manically)"
2,31,Buford,"Little Master, I've washed all your dust jackets and dusted all your cold knick-knacks."
2,31,Baljeet,"(over a shot of various foods placed on a bookshelf) Those are not knick-knacks! They are food, and they should be in the refrigerator!"
2,31,Buford,"Ohh, I have disappointed you, Little Master. I will strive to do better."
2,31,Baljeet,"Do not strive for anything, and I am not your little master."
2,31,(Song,"""He'll Do Anything But Go Away"")"
2,31,Buford,"I'll just fluff up your pillow, then! (Baljeet runs away) Little Master? Little Master?"
2,31,Baljeet,Stay away from me!
2,31,Baljeet,"(runs up) Phineas! Ferb! I saved Buford's life, and now because of the Bully Code, he is my personal servant! It is driving me crazy! You have got to help me!"
2,31,Phineas,"Okay, okay. We just have to get Buford to save your life, and then you'll be even."
2,31,Baljeet,But how?
2,31,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,31,Candace,"Stacy, I see Jeremy's phone."
2,31,Stacy,Where?
2,31,Candace,There! His message light is still blinking. That means he hasn't retrieved his pictures yet!
2,31,Candace,"Okay, let's just..."
2,31,Jeremy,"What are you two doing here? I mean, not that I don't like surprise visits from you, but this room is for Slushy Dawg employees only."
2,31,Candace,We're Slushy Dawg employees.
2,31,Stacy,We are?
2,31,Candace,Yeah. We did our training at the downtown branch to surprise you. (beat) Surprise.
2,31,Jeremy,"Hey, that's rad!"
2,31,Stacy,"Candace, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. What are all these buttons for?"
2,31,Candace,"It's hot dogs. How hard can it be? (gives Stacy some fries) Here, fry something. I'm gonna go etgay the onephay. (runs off)"
2,31,Stacy,"Ugh, you know I don't speak Spanish!"
2,31,Candace,(gasps)
2,31,Jeremy,"Oh, hey, Candace, I see you've sent me some pictures. I can't wait to check 'em out later when I take my break."
2,31,Candace,(fake smiling) Yeah! (frowning) No!
2,31,Stacy,I found out what all the buttons are for.
2,31,Baljeet,"Oh, yes. This thing is definitely the thing! What is this thing?"
2,31,Phineas,"This contraption, my friend, is completely foolproof."
2,31,(Song,"""Kronk for Hire"" (instrumental))"
2,31,Phineas,"Let me explain. You'll ""accidentally"" step on to that platform, which will launch you up and over that flight of stairs, where you'll be kicked and rocketed through a piece of sheet-rock onto a trampoline. Then conveyer belted up to a rotating system that will drop you onto a spring, bouncing you all the way to that red X, where Buford will be standing, waiting to catch you, saving your life."
2,31,Baljeet,"Ooh, I am thoroughly terrified, yet tingling with excitement!"
2,31,Jeremy,"(offscreen) Candace? (walks up to her with headphones) While I check the stockroom, can you take the drive-thru orders?"
2,31,Candace,"Ooh, my favorite!"
2,31,Candace,"(on speakerbox) Uh, welcome to Slushy Dawg, can I take your order?"
2,31,Linda,Candace? You work here?
2,31,Candace,Mom?! You eat here?!
2,31,Linda,"Honey, where are you? (waves) Can you see me? Candace?"
2,31,Candace,Uh— (walks over to Stacy) This is weird. My mom's here.
2,31,Stacy,"I think your brothers are, too. Across the street."
2,31,Candace,What are they up to?
2,31,Linda,(on headphones) Candace?
2,31,Candace,Mom? Mom! Drive up to the window! You gotta see what the boys are doing!
2,31,Linda,"The boys are here, too? Hon, I'm boxed in. I've got a heck of a line in front of me."
2,31,Candace,"Fill orders, fill orders. (takes and gives a bag) Hi, enjoy your meal. (to the next car) Come again. Enjoy your meal. Bon appétit."
2,31,Phineas,"Okay, Baljeet. You just stand on that platform and when Buford comes along, we'll guide him to the right spot. Although, it has occurred to us that you're giving up something really cool here."
2,31,Baljeet,What?
2,31,Phineas,"You're spending all this energy trying to stop Buford from being your faithful servant, when the reality is having the biggest, toughest kid in town (Ferb nods) as your personal bodyguard is a sign of supreme coolness."
2,31,Baljeet,Really?
2,31,Phineas,"Yeah, think about it."
2,31,Baljeet,"Hmm, maybe you are right."
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"(offscreen) Ooh, hear that, Perry the Platypus?"
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Tootie McFrutti has arrived on time! In a few seconds, he'll be flattened by a speeding tire."
2,31,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh no! Oh no no no! (The inator hits Doof's good foot.) OW!!! NO!!! Oh, my good foot! My good foot! OW! Ow ow! My bad foot! Oh, my good foot again! Oh, no, my bad foot—Oh, this is really a viscous cycle!"
2,31,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace, I'm takin' my break now."
2,31,Candace,Uh-huh. (laughs nervously)
2,31,Candace,"Stacy, we gotta get Mom up here so she can see what the boys are doing. Keep throwing food out the window! (she leaves)"
2,31,Stacy,Okay.
2,31,Candace,"Hey, Jeremy, can I borrow your phone? Thanks. Erase photos bust boys erase photos bust boys!"
2,31,Buford,"Little Master, Little Master, I finished color-coding all of your overalls. Whadaya want me to do next?"
2,31,Baljeet,"Well, first, I would like you to iron all of my books, then perhaps polish my retainer, then you can start my college applications. Massage my toosties. Sew my name onto my underwear, organize my book reports by subject. Ooh, build me—"
2,31,Buford,"Weenie! (Buford pushes Baljeet out of the way.) Alright, we're even."
2,31,Baljeet,"What? Aw, man."
2,31,Candace,"Ha! All photos erased! Now, onto the boys! (runs up to the gang) Hey, just so you know, Mom's on her waaaaaaaay— (Candace steps on the platform and the contraption activates.)"
2,31,Phineas,Oops.
2,31,Linda,"Stacy, you're here, too?"
2,31,Stacy,Yeah. Candace wants you to go out front to see what the boys are doing.
2,31,Linda,"Well, just give me a chili dog and I'll be on my way."
2,31,Phineas,Sheetrock. (Crash!) Trampoline.
2,31,Candace,No! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
2,31,Buford,I saved your life. Now you're my servant.

2,31,Buford,But the code! You've got no honor!
2,31,Jeremy,"Candace, wow! You okay?"
2,31,Candace,"Um, yeah. Here's your phone."
2,31,Jeremy,(flips it open) There's a picture on it.
2,31,Candace,No no!
2,31,Jeremy,"Hey, that's a great photo of you!"
2,31,Candace,Huh? Phew!
2,31,Jeremy,Now about your job...
2,31,Candace,No worries. I quit.

Its walls spring outward, revealing various miniature items including a fountain and a spiral staircase) Oh, nothing? Not even a sausage? No matter. (He pushes the button once again and the birdhouse folds back to its normal state) Wait until Linda and the kids see it. It'll blow their tiny minds. Well, not their tiny minds, that's not fair."

2,35,Narrator,"(The camera shifts to the boys who are watching the television show intently) Many believe that in the 1950s, a UFO crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico, but the scientists had no idea what the advanced technology was or how it worked. To find out, they used a process called reverse engineering. By closely examining the individual parts, they were able to build their own craft and figure out what it does, and how it does what it does. Way to go, reverse engineering!

2,35,Doofenshmirtz,"(reaching for the bottom button) This one should be the right—Okay...I....got it! (Perry gets released) Quick! (Perry jumps onto a cage and steers the skiff away from Mawenzi.

Evil story time! (sits down) See, I wrote my new evil scheme (holds up a book titled ""My Evil Plan"") in pop-up book format. Once upon a time, yesterday, like a quarter to six, (opens book to page of Doofenshmirtz sitting in front of a TV) I was watching a nature documentary, and I learned how before a baby's born, its constant companion is the soothing, steady beat of its mother's heart. Even after it's born, the sound of the mother's heartbeat (turns page to a happy mother holding a baby) continues to be a safe, calming beacon to a growing child, (turns page to an annoyed mother holding a grown man) in some cases up until their early thirties. Suddenly, I was struck with a brilliant idea: (turns page to a skyline with Doofenshmirtz's heart making a loud ""BUM BUM BUM"" sound) to project the sound of my own heartbeat across the city, causing all the babies to believe that I am their leader! Like the Pied Piper, except... with babies, (turns page to Doofenshmirtz leading a baby army) I will have a mighty baby army, a-and no one would fight back, 'cause, you know... they're babies! (turns page to Doofenshmirtz reading to Perry with the Nanny-inator and Bum-Bum-inator, a giant heart, behind him) Finally, the time came for me to tell you my evil plan in pop-up book form, and I- Oh, I- I'm sorry, the- the book seems to have caught up to us in real time, heh-heh. Anyway, behold! The Bum-Bum-inator!"
2,21,Phineas,"Rock's not about getting good grades and following the rules; it's about rebellion! It's about using music to express your true feelings and emotions! Just play how you feel! (Baljeet plays a single chord) Baljeet, that's- that's just an A chord."
2,21,Baljeet,I feel like I want an A!
2,21,Phineas,This is gonna be harder than we thought.

2,21,Stacy,Do you think you could teach me how to play the bass?
2,21,Coltrane,Let's see if you have big bass player hands. (they hold up hands to compare sizes)
2,21,Candace,"(from a bush, trying to imitate a bird) Bu-GA! Bu-GA! Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooka!"
2,21,Stacy,"Uh, excuse me for a second. (Candace repeats her ""bird call"") I have to go talk to my friend in the bushes."
2,21,Coltrane,Cool! I gotta go get this show started. Save me a dance?
2,21,Candace,"(still in the bush, still making her ""bird call"") Koo-koo-koo-koo-kooooo! Ki-KA! Ki-KA! (Stacy walks up to her) Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooka! Eega-eega-eega!"
2,21,Stacy,What are you doin'?
2,21,Candace,How's it going with you and Coltrane?
2,21,Stacy,I think it's going really well! He asked me to save him a dance!
2,21,Candace,He did? What do you think he meant by that?
2,21,Stacy,I'm pretty sure he meant he wants to dance with me.
2,21,Candace,Hmmm. Men and their impossible endless riddles!
2,21,Stacy,So how's it going with you? Has Jeremy nicknamed you yet?
2,21,Candace,No...
2,21,Stacy,Maybe Jeremy just isn't the kind of guy who nicknames people.
2,21,Candace,Huh. You could be right.
2,21,Stacy,"Look, here he comes now!"
2,21,Jeremy,"(greeting people as he passes them) Yo, T-Bone! Hey, Clammo! What up, Sassy Miss K? Momo! Binkie... (reaches Stacy and Candace) Hi Candace, where you been?"
2,21,Stacy,"I'll, uh... I'll see you later."
2,21,Jeremy,"Catch ya later, Staceroo. (Candace glares at him again) What?"
2,21,Baljeet,"Ohhhh, I do not know about this!"
2,21,Phineas,You'll be great! Just remember what we practiced: follow the beat and let your feelings out through the music!
2,21,Baljeet,I am about to let my feelings out through these pleather pants!
2,21,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I'm almost ready, Perry the Platypus. (pointing to a heart monitor on his wrist) This monitor takes my pulse and transmits it to the Bum-Bum-inator, which will then broadcast my heartbeat to all the babies in the Tri-State Area. See? (the Bum-Bum-inator begins beating.) You might say I'm wearing my sleeve on my... I- I mean my heart is wearing, uh... Never mind, whatever, you get it! Ah-ha-HA-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!

2,21,Buford,Uh... thanks? (Begins mimicking the beat; Phineas and Ferb start playing as well. Baljeet peeks around the curtain from backstage.)
2,21,Coltrane,"What's up, Baljeet? Your band is waiting for you onstage."
2,21,Baljeet,I can't do it! I just do not know how to rock! I know I am going to get a bad grade!
2,21,Coltrane,"Wait, what are you talking about, ""grades""? This is Summer Rocks! There are no grades."
2,21,Baljeet,"No grades? Oh, so it is pass/fail?"
2,21,Coltrane,No! We use a free-floating curriculum to encourage kids to just... rock out and have fun!

2,6,Wanda Acronym,"Ah. Agent Pinky, finally."
2,6,Major Monogram,"Ah, there you are, Agent P. I hear you took a wrong tube and ended up over in Wanda's division. Well, Doofenshmirtz has sent you a video message. Take a look."
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"(On video) Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. I'm sure you're getting this. I– I was hoping you would stop by today for some tea. See, I've got all these little tea things set out and ready and, um... Uh, please use the front entrance, Perry the Platypus, because– Uh, because, uh, all the other entrances don't work today. So bye-bye. I'll see you later today! Coming in through the front entrance."
2,6,Major Monogram,"So you see, Doofenshmirtz has invited you to tea. We don't know what it could possibly mean. We think– But don't hold us to this. We think that maybe, just maybe, it could be a trap. We do, however, like to give people the benefit of the doubt, uh, so try to have fun. Monogram out."
2,6,Isabella,"How's it lookin', Phineas?"
2,6,Phineas,"Looks good. And judging by my chronometer here, it should be just about time. There's only one thing to do now."
2,6,Baljeet,You mean test the resiliency of our cartilaginous collusion with vigorous application of weight and velocity?
2,6,Phineas,Exactly. Let's jump on it.
2,6,Candace,And now for the themed gelatin sculpture part of our get-together. Stacy.
2,6,Stacy,"I made a pair of shoes. You know, 'cause I like shoes."
2,6,Candace,"Nicely done. And how about yours, Jenny?"
2,6,Jenny,"Well, I fashioned this dove to symbolize my desire for world peace and a true—"
2,6,Candace,"Yeah, yeah. Get a load of my entry. It's Jeremy's head."
2,6,Candace,"Look, he's dancing. (She dance as gelatin Jeremy head wiggles)"
2,6,Jenny,"Hey, what's that?"
2,6,Stacy,Sounds like fun.
2,6,Candace,What?
2,6,Stacy,That looks awesome.
2,6,Jenny,We should go over there and check it out.
2,6,Stacy,Totally.
2,6,Candace,But that's just Phineas and Ferb and their friends.
2,6,Jenny,Don't be so uptight.
2,6,Stacy,"Yeah, come on."
2,6,Candace,"Nah, it's okay. Go ahead."
2,6,Stacy,"Well, if you're sure."
2,6,Candace,That does look kinda fun. Maybe I should... totally bust them for this.
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"This is nice, huh? You know, I was thinking the other day about how much better you would be as an ally. So I created this. I call it my Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator. Now, you just sit still. Okay, great. You know, after I turn you evil, we can use it to create a whole army of evil minions. Won't that be fun? Hold still. (Doofenshmirtz fires his -inator at Perry, while Perry dodges the rays) Hey. I'm beginning to think you don't want to be allies at all. I'm not trying to make it personal!"
2,6,Gelatin Monster,Evil!
2,6,Phineas,Who added the evil flavor?
2,6,Baljeet,It's curry. It's not inherently evil. Maybe a little spicy.
2,6,Baljeet,"Okay, I'm going home."
2,6,Candace,What the–?
2,6,Candace,Wait till Mom sees this!
2,6,Candace,(Muffled from inside the gelatin monster) You guys are so busted!
2,6,Phineas,"Well, I guess we gotta rescue Candace."
2,6,Holly,But do we fight a gelatin monster?
2,6,Phineas,We'll beat him the same way we created him: with water.
2,6,(Song,"Come On, Kids!)"
2,6,Phineas,"For Candace, our neighborhood and all the good gelatin left in the world!"
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, okay, I missed you several times, and I probably won't hit you anytime soon. I get that. But I must have hit lots of other things, and with a push of this button, those lots of other things will come to my side. And together we will defeat you!"
2,6,Gelatin Monster,Master!
2,6,Phineas,It's working. He's melting down the drain.
2,6,Candace,I have got to reexamine my life.
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Here they come, Perry the Platypus. Here they come, all of my minions. (He laughs) (A bar of soap and a toothbrush come to his side) I c– I– I could've sworn I hit more threatening stuff than this. Really, really pathetic."
2,6,Gelatin Monster,(Growling) Master.
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"Aha, a gelatin monster. I knew there was going to be something fun. Get him! Now you can bow down before my cartilaginous creation. It's so corrupt and cantankerous and carnivorous and, uh... Uh, low in calories and ca– Ca– Cow– Couch. Hm. Ah, that's all I got."
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,My Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator! My monster! No!
2,6,Doofenshmirtz,"My Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator! My monster! No! My beautiful, fruit flavored monster! You come back here, Perry the Platy- (He slips on the bar of soap, and the toothbrush lands in his mouth)Whoa! Oof! Mm. This isn't the toothbrush I use to brush my teeth."
2,6,Linda,"Oh, there's everyone. Candace, I thought you were having your dessert party today? What are you doing at Isabella's?"
2,6,Candace,"I got two words for you, Mom. Gel-a-tin. I am sick of it! Sick of it! Totally sick of it! (Snorts)"
2,6,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace, I heard you were having a dessert party, so I made you this out of gelatin."
2,6,Candace,"Aw. Nah, I'm still sick of it."
2,7,Grandpa Reg,"So kids, are you enjoying your visit to England?"
2,7,Phineas,"Oh, yes Grandpa. We even learned how to use real thatch."
2,7,Grandpa Reg,"Well, thatch terrific! (he laughs with Phineas) That was a good one."
2,7,Stacy,There's nothing to do.
2,7,Candace,Nothing for us to do.
2,7,Grandma Winifred,What? Why don't you read my old collection of Sherlock Holmes? I've got the whole collection right here.
2,7,Stacy,"Gee. Thanks, Mrs. Fletcher."
2,7,Grandma Winifred,Dinner's at 1900. That's 7 o'clock for you Yanks.
2,7,Candace,"Ah, yes. Reading. That's what they did before they invented fun."
2,7,Grandma Winifred,I heard that.
2,7,Candace,"Well, it's better than nothing. (Both she and Stacy begin reading) Hmm? Mmm-hmm... Hmm..."
2,7,Lawrence,"Okay, is everybody ready? We're going to take you kids to see the London Eye."
2,7,Phineas,What's that?
2,7,Lawrence,One of our largest Ferris wheels in the entire universe.
2,7,Phineas,Cool!
2,7,Lawrence,"Girls, are you ready?"
2,7,Candace,"Wait, wait, almost finished."
2,7,Lawrence,"Candace, you stayed up all night just to finish that book?"
2,7,Candace,"No, no. We finished the whole collection."
2,7,Grandma Winifred,"Before they invented fun, indeed."
2,7,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry? Oh, there he is."
2,7,Grandpa Reg,"See you later, old boy. Be good now."
2,7,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good here, in the UK. And, uh, after your last mission in London, we ran into some trouble with the British Spy Union. So joining you today is Agent Double 0-0. And joining me today is the lovely Inspector Initials."
2,7,Inspector Initials,"Double 0-0, you and Agent P will be assigned the same mission against Dr. Doofenshmirtz."
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,You realize this man is a Platypus?
2,7,Inspector Initials,"They're American, Double 0-0. Just be glad it's a mammal."
2,7,Major Monogram,"Ooh. Rrreow. Well, go get him, Agent P."
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,What? That's it? No files? No location? No contact? What kind of a mission is this?
2,7,Major Monogram,It was enough for the mammal.
2,7,Inspector Initials,Ooh. Rrreow.
2,7,Grandpa Reg,"Alright, you lot. Have a splendid day in London. We'll be back tonight after the International Haggis Festival."
2,7,Lawrence,There's twenty-nine individual flavors!
2,7,Grandpa Reg,Cheerio.
2,7,Linda,"Here are your tickets for the London Eye. You might want to get in line now, 'cause it looks pretty crowded."
2,7,Linda,"We'll pick you up around 4:15. Bye, kids."
2,7,Grandma Winifred,Have fun!
2,7,All but Ferb,Bye!
2,7,Phineas,"Candace, you know what? Ferb and I will meet you back here later. See ya!"
2,7,Stacy,"Bye, guys! (to Candace) Hey, let's go shopping!"
2,7,Candace,"Did you hear that? Even in England, my brothers have some scheme planned."
2,7,Stacy,How can you tell?
2,7,Candace,"You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to—Ooh! Stacy, that's it! Who did we stay up learning about? (she hakes her) Who is the total king of busting?"
2,7,Stacy,Sherlock Holmes?
2,7,Candace,Yes! Maybe I can finally bust the boys once and for all if I use Holmes's method of deduction! Come on. This will be fun! You could be Dr. Watson.
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,That's it. We're taking my car.
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"Now this is a motor car. It has pretty much everything. Radar, Subatomic Sonar, Nuclear Particle Response System, and a MP3 player. (Button beeps) Don't touch that, it's the ejector– (The seat ejects sending Double 0-0 flying out of the car, which eventually comes to a rest as Double 0-0 catches back up and retakes the driver's seat) And I suppose you think that's funny."
2,7,Candace,"By using Holmesian Deduction, we'll be one step ahead of the boys. We can get Mom and finally show her–"
2,7,Stacy,Ooh. Shoes. (Stacy stops at a storefront)
2,7,Candace,Stacy? I need you to focus!
2,7,Stacy,"Sorry, sorry. Got a little distracted there. You know, London, cool stores, shopping."
2,7,Candace,"There they are! Now why are they going into an auto parts store? Alright, Watson. Here's where the deducing begins. (she gasps) They've acquired a fleet of automobiles. And they're in there buying a bunch of little air fresheners for them. Or... they're buying motor oil for their giant robot! What do you think, Stace? Stace?"
2,7,Stacy,(returning with shopping bags) What?
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Oh, who's your little friend here?"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"I'm Agent Double 0-0, from Her Majesty's secret service."
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Double 0-0? I-isn't that just triple ""O""?"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"No, that's not how you say it."
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"It spells ""OOO"", does it?"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,It's just Double 0-0.
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"He's ""P"" and you're ""OO"", so together you spell-"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"No, they're not ""O""s, they're zeros. Alright?"
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"I was just going to say ""Oop"". Looks like I struck a nerve there!"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,Hey!
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"I must apologize, all of my traps are platypus-sized."
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,What about this then? (he motions to a large rocket engine above them)
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, that. You see, as I get older, I find it's harder and harder to read my small, little wristwatch. So, I will launch Big Ben into space, and fly it all the way to the Tri-State Area. (He demonstrates on a scale model) La-la-la, here I am, la-la-la, I just woke up and want to know what time it is – Yes! I am a genius!"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,So that– That's your whole plan?
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, in a nutshell, yes. What do you think?"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,Am I on one of those hidden camera shows? You realize you could just buy a bigger watch? Or maybe a wall clock?
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, but then I would have to drive to a store, and find a parking space, then you have to choose from, like - dozens of styles, I- It just seems like so much work. This will be much less complicated."
2,7,Candace,"(upon entering the auto parts shop) Okay, Watson. Excuse me sir, were these boys in here earlier?"
2,7,Worker,"Well, them two bics were 'angin' about an' they got a bit o' the bushies an', uh, also ran back an' carted off some ol' bangers that ah didn' need. Oi! Aren' they a bit harrish for them kind o' bushies?"
2,7,Candace,Stacy?
2,7,Stacy,"(Flipping through a Cockney for tourists book) I'm working on it. Ah! He said ""They were here, they carted away some junk from out back, and, aren't they a little young to be doing that?"""
2,7,Candace,"Yes. Yes they are. (Stacy and Candace enter the back lot) Aha! It's crawling with clues out here! Hmm... Look at these circular indentations in the dirt. (She sniffing) And the subtle scent of rubber in the air. By Jove, Stacy! What could it be?"
2,7,Stacy,"Uh, ""Free Tires""? (She looks at a sign advertising ""Free Tires"")"
2,7,Candace,"Maybe, maybe... We need more clues!"
2,7,(Song,Elementary)
2,7,Candace,"Stacy, I think I'm close to figuring it out."
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm going up to the top of the tower, I'm sure you two have a hot time together! (He laughs and exits)"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"Don't worry, Agent P. I'll have us out of these before you know it. (He activates a laser on his watch and begins cutting through the restraints)"
2,7,Candace,"There they are. (Phineas and Ferb get into a taxi that promptly pulls off) They dropped a notebook. The page is torn, but it says ""To big race 1600 Water S."" Water Street! The final clue! They're having a race at 1600 Water Street! Ooh, I gotta call Mom! (To her mom through the phone) And that's why you've gotta come down to 1600 Water Street. (She and Stacy arrive at 1600 Water Street which is nothing but an old abandoned building) Huh? I don't get it! I thought I'd figured it out."
2,7,Linda,"(On the phone) Hello? Hello? Candace, are you there?"
2,7,Candace,"Sorry, Mom. Disregard everything I said."
2,7,Linda,"Okay, sweetheart."
2,7,Grandma Winifred,"Remember, no snacking. Dinner's at 1900."
2,7,Candace,"Oh, okay. See you later. (To Stacy) What if 1600 isn't a place, but a time?"
2,7,Stacy,I didn't get that impression.
2,7,Candace,"Impression! Stacy, you're a genius. Wasn't it in one of those Holmes stories that they used pencil lead to reveal an impression on paper? Well, if my hunch is right... (She takes an impression of the missing half of the page) ""To do today: Big Ben race to Thames at 1600 for water slide fun""! Stacy, 1600 is 4 o'clock which is right now! Let's go!"
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,(firing his laser) Just a few more minutes.
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"Ow! Oh, there you go. Good thing I had the watch laser. Now Doofenshmirtz took the stairs, but if we work our way up the inner mechanism of the clock, he'll never see us coming."
2,7,Stacy,"Wow! Candace, you're amazing! You totally figured it out!"
2,7,Candace,"Yeah, I guess I did. Now, on to the busting."
2,7,Phineas,(Operating the water slide) Next!
2,7,Candace,Phineas!
2,7,Phineas,"Hey, guys! Do you like it?"
2,7,Candace,"I figured you guys were up to something. The tires, the pipes, I see what those were for, but what was with the pineapple?"
2,7,Phineas,"Oh, that was for Ferb. He was hungry."
2,7,Candace,"(mocking) Oh, and the butter too, huh?"
2,7,Phineas,"No, no. He's using that for speed."
2,7,Referee,(Inside the car) It's a new world record!
2,7,Candace,"Mom's gonna flip when she sees about this! (She starts dialing the phone, but the grabber takes her up the tower and she goes down the slide, screaming)"
2,7,Linda,"(answering the phone) Hello? (Candace tries to speak, but her speech is gibberish due to a bumpy area in the slide)"
2,7,Stacy,Can I take a turn?
2,7,Phineas,Go for it. (Stacy goes up) Last customer of the day. (He goes up too)
2,7,Stacy,"Whoo-hoo! (slides off, lands in Candace's car)"
2,7,Phineas,"That's what I'm talking about! (slides off, lands in car)"
2,7,Candace,Ooh! It's 4:15. Mom should be here. Mom! (bangs car glass) Look!Look up here!
2,7,Linda,(not hearing this) I hope the kids had fun today.
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"(On top of the tower) Well, It's about time!"
2,7,Candace,"Mom, look! Mom, Mom!!!"
2,7,Stacy,"(seeing Big Ben about to launch, taps on Candace's shoulder) Uh...Candace?!"
2,7,Candace,"Not now, Stacy!"
2,7,Stacy,But --
2,7,Candace,(she bangs on glass more) Mom! Mom!
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,(Doofenshmirtz laughs maniacally) Hey!
2,7,Doofenshmirtz,"(landing on the water slide Phineas and Ferb Built) Hey, look at this! It's like a ride! (part of the slide begin coming off) Woo-hoo! Cannonball! (The entire slide breaks into pieces and land in the water. Doofenshmirtz lands on the pavement) Well, I was expecting a bigger splash..."
2,7,Stacy,(Watching it all) Whoa!
2,7,Candace,Mom!
2,7,Linda,Here come the girls!
2,7,Candace,"Mom, you gotta– !"
2,7,Linda,"Oh, look at your cute outfit!"
2,7,Candace,"Mom, you gotta look at– (Candace motions towards Big Ben)"
2,7,Linda,"Oh, Big Ben! Gorgeous!"
2,7,Candace,(deadpan) But-but-but-but-but...
2,7,Winifred,"Ah, here come the boys."
2,7,Phineas,"Hey, Mom, you missed all the fun."
2,7,Linda,"Looks like we did. All right, let's catch a cab and head home. Come on!"
2,7,Phineas,Looks like Candace and Stacy did some shopping.
2,7,Ferb,I'll never understand fashion.
2,7,Agent Double 0-0,"Ah-ha! Well, that took longer than I thou— Wait! (He looks at watch several times and sighs) Oh, I wish I had a bigger watch."
2,20,Phineas,"Now this is a ship. My, she's yar. Is she ready to sail?"
2,20,Ferb,She's shipshape in Bristol fashion.
2,20,Phineas,What does that mean?
2,20,Ferb,"What does ""yar"" mean?"
2,20,Baljeet,Phineas! Ferb! I need your help!
2,20,Phineas,"(As he and Ferb pulley themselves down to ground level) Hey, Baljeet. I thought your friend Mishti was visiting from India."
2,20,Baljeet,She is. But- she is different now.
2,20,Phineas,Different how? Did she turn into a werewolf or something?
2,20,Baljeet,"No, she is- a girl!"
2,20,Phineas,She was probably a girl the whole time.
2,20,Baljeet,"Let me explain. Four years ago, back in India, we used to have such a good time together."
2,20,Young Mishti,Give it to me!
2,20,Young Baljeet,"No, no, no! Me! Give it to me!"
2,20,Young Mishti,"No, me, me! (Baljeet shoves her out of the way. She promptly does the same thing to him.) I'm open!"
2,20,Phineas,And she never ever showed any kind of sign of werewolfism at all?
2,20,Baljeet,"If we could just stick to the topic, please. Five minutes and forty-eight seconds ago, back in my home..."
2,20,Baljeet's mother,(offscreen) Baljeet! The Patels are here!
2,20,Baljeet,Coming! Misht-aah...!
2,20,Mishti,"Hi, Baljeet!"
2,20,Baljeet,"So after hiding in the bathroom, I jumped out the window and came over here as quickly as possible. I do not even know how to act in front of a girl! I do not even know what girls like."
2,20,Phineas,"Hm. Isn't it like ""sugar and spice, and everything nice""?"
2,20,Baljeet,That is what they are made of. I do not want to build one. Duh!
2,20,Phineas,"Y'know, I think what girls really like is romance."
2,20,Baljeet,Romance?
2,20,Phineas,"Yeah, we learned all about it in this movie we watched last night. Dinner, music, candlelight, and all on a romantic cruise over the ocean blue. Lucky for you, we happen to have a ship right here. Ferb, cancel the giant bottle. I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,20,Carl,"Uh, you're gonna have to pick it up a little, sir. They're starting to boo."
2,20,Major Monogram,"I've gotta hear, Carl. (A machine starts beeping nearby, signaling Perry's arrival) Oh, he's here!"
2,20,Carl,"Well, not really sick, sir, I am a little concerned."
2,20,Major Monogram,(Overlapping him) What did I say about contradicting me in front of the agents?
2,20,Carl,"Sorry, sir."
2,20,Major Monogram,"So, that's pretty much it. You can go, Agent P."
2,20,Major Monogram,"That's it. Okay, Carl. (Sounds of rock band)"
2,20,Baljeet's Mother,Baljeet? Aren't you in the bathroom?
2,20,Baljeet,I climbed out the window.
2,20,Baljeet's Mother,"Oh, I thought it was a..."
2,20,Baljeet,"Mother, please! May I just speak to Mishti?"
2,20,Mishti,"Hey, Baljeet. What's up?"
2,20,Baljeet,(Clears throat) Um... If you do not already have plans for this upcoming afternoon...
2,20,Mishti,"Actually, I had plans with you."
2,20,Baljeet,"Oh, okay! Well, if you are busy..."
2,20,Mishti,"Oh, no, Baljeet! What did you have in mind?"
2,20,Baljeet,"Well, some friends of mine have planned... (pulls out brochure and reads it to her) ""an all-inclusive luxury cruise around Danville Harbor""."
2,20,Mishti,A boat ride? Cool! I will go get my stuff.
2,20,Baljeet,"(Still reading the brochure) ""Highlights of the evening will include a romantic candlelit dinner with-""... oh, she is gone."
2,20,Candace,"I just wish Jeremy was more romantic. You know, like Romeo-and-Juliet romantic, but without all the dying."
2,20,Phineas,"Ahoy, Candace!"
2,20,Candace,"Yeah, Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back. (Pushes another number on speed dial)Hey, Mom."
2,20,Linda,"(Wearing a salad bowl attached to a pipe on her head, an unknown whirring noise emanating from it) Candace, make it quick. I'm in the middle of something."
2,20,Candace,(leaning out her window to see the ship) Phineas and Ferb are leaving on a cruise ship- but I don't even know where they're going!
2,20,Linda,(As the whirring noise gets louder) I can hardly hear you. What's this about a ship? Are you at the harbor?
2,20,Candace,"No, I'm at home! Wait, the harbor! That's where they're going! I'll bust them there."
2,20,Lawrence,"(As he stops blowing into the pipe attached to the salad bowl on Linda's head, revealing him as the source of the whirring noise) Was that Candace on the phone?"
2,20,Linda,Yeah. She probably doesn't know we're in the living room.
2,20,Lawrence,"So, what do you think? (Starts blowing into the pipe again)"
2,20,Linda,"(After a beat) You know, you're right. It does kind of sound like the ocean."
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. You like my scale model? (Gestures to a cardboard model he has made of Danville) I even put my own little building in there, look. Look, there it is! (points at the building) Ah, yes, my home. I can still remember the day I bought it. Flashback!"
2,20,Baljeet,"For your safety, Mishti, I invite you to hold on to the rail. It appears to be very clean, which I know is important to you now that you are a girl."
2,20,Mishti,Huh?
2,20,Phineas,"(Waving) Hey, Isabella. What'cha doooin'?"
2,20,Isabella,The Fireside Girls and I just got our Shrimp Net Repair Patches. What are you doing?
2,20,Phineas,A romantic cruise. You wanna come?
2,20,Isabella,(Gasps in delight) You want me to come on a romantic cruise with you?!
2,20,Phineas,"(oblivious) Yeah, it'll be fun."
2,20,Isabella,(a little nervously) Um...okay.
2,20,(Song,"""Boat of Romance"")"
2,20,Candace,"I knew it! Time to call Mom. (Dials her phone, then tries to yell into it, but a seagull squawks at the same time, scaring her)"
2,20,Linda,(As another unknown whirring noise is occurring in the background) Candace? I can't understand a word you're saying.
2,20,Linda,"Candace, if you're feeding the geese again, I hope you're not wearing a tube top. (Hangs up, then looks at her husband, who is once again the source of the whirring noise) Do you mind?"
2,20,Lawrence,Now it sounds like a spaceship.
2,20,Linda,"Okay, let me try."
2,20,Candace,"Well, they've gotta come back sometime, and when they do, I'll be standing right here ready to bust them. (Three seagulls land on her head and shoulders, imitating her on the lookout. She shakes her arms to shoo them away) Would you get off of me?"
2,20,(Song,"""Boat of Romance"" (instrumental))"
2,20,Isabella,"(romatically) Wow, Phineas! This is so romantic!"
2,20,Phineas,"(oblivious) You think this is romantic? Wait 'til you see what else I have planned. (Isabella blushes, and he takes her hand. He leads her inside the ship.)"
2,20,Isabella,(At the camera) Yes!
2,20,Phineas,Behold: a romantic candlelit dinner for two.
2,20,Isabella,"Oh, Phineas!"
2,20,Phineas,"Ferb, show the happy couple to their table."
2,20,Baljeet,"Here is our table, Mishti. Is this okay with you? It is not too drafty, is it?"
2,20,Mishti,"It will be fine, Baljeet."
2,20,Phineas,Cue music! (At Isabella) Classical music. Very romantic.
2,20,Phineas,Cue rose petals!
2,20,Phineas,Cue...'pid!
2,20,Buford,"Hey, everyone. I'm wearing a diaper."
2,20,Phineas,"(At Isabella, who is obviously not buying it) So...do I know romance, or what?"
2,20,Isabella,(Completely deadpan) What.
2,20,Phineas,"(Oblivious) I said, do I know romance, or --"
2,20,Isabella,I heard you.
2,20,Baljeet,"This food is really good, do you not think so?"
2,20,Mishti,"Uh, yes...I guess so."
2,20,Baljeet,"Subtle, yet pungent."
2,20,Mishti,"Yes, very."
2,20,Buford,"(Still hanging on the rope above the table) Hey, can you pass me one of those bad boys?"
2,20,Mishti,"Uh...look, Baljeet, I appreciate all this, but, uh...I just want to hang out, like we used to."
2,20,Baljeet,"But, uh, are you sure you do not want to hear more music?"
2,20,Buford,"Did somebody say music? (Begins to sing) Ohhh-- (The rope snaps and he falls, crushing the table)"
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"I've attached rockets to the lighthouse, so when I push this button, it will fly to the other side of town, the ships will follow, and then I can finally get some sleep!"
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,Perry the Platypus? How did you escape?
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"(As he bends down) What's that? (Perry punches him in the nose) Ooh! I guess I walked into that one. (He falls backwards, right onto his scale model of Danville, destroying it) Aw, man, I worked all weekend on that!"
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, look, this staple makes a perfect little chimney. I hope Perry the Platypus appreciates all this hard work."
2,20,Vanessa,(As she walks by in the background) He won't.
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,I know!
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"You know what, Perry the Platypus? I think it's time for you to go."
2,20,Doofenshmirtz,"That's right, go on! Your services are no longer required. The lighthouse is gone, and there's nothing you can do about it. So you might as well run back to Major Monogram and tell him you lost this one."
2,20,Baljeet,Did I... Mention how nice the weather is?
2,20,Mishti,(Sighs) Several times.
2,20,Baljeet,Well... It is nice.
2,20,Phineas,"I don't get it. We've tried everything in that romantic movie but nothing seems to work. The orchestra, the petals, the love song. The only other thing they did in that movie is sink the ship."
2,20,Phineas,That ought to do it.
2,20,Baljeet,"I must apologize, the ship sinking was not in the brochure."
2,20,Phineas,Wow. Is this romance or what?
2,20,Isabella,"Phineas, where are the life preservers?"
2,20,Phineas,We don't have any!
2,20,Isabella,What?!
2,20,Phineas,"We've got ""Fun Preservers""! Hit it, Ferb."
2,20,Buford,"Well, that's the end of this diaper."
2,20,Phineas,"Okay, everybody, to the Fun Preservers!"
2,20,Buford,"Oh, oh! Cupids first!"
2,20,(Song,"""Gotta Make Summer Last"")"
2,20,Baljeet,"So you are telling me that even though you are now a girl, you still like to have fun just like in the old days?"
2,20,Mishti,"Of course, Baljeet."
2,20,Baljeet,Then you would not mind if I went like...this? (splashes water on her face)
2,20,Mishti,Not if you do not mind if I go like...this! (shoves him off of the Fun Preserver)
2,20,Phineas,"Hey, this romance stuff was fun. We should do it more often."
2,20,Isabella,"Yes. Yes, we should."
2,20,Phineas,"Hey, there you are, Perry."
2,20,Candace,"All right, you guys better tell me what you were up to on that cruise ship."
2,20,Phineas,"Just whipping up a little romance for Baljeet and his friend, Mishti."
2,20,Candace,You created romance?
2,20,Phineas,Yeah.
2,20,Candace,And...did it work?
2,20,Phineas,Looks like it. They seem to be having a great time.
2,20,Candace,Do you think you could do that for me and Jeremy?
2,20,Phineas,I don't see why not.
2,20,Jeremy,"Candace, I love having some kid's feet in my face as much as the next guy. But how about we just go grab a Slushy Burger?"

2,34,Candace,It's totally time for a totally favorite TV show!
2,34,Candace,"(offering Jeremy a seat) Hey there, Jeremy. Care to have a seat? I have something to show you."

2,34,Candace,"See Jeremy, that's my surprise. They're taping Danville and I already entered us!"
2,34,Stacy,"No, great! You guys are totally gonna win!"
2,34,Jeremy,"Sure, Candace! Um.. I'm gonna go get some fresh air, okay?"
2,34,Candace,Okay!
2,34,Candace,(talking to Stacy) He's so excited to get free!
2,34,Phineas,"So, brother of mine, what ever shall we engage into today? (changes subject of the conversation) Hey Jeremy! What's the hapt of it, guy?"
2,34,Jeremy,"Oh, man. Your sister's into that some big dance show. And, you know, I just don't wanna let her down."
2,34,Phineas,"So, what's the problem?"
2,34,Jeremy,Have you seen the fancy dancing on the show? I can fake it in a school auditorium. Just not in a nationally syndicated dance show.
2,34,Phineas,"Well, maybe Ferb can teach you."

2,34,Jeremy,Wow. That's really-
2,34,Phineas,(interrupting) Uhp-uhp! Wait for it...
2,34,Jeremy,There's no way I can't learn that by tonight.
2,34,Phineas,"Hmmm...maybe you don't have to. (to Ferb) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,34,Phineas,What?
2,34,Phineas,Oh. Sorry. (grabs Ferb's hand and pulls him up) Hey! I wonder where Perry is!
2,34,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Seems Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying the entire Tri-State Area's supply: potatoes, vegan, and whole boatloads of chopped green onions-sounds like a recipe for evil, literally. So, get cooking Agent P! Monogram out."
2,34,Phineas,"So, here it is! The Ferbalistic Groovatron 9000!"
2,34,Jeremy,How is that supposed to help me?
2,34,Phineas,"You put it under your clothes, and nobody will see this electronic exoskeleton helping you with dance moves!"
2,34,Phineas,"Ferb does the fancy dancing move over here, and you do the same fancy dancing move over there!"
2,34,Jeremy,Sweet.
2,34,Computer voice,Intruder alert.
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, well, well, look who's here. Perry the Platypus. All shackled up and no place to go! Um, I think we made too much potato salad, Norm. I guess we'll have to give everyone a 2-ton take-home container. And I still think you should have added more green onions."
2,34,Norm,"Well, next time you'll do all the cooking and I'll stand around coming up with evil plans that ultimately fail!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow. Cuttin' deep, man. Well, I'm off to my annual evil potluck and press conference. I'll just leave you here to, you know, to meet your doom. This, was on the movie. I didn't catch the ending, and other things to do, but it seems really bulletproof. Well, gotta run and y'can't be at two places at one time, so you'll be able to... (turning to Norm) Norm, let's go."
2,34,Norm,Wouldn't it kill you to say please once in a while?
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,You're going to be like this all day.
2,34,Norm,"Yes. Yes, I am."
2,34,Candace,"We are so going to win, this time, Jeremy. We are going TO WIN!"
2,34,Nikki,"Dancers, your dance floor awaits!"
2,34,Nikki,"Our dancers will boogie until they get axed for the judges. If your light goes out, your time is up. Now, let the dancing begin!"
2,34,Phineas,Ready?
2,34,Dr. Bloodpudding,"Alright Heinz, where's the press?"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Patience, Dr. Bloodpudding, they'll be here. When have I ever let you guys down?"
2,34,Rodney,"Far too often Doofenshmirtz, far too often."
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Rodney, I don't remember inviting you."
2,34,Rodney,I told you! I prefer you use my full name: Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth Otto Wolfgang Hypatia Gunther Galen Gary Cooper von Roddenstein!
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Anyway, today is the day we reveal to the Tri-State Area, the existence of the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness!"
2,34,Dr. Bloodpudding,You want us to be called L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.?
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Oh good grief!! It doesn't matter what we're called. What's important is that we get our evil message out to the people of the Tri-State Area!
2,34,Rodney,And how are we going to that with no TV cameras or no press of any kind?
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"They'll be here, they'll be here. Clearly, they buffet along and bring us."
2,34,Norm,"Yummy, yummy potato salad!"
2,34,Rodney,And we do seem to have a surplus of that. (Grins mockingly) Did you expect everyone to lug home 2-ton take home bags?
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,No.
2,34,Norm,(suddenly) Yes.
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Shut it, Norm. Whose side are you on, anyway? And the press will be here, Rodney."
2,34,Dr. Diminutive,"I don't think so, Heinz!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Dr. Diminutive?
2,34,Dr. Diminutive,"Here, look. All the present town is covering this."
2,34,News broadcaster,That's right. Let's Dance 'Til We're Sick is filming here in Danville. And I've got all the live coverage 24/7!
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, if the press won't come to us, we'll go to the press. To the dance hall!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Attention, miserable citizens of Danville!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Hello? Evil scientist speaking! Can you get a hand over here? What? Nothing? Why are they so focused on those dancers?
2,34,Rodney,"Because it's a dance contest, Heinz. Clear, they're only filming the best dancers!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Hm. Wait! That's it! Okay. Split up and dance like you've never danced before! Whoever gets on camera first, they deliver our message of evil!"
2,34,Rodney,"Man, they're terrible!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Ahh! The humanity!!
2,34,Rodney,This looks like a job for Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth-
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, can it, Rodney. I think we both know that I'm a better evil dancer than you."
2,34,Rodney,(Holds up his hand in Doofenshmirtz' face) See this? It's my hand. You can talk to it.
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,All right. Hey hand! My evil dancing's better than yours. It's like you're stuck in a canoe but you've got no oars. See you on the dance floor!
2,34,Rodney,Nobody talks to my hand that way!
2,34,Major Monogram,"(via Perry's wristwatch communicator) Agent P, you must stop Doofenshmirtz and his unnamed gang of evil scientists before they broadcast their message of evil, and interrupt what is going to be my and Carl's favorite show."
2,34,Nikki,"Well, this shindig is in full swing! Looks like judges are starting to eliminate dancers, who will survive?"
2,34,Candace,They're eliminating people. Let's kick it up a notch!
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"People of the Tri-State Area, you may begin pointing in fear about the endless possibilities in miserable convenience of-"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Really? Were you even watching that move?
2,34,Rodney,"(while doing his ballet) Well, my future subjects of desiring Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth-"
2,34,Rodney,This is ful zwein...
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,So I represent the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments-
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,Ah! Philistine! It was a perfectly good Charleston!
2,34,Candace,Oh! You are r-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-a--l-l-l-l-l-y-
2,34,Stacy,"Bravo! Bravo! (tosses a bouquet of flowers) Go, Candace!"
2,34,Random guy,"Oh, that guy is awesome!"
2,34,Nikki,Looks like someone's a fan favorite.
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"This is my spotlight! Who's pushing this dancer out of the way, it's me!"
2,34,Rodney,"Oh no, Doofenshmirtz, I was here first!"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,(Goes face-to-face directly with Rodney) Am I gonna have to talk to your hand again?!?!
2,34,Rodney,Maybe in your own dumb mind!
2,34,Nikki,And look! There's only one dancer left standing! Let's see what he does.
2,34,Nikki,"(while the audience applaud for Jeremy) Say, that was fabulicious dancing out there! I see quite a future for someone with moves like that!"
2,34,Candace,Is she saying what a thing she's saying?
2,34,Nikki,How'd you like to dance 'til you're sick every week?
2,34,Candace,"Do it, Jeremy, do it! We could be stars! Dancing stars! We can-"
2,34,Jeremy,"I can't do this. All those great dance moves I've been doing today, it was actually..."
2,34,Stacy,That's kind of disturbing.
2,34,Jeremy,"It was this crazy contraption doing all these dance moves. If you wanna see what a real dancer looks like, then here you go!"
2,34,Ferb,"Well, looks like my work here is done."
2,34,Jeremy,"But I'm sorry about all this, Candace. I just didn't want to let you down."
2,34,Candace,"Oh, Jeremy. You weren't gonna let me down. I just wanted you to come out with me and have a good time! And you know, dance 'til we're sick!"
2,34,Jeremy,"Well, I am feeling a little dizzy."
2,34,Candace,"I got 'ya, big guy. (They leave the studio)"
2,34,Doofenshmirtz,"(in the intensive care system) They should have called it ""Let's All Dance Until We're In Intensive Care""."
2,34,(Song,"""Spa Day"", instrumental)"
2,34,Jeremy,Wow!
2,22,Vanessa,"Dad, I need a car. I can't keep riding on the back of your scooter every time I go someplace. It's totally embarrassing."
2,22,Biker,"Hey, sweetheart. How'd you like to take a ride on a real bike?"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,She's sixteen!
2,22,Baby alien,"(giggles) Oh, yeah!"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, ever since I installed the Away-inator on my helmet, driving is fun again!"
2,22,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, check this out. (looking at a map) The Super-Duper Megastore is the largest supplier of everything in the Tri-State Area. Heh. I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,22,Candace,"Well, I'm gonna buy Jeremy a gift. It's the anniversary of the very first time Jeremy and I went to Slushy Burger. He spilled a cheese dog on me and mustard got all over the place. He was so sweet."
2,22,Stacy,Hmm. Tough one. I don't think they make a card for that.
2,22,Phineas,"So Mom, what are you gonna get at the store?"
2,22,Linda,I need a 25 pound tub of mayonnaise and 80 pounds of potatoes to make potato salad for the bridge club.
2,22,Phineas,(Puts away his map) Wow. That's a lot of potato salad.
2,22,Linda,(Parks the car) Remember to meet me back at the car in three hours. (Everyone leaves the car)
2,22,Phineas,"Wow, think of it, Ferb. Fifty-two million, six-hundred thirty-seven thousand square acres of unbridled consumerism all under one roof."
2,22,Ferb,(Wolf whistles)
2,22,Phineas,You can whistle that again.
2,22,Ferb,(Wolf whistles)
2,22,Linda,"(While walking him to the Park Your Pooch department on a leash) And you get to go to the pet-sitter's, Perry."
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(takes off his helmet) If you want a car, (Vanessa takes off her helmet) you're going to have to prove to me that you're responsible, that you can do things by yourself."
2,22,Vanessa,How could I do that when I'm always on the back of your scooter?
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(Walks into the superstore) It's a conundrum, isn't it?"
2,22,Major Monogram,"(talking from a screen set into the bone) Psst. Agent P. Agent P. (Perry puts on his fedora) Down here. (Camera zooms into the bone) It's the new dog bone communicator. Pretty clever, huh?"
2,22,Carl,"I thought of it, Agent P."
2,22,Major Monogram,"Carl, I'm trying to use the bone. (to Perry) Anyway, Agent P, we've learned that Dr. Doofenshmirtz is shopping for parts to build another one of his outlandish devices. Put a tail on him."
2,22,Man,You look fabulous!
2,22,Vanessa,So I've got to find some way to prove to you I'm responsible. There must be an easier way to earn a car.
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,You know what they say about taking the easy way.
2,22,Vanessa,What do they say?
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I could tell you, but that would be taking the easy way, and you know what they say about that. Ooh, look! Pizzazium Infinionite!"
2,22,Vanessa,What's that?
2,22,Film Speaker,"You've heard of hydrogen. You may know boron. But of all the elements on the periodic table, none is more fascinating and less abundant than Pizzazium Infinionite. Pizzazium Infinionite was first discovered by fortune hunters fifty years ago in the year 1894. No one is really sure what it does, but look to the future for hover vehicles powered by Pizzazium Infinionite, in the world of tomorrow!"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,See? That's what it is.
2,22,Vanessa,Where did you get the...
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,It's gone! Someone took the last one!
2,22,Baljeet,What luck! Pizzazzium Infinionite! That science prize is as good as mine!
2,22,Buford,So why am I here again?
2,22,Baljeet,"Because, (hands it to Buford to hold) as a person of superior intellect, I require an angry wall of meat to protect my science project."
2,22,Buford,"Angry wall of meat, huh? Yeah, I can do that."
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great. Now I have to scour this whole place and find the Pizzazzium and probably have to wrench it out of the hands of some random shopper."
2,22,Vanessa,"Wait, Dad. I can do this for you. I can go find this--this Pizzazzium thing and prove to you that I can be responsible. That I can do things on my own. Then you can get me my own car, right?"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,I don't know. Are you sure you can...
2,22,Vanessa,Of course I can. I'm me. It'll be a piece of cake.
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,We'll see.
2,22,Vanessa,(sing-song) I'm not hearing a no.
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(sing-song) I'm not saying a yes. (pause) Here, you can take this Pizzazzium locator. It'll help."
2,22,Candace,How am I gonna find that one perfect gift in this humongous store?
2,22,Stacy,"Hey, isn't Jeremy into camping?"
2,22,Candace,Yeah.
2,22,Stacy,"So maybe a pocket knife, or a fishing lure,...or a compound bow. (imitates someone shooting an arrow) Take that, apple on kid's head!"
2,22,Candace,(gasps) He said he needed a lantern!
2,22,Stacy,"Yeah, a lantern's good."
2,22,Baljeet,And then I will start my own foundation to... Are you not hearing me?
2,22,Buford,What? Buford hungry. (accidentally drops tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite over balcony)
2,22,Baljeet,I really have to rethink having you as my wall of meat.
2,22,Candace,Too big.
2,22,Stacy,Too small.
2,22,Candace,"Oh, I don't want to get him just any old lantern."
2,22,Stacy,You can't expect the perfect gift to just drop out of the sky.
2,22,Candace,But... (holds hands out in expression and the tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite lands in them)
2,22,Stacy,Woah.
2,22,Candace,It's perfect! It's all futuristic-y and cool...and it dropped out of the sky!
2,22,Stacy,"Well, I guess I stand corrected."
2,22,Candace,"When Jeremy looks into its bright glow, he'll think of me...(Candace and Stacy notice the switch) Hey, what's this?"
2,22,Both,Ahh!
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey buddy, watch where you're... Say, you look fabulous. (a brief clip of ""Fabulous"" plays) Haven't I seen you somewhere before? (Perry chatters then flees the scene) No need to get huffy, you ran into me!"
2,22,Phineas,"Ahhh. You know Ferb, I think I know what I want to do every day."
2,22,Vanessa,"(beeping gets more rapid, and she notices the tube of Pizzazzium Infinionite on the ground) Well, that was easy."
2,22,Baljeet,"...I gotta get it, gotta g... gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it..."
2,22,Baljeet,"Yes! Mine, mine mine mine mine mine mine!"
2,22,Vanessa,"Wha- hey! Watch where you're... Oh great, now this thing is broken, and they've got the Pizzazziu... (sighs) Look, (to Ferb) thanks for your help, but I can do this on my own, okay? (runs away with Pizzazzium locator)"
2,22,Candace,(sighs) That lantern was the perfect gift.
2,22,Baljeet,Woo-hoo!
2,22,Candace,Buford and Baljeet! How did they get it?
2,22,(Song,"""I'm Me"")"
2,22,Vanessa,"♪ I can do it, I can run, I can hunt you down ♪"
2,22,Phineas,"Ferb, you've gotta try this chair! I can't feel my brain!"
2,22,Vanessa,"(searching through the ball pit) Ugh, I hope nobody sees me in here."
2,22,Linda,"Ferb, honey, aren't you a little old to be playing in the ball pit?"
2,22,Ferb,"Yes, yes I am."
2,22,Linda,Okay then. (walks away; Vanessa emerges from under the balls)
2,22,Vanessa,Your name is Ferb?
2,22,Ferb,"Well yes, it's short for... (the vacuum pulls up the Pizzazium) Oh, here it is."
2,22,Vanessa,"(grabs Pizzazium and runs out of the pit) Thanks, Ferb! See you around!"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(walking up to a lawn mower with a sign above it) Push button, start mower. Does this really work?"
2,22,Baljeet,I will take that!
2,22,Phineas,"Ferb, my fingers look just like snakes!"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"(at a ""Mystic Eye"" table) Oh, it's one of those 3D things. (holds up the picture) I can hardly see the... (Perry crashes through the picture, dropping the Pizzazium) Oop, there it is."
2,22,Vanessa,Ferb!
2,22,Stacy,Check it out! They do make a card for a spilled cheese dog with mustard.
2,22,Vanessa,"Well, Ferb. You certainly know how to show a girl a good time! (holds up the Pizzazium) I've gotta get this to my dad immediately. (Ferb throws the Pizzazium into the tennis ball launcher, which fires) Whoa! (the Pizzazium bounces and rolls past Doofenshmirtz, in line at the checkout counter, to the entrance of the store; Doofenshmirtz gleefully picks it up) Well, that worked."
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"I got it! I got it! (Perry moves the alarm sensor at the entrance, causing the security alarm to go off) I got it! (two security guards show up)"
2,22,Security guard,"Excuse me sir, you know you have to pay for this. (takes the Pizzazium)"
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,I was! I was going to pay!
2,22,Security guard,Tell it to the judge.
2,22,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't worry, guys, we'll- we'll get this all straightened out. Va- Vanessa! Vanessa... (the guards drag him away) No no, you can't take me, I don't have anyone to curse!"
2,22,Candace,"Whoa, Mom. Do you think you found everything you need?"
2,22,Linda,I think I have enough to tide over the bridge club.
2,22,Stacy,That's a lot of potato salad.
2,22,Vanessa,"Well, time to find out where they dragged Dad off to. Guess that car will have to wait. Oh, yeah. Thanks. (kisses Ferb on the cheek and leaves; the floral background and music start up again)"
2,22,Phineas,"(appears next to Ferb, shaking) Did I miss something? (Ferb touches Phineas' nose, making him stop shaking) Thanks, Ferb."
2,36,Candace,"Ahh, a nice relaxing day at the beach. Nothing but the waves, the sun and peace and quiet..."
2,36,Baljeet,Buford drank all the sunscreen!
2,36,Buford,Coconut is my favorite flavor!
2,36,Isabella,Who wants to play volleyball?
2,36,Candace,I spoke too soon.
2,36,Linda,"Oh, Candace, look, there is a sandcastle building contest over there. You used to love those. You should sign up!"
2,36,Candace,"Yeah! Wait... (mutter) Why brother? With these two here, there will be no competition. They'll build a real skyscraper out of sand, with a working elevator, and window-washers, and a parking garage with flying cars! They'll totally steal my thunder!"
2,36,Phineas,"Actually, there are something else we may be doing today. With a minimal amount of research, Ferb found out that the lost city of Atlantis is probably located right off the coast of Danville!"
2,36,Isabella,Ooh! I hope I will see a real life seahorse! And get my Underwater Equestrian Patch!
2,36,Buford,I'd like to see a shark! I heard that those are the toughest fish in the ocean.
2,36,Irving,I got in the car when your mom stopped for gas. I'm just happy to be here.
2,36,Buford,Wow...
2,36,Irving,"Ooh, and I bought my camera, to take pictures of all the action!"
2,36,Phineas,"Guess we know what we're doing today. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,36,Male singer,"♪ Doo wa doo be doo wa doo be doo be doo wa.♪ Thank you, thank you very much."
2,36,Carl,"(Imitating Major Monogram) Ahh, Agent P! Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been to every plant-nursery in town, buying up little seedlings and now he's out with he's blimp. Find out what he's up to!"
2,36,Major Monogram,Carl?
2,36,Carl,Ohh... eheheh... sir?
2,36,Major Monogram,Are those my old mustache clippings?
2,36,Carl,Some of them?
2,36,Major Monogram,"Sorry you had to see that, Agent P. Please find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to!"
2,36,Phineas,"Hey, Mom! We're gonna go find the lost city of Atlantis! Be back later!"
2,36,Linda,What some imaginations...
2,36,Candace,"Mom! Oooh! They're leaving! Mom, get out the turret molds. We've got a sandcastle to build!"
2,36,Phineas,"Okay everybody, follow me! And remember, if you get lost, the surface is up!"
2,36,Irving,Wow! Is that the Titanic over there?
2,36,Isabella,Look! It's Amelia Earhart!
2,36,Baljeet,"Ah, the tomb of Poseidon."
2,36,Phineas,"Focus, guys. We're looking for Atlantis, remember? (to Ferb) Which way, Ferb?"
2,36,GPS,Take phytoplankton road north.
2,36,Irving,Hold it! (He takes a picture) That one's for my wallet!
2,36,Baljeet,Why is water always so warm next to you?
2,36,Linda,I'm so glad that you wanted to join the contest. This'll be fun!
2,36,Candace,"If we're going to do this, we gonna do it right! Here, fill these buckets with water, I'm going to go find some sand."
2,36,Doofenshmirtz,"(Spraying the plants in his blimp) Lunchtime, my little plant friends! Yes, you like your water, don't you! Everyone gets H2O, even you little... Oh, Perry the Platypus! You landed into my fertilizer trap! Look at you. You've potting soiled yourself! (He laughs) So, I got to thinking, why use animals or insects to aid in my evil scheme, when there are these shiftless do-nothing-plants just laying around? So, I've created a super evil growth formula, that when sprayed on my plants, that will turn them into thorny, prickly minions! With them under my control, I will rule the Tri-State Area with an iron fist, and a green thumb! Hahahaha... (He sniffs) And, if you don't mind, I'm going upwind of you."
2,36,Phineas,"We're almost there, guys!"
2,36,GPS,Turn right at kelp.
2,36,Irving,These sculls are pretty cool! (An eel takes Irving's camera) Hey!
2,36,Phineas,"It's okay, Irving, you still have the greatest camera ever made."
2,36,Irving,Where?
2,36,Phineas,"Right here, the human mind. You can take pictures with your mind and store them in your memory. Try it!"
2,36,Irving,"Okay... Click! Well, I guess that worked..."
2,36,Isabella,Seahorses!
2,36,Baljeet,You can get your Underwater Equestrian Patch now!
2,36,Isabella,Umm... that was a joke. They're way to small to ride...
2,36,Buford,"Not if you scoop up a whole bunch of them! (He scoops up school of seahorses, and rides seahorses) Giddy up!"
2,36,Phineas,"Hey, guys. Look what I found! A door with ancient runes telling us how to open it!"
2,36,Buford,"Forget that! Step aside! (He punches the door, revealing Atlantis)"
2,36,Phineas,Or that.

2,36,Irving,Say cheese! Click!
2,36,Baljeet,We are so privileged to be in this strange and beautiful place. To think that the greatest mind in history have been searching for Atlantis for thousands of years.
2,36,Buford,Those guys are punks.
2,36,Phineas,We should bring this up to the surface for the whole world to see!
2,36,Baljeet,"Oh, yes. That is a great idea."

2,36,Buford,Up! Up!

2,36,Girl,"(Standing next to her sandcastle) Oh man, this is super simple!"
2,36,Candace,"Argh, I hate this stupid contest. I quit!"
2,36,Linda,"Hon, will you relax? This is supposed to be fun."
2,36,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace! Hey, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher!"
2,36,Candace,Jeremy?! Hi! (She stutters) What brings you to the magnificent shores of Danville?
2,36,Jeremy,"Well, I'm the judge of the contest this year."
2,36,Candace,No way!
2,36,Jeremy,"Way! I'm excited to see what you two come up with! But you better get started, time's tickin'!"
2,36,Candace,Mom? Why are you just standing there? Sand castles don't build themselves. Chop chop!
2,36,Doofenshmirtz,"You see, Perry the Platypus? Your efforts to try to stop me have been fruitless. Fruitless. Y-you like that one? Yeah, that's a good one! Fruitless? Next time you'll ""leaf"" me alone! Heh heh heh. Yes, Perry teh Platypus, I can be a fun guy. Get it? Fungi? The plural of fungus? Heheh... it's a... Yeah... Anyway, grow my green minions and get him! (He turns on a machine, and sprays the plants, making them thorny, carnivorous, and sentient) Wait, wait not me, not me... Hey, wait, don't be, don't be grab... I gotta turn this off... this has become a thorny situation..."
2,36,Delivery Man,"Four weather balloons and helium canisters, for underwater delivery..."

2,36,Deliver Man,"Well, good for you."
2,36,Phineas,"Alright guys, let's get to work!"
2,36,Candace,"Oh no, Jeremy is almost here!"
2,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Help, Perry the Platypus, help! (The plants squeeze Perry out of his trap) Yes, yes, Perry, you got it! That's it, you're free now, and move over here... wait! Where are you going? Perry the Platyp... (Doofenshmirtz gets slapped by a vine)"
2,36,Phineas,"Okay guys, tie the balloons to the four corners of Atlantis. Looks good, Ferb!"
2,36,All,Wohooo! It's working!
2,36,Jeremy,"(Judging a sandcastle) Lookin' good, guys!"
2,36,Candace,(To Linda) Looks kinda...
2,36,Linda,...cool!
2,36,Candace,"(A piece of their sandcastle falls off) This is horrible! Jeremy's gonna take one look at this, and think that I'm a big losery loser!"
2,36,Linda,"Oh, honey, Jeremy's smart enough to separate your sandcastle from his feelings about you!"
2,36,Jeremy,"Okay, now last, but not least, we have the Flynn-Fletchers..."
2,36,Candace,"Well, it's not perfect but... we had fun doing it, so, I give you, our sandcastle."
2,36,Jeremy,"(looking up, and seeing Atlantis) Holy Moly, Candace!"
2,36,Candace,"I know, I know, it's not great, but we did our best."
2,36,Jeremy,"Are you kidding? It's amazing! You win, you win! I'm gaining to get your blue ribbon."
2,36,Candace,Huh?
2,36,Doofenshmirtz,(A vine chomps down on Doofenshmirtz's nose) AHH!
2,36,Linda,"I have to say, I think Jeremy can't separate his feelings for you from his feelings for this sand castle. He must like you more than you thought..."
2,36,Candace,Hehe. I know! Let's go get that blue ribbon!
2,36,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, you came back and saved me! Thank you, Perry the Platy... (He begins to breakout) Hey... wha... what's this? I'm having an allergic reaction to these stupid plants! Curse you, inadequate immune system!"
2,36,Baljeet,What happened?
2,36,Isabella,Did anybody see it?
2,36,Buford,Why did it go back down?
2,36,Ferb,Perhaps the lost city of Atlantis wanted to stay lost.
2,36,Irving,"At least I got the pictures in my head. Hey! I had my thumb in front of the lens the whole time! Oh, now all I remember is my thumb!"
2,5,Phineas,"There's our new pet Goldie. I wonder if we're as cute to her as she is to us? (Pause) Yeah, yeah we are. What can we do for Goldie since she's already done so much for us?"
2,5,Phineas,"A marine-life aquarium? Great idea, Ferb! Let's build a best ever of one of these and give Goldie that special home she deserves. Does that sound good to you, Perry?"
2,5,Phineas,"(At Goldie) So it's unanimous. Hey, where's Candace?"
2,5,Linda,Candace? Where are you? (Notices Candace) What are you doing?
2,5,Candace,"Waiting for Jeremy to call! You see, last night, at the movies, he said was going to call soon. So I calculated that ""soon"" must mean first thing in the morning since ""soon"" can't refer to a period in excess of or equal to 24 hours, give or take a 59 minute cushion of time, on either side of the event in question. (Candace holds up a notepad of her math) See? I had it all figured out right here on this notepad. I even showed my math!"
2,5,Linda,Uh...
2,5,Candace,Wait! Maybe I should have carried the one instead of dividing by Jeremy's face...
2,5,Linda,"Well, I'm off to my favorite author's book signing. Try not to freak out on your brothers while I'm gone."
2,5,Candace,"Mom! I don't frea—Oh my gosh! The square root of ""soon"" is ""never""!"
2,5,Phineas,"I got the filter done, how's the water coming?"
2,5,Ferb,(Thumbs up)
2,5,Woman,Herman! Are you taking a shower?
2,5,Herman,No.
2,5,Woman,"(Pause) Well, you need one!"
2,5,Phineas,"There you go, Goldie! Your new home! It's huge, it's amazing... it's lonely. We need to get her some new friends."
2,5,Boat captain,"Say, aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel?"
2,5,Phineas,"Why, yes. Yes we are."
2,5,Boat captain,Alright then.
2,5,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,5,Major Monogram,"Oh, Agent P, uh, pardon the newspapers, but, uh, we have a lot of new young recruits coming through here today, and, well, they aren't, uh, trained yet. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased the entire Tri-State Area's supply of bratwurst. Get to the bottom of it. Oh, and, uh, watch your step on the way out."
2,5,Phineas,"Goldie, how do you like your new friends?"
2,5,Phineas,NOOOOOOOOO!
2,5,Phineas,"That was cool enough to be in one of those trained marine animal shows. Hmm...Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today."
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,(singsong) Yoo-hoo! Perry the Platypus!
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"Say hello to the Platypus Secret Agent Arrival In Order To Foil My Evil Plot Capture-inator! Or as I like to call it: my P.S.A.A.I.O.T.F.M.E.P.C.-inator. I made it up myself. Enough chit-chat! Let me tell you my latest evil scheme. You see, back before I was evil, I was something a little less than evil. I was a bratwurst street vendor."
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"What? They have those. See? Nobody remembers them. You know why? Because of the hot dog vendors! Oh, how I hated them! They had it all! They had chrome-plated carts and endorsement deals and fancy blimps! And what did we have? Only superior workmanship, finer meats, and exotic spices."
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,(voiceover) I was sure that it was just a matter of time before the public would recognize our superior quality.
2,5,Kid 1,How do you know when you're really lame?
2,5,Kid 2,When you sell bratwurst! (kids laugh)
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Then and there, I swore..."
2,5,Doofenshmirtz (cont'd),"(walking up to a tarp) I would get my revenge. (uncovering the tarp) Behold, the Hot-Dog-Vendor-Revenge-inator! Or my H.D.V.R.....ina...I...I have to work on my acronyms. Here's how it works. (presses a remote button lowering a screen showing a slideshow) The Revenge-inator sets off a freon blast to an unsuspecting hot dog vendor encasing their hot water boilers in a sheet of ice and rendering their hot dogs cold and soggy. (He presses the remote again ending the slideshow and raising the screen back up) And once I've taken the hot out of the dog, they'll be forced to sell my bratwursts instead! (Perry rolls his eyes.) Don't roll your eyes at me! It's a good plan! (huffs and crosses his arms) Sorry to go off on you like that, Perry the Platypus, but sometimes you just, oh, really push my buttons!"
2,5,Candace,"Oh, I can't take anymore! I'm just gonna call him!"
2,5,(Song,When Will He Call Me?)
2,5,Candace,"(looking out the window) Hey, what's with all these kids?"
2,5,Candace,"That's what I thought! Phineas and Ferb! I've so got them this time! (She snaps a photo with her phone, but looks at it to see a lot of fists in the air.) I can't send that to Mom! 'Scuse me! Comin' through! One side!"
2,5,Man,Hey! No cuttin' in line!
2,5,Candace,It's my backyard! I outrank you!
2,5,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Goldie's Aqueous Extravaganza."
2,5,Candace,Uh-oh! Yaaaahh! (She lands in the aquarium.)
2,5,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, our sister, Candace!"
2,5,Candace,Phineas! Ablblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl...
2,5,Phineas,"That's the spirit, Candace! Everybody!"
2,5,All,(wagging their tongues) Ablblblblblblblblblblblblblblbl...
2,5,Candace,MAKE THIS FISH PUT ME DOWN!!!
2,5,Phineas,"It's a mammal, Candace!"
2,5,Candace,Meap.
2,5,Phineas,"Way to go, Candace!"
2,5,Candace,How did I get in this fish show?!?!
2,5,Phineas,Mammal.
2,5,Candace,Whatever!
2,5,Phineas,"Wow! You're a natural, Candace!"
2,5,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
2,5,Phineas,"Hey, look at that! (an octopus swims by) Ferb, where did the octopus come from?"
2,5,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
2,5,Candace,Must...take...picture! (She snaps a pic.) Send!
2,5,Linda,"I've gotta tell you, I read your first book and I love it."
2,5,Bridgette Oshinomi,Do you have a high-strung teen at home?
2,5,Linda,"Uh, you could say that. (her phone beeps) Ooh, this must be her."
2,5,Bridgette Oshinomi,She sent you a picture? Lemme see.
2,5,Linda,Well...okay.
2,5,Bridgette Oshinomi,"How bad can it be? After all, I've been through with own— (She sees the picture of Candace freaking out) Oh. (gives the phone back to Linda) I think that you need the rest of the set. (gives two books) Uh, and why don't you take a whack at that first book again?"
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"And now, Perry the Platypus, (activating his inator) it is time for revenge! Goodbye, hot dog street ven— (Perry pushes Doof to the ground.) Oh, what the?! How did you get out of my trap? (Cut to reveal a wooden Perry in the trap with a tag saying ""DECOY"" on it.) A decoy? That doesn't even make any sense! But, okay, I surrender, I'm a reasonable man. (reaching around) I know when it's time to (grabs a bratwurst and whacks Perry with it) fight back! Waa-ha! (Perry wipes away the grease on his fur, takes off his fedora, and produces a hot dog from out of it.) Woo-ho-ho. Your hot dog is no match for my bratwurst!"
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, no, just kidding! I—But I made you look, didn't I? Huh? Huh?"
2,5,Candace,"Wait a minute, is that Jeremy? What's he doing here? (Gets slapped by an orca tail.)"
2,5,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace, did you get my messages?"
2,5,Candace,"Messages? (Gets slapped by another orca tail and looks at her phone, while riding the dolphin.) Eleven messages? (Rides the dolphin, which goes through a hoop held up by Ferb.) He called me!"
2,5,Jeremy,"Go, Candace!"
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"Not so hotsy-totsy now! Are you, Perry the Platypus?"
2,5,Computer,Fire.
2,5,Candace,He called me! I can't believe he really called me!
2,5,Candace,"What happened to all the fish? (slips on the ice) Aaaaaaaahhh!!! (She falls and gets caught by Jeremy.) Oh, my!"
2,5,Jeremy,Wow! You were great back there!
2,5,Candace,Thanks!
2,5,Phineas,"Great show, Ferb! I don't remember freezing the tank being part of the finale, but that rocked! Looks like it didn't freeze all the way through. Nice."
2,5,Doofenshmirtz,"Eh, so what? Big deal. So it missed it's initial target. A minor setback. (Perry puts his finger on one of the bratwursts in the pile.) No wait! You'll disrupt the pile's equilibrium! (Perry takes the bratwurst out, nothing happens.) Well, hot diggity do— (All the bratwursts fall onto Doofenshmirtz and crash through the building and go down the streets.) Curse you, Perry the Platypus!!"
2,5,Jeremy,I've been trying to call all day.
2,5,Candace,Uh... hehehehehehehehehehehe...
2,5,Jeremy,(puts her down) Do you wanna go do something?
2,5,Candace,"Omigosh, yes! (She bends down, and her butt somehow causes the ice block to move, taking the stadium seats with it. Linda's station wagon parks.)"
2,5,Jeremy,"Really, you didn't even look at your messages?"
2,5,Candace,"Yeah, I know."
2,5,Jeremy,"That's okay, Candace. You looked like you were pretty busy."
2,5,Candace,Mom!
2,5,Jeremy,"Hi, Mrs. Flynn."
2,5,Linda,"Hi, Jeremy."
2,5,Candace,You have to come to the backyard! (Pushes Linda into the backyard) Phineas and Ferb built a whole aquarium with whales and everything!
2,5,Jeremy,I'll call ya in a little while.
2,5,Candace,You'll see! (Closes eyes) Tada!!
2,5,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
2,5,Linda,"Look, honey! I brought ya a book."
2,5,Candace,Did Jeremy just say he'll call me in a little while? (gets out her phone and dials) How long is that supposed to be?!
2,5,Phineas,"Well, I guess Goldie and her friends are headed to the ocean."
2,5,Ferb,"Well, you know what they say, if you love something, set it free."
2,5,Phineas,"Yeah, we do that every day with Perry. (Perry, also up in the tree, chatters.) Oh, there you are, Perry, we were just talkin' about you."
2,5,Woman,Are you takin' a shower now?
2,5,Herman,"(offscreen, obnoxiously) Yes."
2,4,(Song,Flawless Girl)
2,4,Announcer,Flawless Girl. Because nobody's perfect without using our cosmetics.
2,4,Candace,(Scoffs) I'd be so lost without Flawless Girl giving me some pointers on how to look.
2,4,Stacy,"Hey, look! (Flips the magazine) It says here that Flawless Girl founder, Blanca Dishon, will be at the Mid-Summer's Festival in search of the next Flawless Girl spokes-model."
2,4,Candace,"Maybe I should sign up. (Laughs) Just out of curiosity, when is the Mid-Summer's Festival?"
2,4,Stacy,Probably in the middle of summer...which is about now!
2,4,Phineas,"Oh, what do you know, it must be the middle of summer. (Beeping sound) It's the Baljeet Signal!"
2,4,Baljeet,"Phineas and Ferb, days ago, you helped me build a portal to Mars. Now, I beg you to help me win the Biggest Watermelon Contest at the festival. Help me, Phineas and Ferb. You're my only hope! (Looks around and then shuts off his hologram)"
2,4,Phineas,"Ferb, grab that Jr. Chemistry Set you got for Bastille Day. We're going to the festival. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,4,Major Monogram,"Oh, for crying out loud! Who put a secret entrance at the bottom of the neighbors' koi pond? Okay, look-look-look. To avoid a lawsuit, give the fish hats, and we'll make them agents, and uh... Ooh, right! Agent P, your mission. Um you, know, Doofenshmirtz! Go!"
2,4,Phineas,"Hey Baljeet, where's your watermelon?"
2,4,Baljeet,"Yeah, look at it! (Reveals a small watermelon) It mocks me, bringing shame to my family."
2,4,Phineas,"Ferb, time for a little chemistry. (Ferb walks over to an empty spot, opens his Jr. Chemistry Set and reveals a large chemistry work area)"
2,4,Baljeet,Hmm. Could I borrow Ferb sometime?
2,4,Candace,Flawless Girl booth...where is it?
2,4,P. P. Otter,"Hey you, girl! Don't you ever look in the mirror and end up feeling bad about yourself?"
2,4,Candace,Well...
2,4,P. P. Otter,"For just five dollars, you can feel good about yourself for no time!"
2,4,Candace,"Oh, I don't need that. I've got Flawless Girl cosmetics to make me feel good. (Walks through the festival and sees Phineas and Ferb, who are using the chemistry set)"
2,4,Phineas,"...And bada bing bada boom, you've got your miracle growth elixir."
2,4,Candace,What are you guys up to?
2,4,Phineas,Hey Candace! We're gonna help Baljeet with the Biggest Watermelon Contest.
2,4,Candace,"(Pointing to the watermelon) What's that, a cantaloupe?"
2,4,Baljeet,(Giving himself a facepalm) Aww!
2,4,Phineas,"Not for long. (Puts a drop of the growth elixir on the watermelon, and it hardly grows larger)"
2,4,Candace,(Laughs) It worked! Your miracle growth elixir has turned you into giant nerds! (Walks away)
2,4,Baljeet,I will call my family and tell them to start putting up the shame curtains.
2,4,Phineas,No way! It hasn't taken full effect yet. You'll see.
2,4,Baljeet,"Not through the shame curtains, I won't."
2,4,Blanca,Next!
2,4,Candace,You're Blanca Dishon! I'm Candace. I'm here to become your next Flawless Girl.
2,4,Blanca,"Stand over by that sign, please. (Candace walks over to the sign and is too short) Hmm. Aren't you a little short to be the next Flawless Girl?"
2,4,Candace,Uh...
2,4,Blanca,Yes. Yes you are.
2,4,Candace,But I'm five-foot-eight!
2,4,Blanca,"(Sigh) Look, it's right in our song. ""At the forefront of every trend. Never less than five-foot-ten."""
2,4,Candace,I thought you were just looking for a rhyme.
2,4,Blanca,Nobody is perfect. But you can come close by buying our full line of Flawless Girl skin care products. Next!
2,4,Candace,"(Sobs to Mom via phone) So I can never be perfect! No matter what I do, I'll always be two inches too ugly! I need a sudden growth spurt in the next fifteen minutes."
2,4,Linda,"Oh, honey, it's not bad."

2,4,Candace,I'm in! Auditions start in two hours! (giggles)
2,4,Stacy,"Hey, is there something different about you?"
2,4,Candace,"Who knows? Maybe I've grown out of my awkward phase. (Suddenly, her nose begins to grow)"

2,4,Candace,Someone's coming! (she sticks her head back into the tent)
2,4,P.P. Otter,"Hello, boys. The name's P.P. Otter. I run the Oddball Show. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend in the tent?"
2,4,Phineas,"Oh, that's our sister. Our... (stifles laughter) big sister. (both Phineas and Ferb try to hold their laughter in while Candace growls) Okay, sorry. Candace, this is P.P. (Ferb giggles)"
2,4,Candace,"Yeah, we've met."

Uh, take five, guys. Not you, Perry the Platypus, if I can just have a word with you. (Perry walks into the engineer's station, where he immediately gets trapped) Ha ha ha! (the trapping device raises up to reveal Perry trapped in a baby carrier) It's a cute little trap, isn't it? I got the idea at my cousin Gertrude's baby shower. (Perry gives him a look) Don't judge me, men go to baby showers these days! It was fun. Presents, blindfolded diapering... I'm sorry, I-I'm off-topic, aren't I? It's this darn midsummer's festival! With the laughing and the music and the constant ringing on my bell to use the bathroom! (toilet flushes in the background) Well, I'm going to put an end it once and for all! You see, I have created a device to cover the entire midsummer's festival with the worst smell in the history of mankind! Dirty diapers! (Perry looks in terror) And, yeah, I got all that from a baby shower. How do you like me now, Perry the Judgapus?"
2,4,Candace,Can't you you just make up some kind of reducing cream? Or an amazing shrink ray device?

2,4,P.P. Otter,All day!
2,4,Doofenshmirtz,"So, Perry the Platypus, (Candace is seen out the window climbing up) I found a way to distill the smell of dirty diapers into a concentrated liquid form, (He shows Perry a beaker filled with blue liquid.) which I will spread throughout the festival using my Smellinator!"

(to Otter) You show people oddballs so they'll feel better about themselves, (to Blanca) and you make beauty totally unobtainable so they'll feel worse about themselves! Look at me! I'm fifty feet tall now and it's still out of reach! Well, I've had it! Making beauty the focus of my life has distracted me from the real focus of my life: Busting my brothers. Giant Candace is out, PEACE! (She jumps off the building and lands on the ground with a thud)"

I just snap it into place and set the range for, say, 200 yards around the building. (Perry struggles to get out of his trap) Hear that, Perry the Platypus? That is the sound of smell! Nothing can stop me now! (Some water pouring on him contradicts his statement. When the water stops, it is revealed that some aquatic agents have arrived.

2,37,Linda,(sarcastically) Oh no. How will you manage?

2,37,Linda,I thought you already got a gift for Jeremy.
2,37,Candace,"I did, but I can't show up with an obvious, stupid present that anyone could've gotten him.

2,37,Phineas,"Santa's not just for little kids, Candace."
2,37,Candace,"Okay, fine. Let's assume there is a Santa Claus."
2,37,Phineas,"Well of course there is. There's been a ton of reported sightings. Oregon, 1978. Northern Scotland, 1954. The so-called Santa Cloth found in Istanbul, 1912."
2,37,Phineas,"Santa's one of our biggest heroes. Talk about making the most out of one day. Imagine flying around the whole world, delivering toys and gifts to everybody in one night. Ferb and I have done some cool stuff in our time, but that, that's something else."
2,37,Candace,"Again, let's assume there is a Santa Claus. He's got it easy. The hard part is trying to figure out what to get people want when they don't write you a letter, telling you exactly what they want most. And by ""people"" I mean ""Jeremy"", and by ""you"", I mean ""me""... and uh, no the rest is pretty much literal."
2,37,Phineas,Well I'm sure Jeremy would get exactly what he wanted. If he wrote his own letter to Santa.
2,37,Candace,"Bwahahaha, letters to Santa!? (Laughs) That's for little kids. (Laughs)"
2,37,Phineas,Wow. She's lapped us.
2,37,Candace,"Wait that's it! I'll trick Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa, so I can sneak a peek and learn what he wants straight from the horse's mouth. And by ""mouth"" I mean ""pen"", and by ""horse"" I mean Jeremy, and... yeah we're good."
2,37,Phineas,Or you could ask him directly what he wants to avoid any unnecessary complications.
2,37,Candace,You are such a child sometimes. (She leaves the boys' room)

2,37,Buford,Maybe.
2,37,Baljeet,Are you not going ask me what my Christmas wish is?

2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, Planty the Potted Plant, since you're just hanging around.... (chuckles) Let me demonstrate the brilliant evil-losity of my latest inven..."
2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Grr. You see? See, that's what I'm talking about. Ever since those condos next door started"
2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Thank you! Thank you for my point for me! (to Planty) Now, I'll cover it with an irresistible gravy coating, and then it will take off and soar through town, getting all the dogs to chase after it until they follow it right off the edge of the Tri-State area! (smiles smugly) Well, Planty the Potted Plant. Pretty clever, eh? (pauses, then pushes Planty away) Don't give me that look. Prepare to launch..."
2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, how did you do that? (Gets hit on back of his head again) Ow! Ow! Come out in the open where I can... Ow!"
2,23,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
2,23,Phineas,"Stomp harder, Ferb! This carrot juice is gotta be really concentrated."
2,23,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
2,23,Phineas,Just waiting for the concentrated carrot extract to mix with the super heated optical polymers. Now I dip the frames to the x-ray solution. It may take a couple of hours to set properly.
2,23,Isabella,Or just five minutes in my Quick-E-Bake Oven. Fireside Girls are always prepared. (Places x-ray glasses in the Quick-E-Bake Oven)
2,23,Isabella,(Taps the x-ray glasses) Looks like they're ready. (Hands them to Phineas)
2,23,Phineas,Here goes nothing.
2,23,Isabella,"Hey, it sounds like it's coming from my house."
2,23,Isabella,"Mom, what's wrong?"
2,23,Vivian,I lost my wedding ring!
2,23,Isabella,"Okay, Mom, when did you have been doing since you last saw it?"
2,23,Vivian,"Ah, si, si, si. I was fixing some lunch, then I washed the dishes."
2,23,Phineas,"(Raises an eyebrow) Dishes, huh? It looks like a job for x-ray vision glasses. (Blinks, then finds Vivian's wedding ring stuck in the drainpipe) I found it!"
2,23,Vivian,"Ah, thank you, Phineas. Uh...where is it?"
2,23,Phineas,"Down in the drainpipe under the sink. (Moves left curtain) We'll have it out for you in a jiff. (to Ferb) Quick, Ferb! We need a 14-inch pipe wrench, a blowtorch, and a jar of mayonnaise."
2,23,Vivian,"Ooh, that's very sweet of you boys, but I think I'll call my regular plumber. He's bonded."
2,23,Phineas,"(Takes off x-ray glasses) Okay, suit yourself."
2,23,Isabella,The glasses work great!
2,23,Phineas,(Puts the glasses back on) This is gonna be fun.
2,23,(Song,X-Ray Eyes)
2,23,Phineas,Looks our x-ray vision glasses have passed all the quality control tests.
2,23,Isabella,"Good thing, because we're stocking up quite a pile of orders."
2,23,Phineas,Excellent. It's time to order a big truck load of carrots.
2,23,Candace,Mr. Cutie-Patootie?! Where are you?! MR. CUTIE PATOOTIE!!!
2,23,Female Voice,Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
2,23,Major Monogram,"Uh, hello, Agent... (Gasps) No! Not you! Agent P, you've got to stop him before he..."
2,23,Female Voice,Access granted.
2,23,Phineas,"(While talking on the phone) Yes, ma'am, you heard me right. I need three metric tons of your highest grade carrots delivered A.S.A.P. (Person on the other end answers) Why yes, yes I am."
2,23,Candace,Have you seen Mr. Cutie-Patootie? I can't find him anywhere.
2,23,Phineas,"Well, did you check the backyard? He might be there."
2,23,Phineas,Hmm. How about the kitchen?
2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"(Sighs wearily) Well, Planty the Potted Plant. You have proven yourself quite the adversary. Why don't we just...call this one a draw? (Plops himself against the door) I'm kind of pooped."
2,23,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah! Curse you, Planty the Potted Plant!"
2,23,Major Monogram,"Good work, Agent P. (Gives a thumbs up)"
2,23,Candace,You don't suppose he could've run away?
2,23,Phineas,"Don't worry. I'm sure he'll turn up. (Notices that all the carrots have disappeared) Hey, what happened to all the carrots? One minute there's a backyard full of carrots. I turn around for half a minute and; Poof! – now they're gone!"
2,23,Candace,Welcome to my world.
2,23,Phineas,"Wow, that must be really annoying."
2,23,Candace,"(Notices Perry) Oh, there you are, Perry. (Perry tiredly lies on the stone walk; she then pets him) At least you're still around. Do you like wearing pink?"
2,23,Major Monogram,"On behalf of the entire Agency, I like to thank you for your valiant service in one of our darkest hours. (places a medal and a fedora on Planty) Planty the Potted Plant, welcome to the Agency."
2,44,Man's voice,Last night's meteor may not have been as innocent as we thought...
2,44,Man,...look what happened to Dr. Zachary!
2,44,Phineas,(High-fives Ferb) Cool!
2,44,Candace,"Now what? (Walks into the living room) Alright, what are you guys up to?"
2,44,Phineas,Watching the Invasion of the Human Overlords marathon. They're playing all five movies tonight!
2,44,Candace,"Is that all? Pfft. Well enjoy your lame, colorless marathon. I'm heading back."
2,44,Candace,"Wait, who's that?!"
2,44,Phineas,That's Dr. Abernathy. He's a scientist!
2,44,Candace,He's kind of hunky for a 50s guy.
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""",Don't worry. I'll you keep safe.
2,44,Woman,"Thanks, doctor, but please call me Amanda."
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""",Alright... Amanda.
2,44,Candace,Sold! (Quickly sits on the couch) Get me up to speed.
2,44,Phineas,"The aliens are replacing the heads of all the humans with their own shape-shifting, multi-eyed heads, which can then assume the form of the host human."
2,44,Candace,"Get out, and then...?"
2,44,Ferb,"Once they replace more than 51% of all the humans, they can assume control the earth for their own nefarious purposes."
2,44,Candace,Shut up! And...?
2,44,Candace,No way! Is there no way to stop them?
2,44,Phineas,If only you can catch them if they're in their human state. That's when they're at their weakest.
2,44,Candace,Then how you can tell if they're aliens?
2,44,Phineas,"There's three kinds of ways to spot an alien. First, they have strange vocal patterns. They don't get human linguistics."
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""","Pass me that frie-bop, please."
2,44,Amanda,You mean this hammer?
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""","Oh, yes, hammer. Frie-bop is what we call it in Ohio... where I'm from."
2,44,Candace,What else?
2,44,Phineas,They're anatomically disproportionate.
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""",Now I need the sprigle-kronk.
2,44,Amanda,The what?
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""",Never mind. I'll get it.
2,44,Phineas,"But the clear sign is that they can safely remove any human head, and replace it with their own multi-eyed, shape shifting head."
2,44,Candace,"Well, yeah. I guess that will give it away."
2,44,Phineas,(pointing to the TV) Like this.
2,44,Amanda,Doctor? What's wrong. Are you alright?
2,44,"""Dr. Abernathy""","Yes, Amanda. I'm fine. We're all fine, and soon you will be too!"
2,44,Amanda,NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
2,44,Alien,"Sorry, Amanda, but we've waited long enough."
2,44,Amanda,NOOOO!!! (her head is in a jar) This can't be! What's happening?
2,44,The real Dr. Abernathy,I tried to warn you.
2,44,Amanda,"Doctor, your head is attached! You're human again!"
2,44,Dr. Abernathy,"Yes, and once Dr. Zachary returns from heading into those dark, ominous woods alone, with his not fully charged flashlight, you will be too... Amanda."
2,44,Amanda,"But it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me? I was a fool! (sobs) A fool...!"
2,44,Candace,"Oh, my gosh, you guys. That was awesome. Guys? Uh, guys? Wow, it's tomorrow already. I gotta find those guys and tell them how it ended. ... Guys, guys, guys, ugh--"
2,44,Candace,"Sorry, Mom. Have you seen the boys?"
2,44,Linda,"Yeah, I think they're upstairs. Can you do me a favor and take the laundry up? I'm late for an appointment."
2,44,Candace,"Sure, Mom."
2,44,Linda,"Thanks, hon. I'll be back."
2,44,Candace,"(Holding up a t-shirt) Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny. (Upstairs; at Ferb) Oh, there you are. You know, that movie was so..."
2,44,Ferb,(shouting indistinctly over computer)
2,44,Candace,"Oops, sorry. I'll just put these in your room.<"
2,44,Ferb's cousin,"(Scottish accent) Oh, I wish you were there, Ferb."
2,44,Ferb,So do I. Tell Uncle Angus and Aunt Mora thanks for the candy.
2,44,Ferb's cousin,Too right. Scotland out. Peace.
2,44,Candace,"Oh, hey, Phineas. Oh, my gosh, you missed it. By the end everyone got their heads back and everything went back to normal. Well, sort of. The entire laboratory disappeared. But I loved it. I can't look at anything the same way ever again."
2,44,Phineas,"Cool, glad you liked it."
2,44,Candace,"Ooh, I-- I almost forgot the coolest part. (In the backyard) Hey, guys. Guys. You're never gonna believe this. At the end, they-- (ominous theme playing) (gasps) Ferb? (sees what looks like Ferb removing his head, she screams and runs to the panic room) Oh, my gosh. Ferb's an alien. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason Ferb can remove his head. I mean, it's not like he had any of the other telltale signs, is it? Oh, no."
2,44,Candace,Strange vocal patterns...
2,44,Candace,"(Holding up a t-shirt) Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny."
2,44,Candace,Anatomically disproportionate... (gasps) THEY GOT TO FERRRRRB!!!!
2,44,Candace,"Phineas, Phineas! I-- I know you're gonna think I've completely lost it, but I'm pretty sure that Ferb is an alien. I've got to find his head and re-attach it."
2,44,Phineas,"My brother's an alien? How cool is that? But I think you may be letting your imagination get the best of you, sis."
2,44,Candace,"Oh, a non-believer, huh? Well, you know what? I'm gonna get proof. You'll see. Ferb's an alien!"
2,44,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,44,Major Monogram,"Sorry about the distraction, Agent P. The ladies are helping to, uh, (reading from a card) ""net-roy-er the lair."""
2,44,Carl,"Tré biens, Monsieur Monogram. Trés bien."
2,44,Maids,"Bonjour, Carl."
2,44,Carl,"Bonjour, Madame."
2,44,Maids,(giggles)
2,44,Major Monogram,"So we're having a bit of a cleanup here, which coincidentally is what Doofenshmirtz seem to be having as well. He's put some old ""-inators"" up for sale on an evil auction site. If one of those devices were to fall into the wrong hands, it could be catast—Could—Could you please wait for me to finish, Mimi?"
2,44,Fifi,"Non ""Mimi."" Fifi."
2,44,Major Monogram,"Oui, Fifi. (at himself) Oh, now I've lost my train of thought. (at Perry) Anyway, get out to Doof's place and put a stop to it. (at Carl) How much is this costing us, Carl?"
2,44,Carl,Une petite fortune.
2,44,Major Monogram,"""Petite."" That means small, right? Well done, Carl."
2,44,Maids,(giggling)
2,44,(Song,"""You're Not Ferb)"""
2,44,Candace,(screaming)
2,44,Candace,(screams)
2,44,Doofenshmirtz,"(opens the door) Oh, hello. You must be here about the ad, right? Well, come on in. It's right over here. (closes the door; dramatic music) Behold the Wrapped-Up-in-a-Nice-Little-Bow-Inator. (Perry, disguised as an evil scientist, blinks) I bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Well, let's say your nemesis is arriving sooner than expected and- And your place is a complete mess. (camera pans to a messy ""bedroom"") Tidying up is a snap (snaps fingers) with the press of this large, red button. (pushes aforesaid button) See? Wrapped up in a nice little bow. (close up of a box tied up with a red ribbon) You can also use it to hang your clothes on. (hangs one of his lab coats on the Inator) Just like a treadmill. (camera quickly pans to a treadmill with clothes hanging on it) So although my ad said firm, I am flexible, so make me an offer. (Perry blinks twice; Doofenshmirtz rubs a hand behind his head) Wow, you're a good negotiator. Okay, half price. (camera pans to a baseball bat and a container of baseballs) And I'll throw in my Druselstein minor-league baseball collection."
2,44,Candace,"(giggling) Well, Phineas, what do you think? Wait. Before you say anything, look at these photos. I stalked ""Ferb"" all day. (shows Phineas some photos) See? Proof positive. Ferb...is an ALIEN."
2,44,Phineas,"Um, well—"
2,44,Candace,"No, no, no, no, just wait till you see. Here, here."
2,44,Phineas,But—
2,44,Candace,"Here, here."
2,44,Phineas,But—
2,44,Candace,"Here and here. And listen to this: (whirring) See? That is an entirely different silence than the Ferb silence we're used to. Here, I'll pay it backwards. (Whirring)"
2,44,Phineas,Um...
2,44,Candace,"Fine. Here, here, wait, what about this hideous ball of goo?"
2,44,Phineas,"Listen, Candace, as cool as it would be for Ferb to be an alien, that's sadly not the case. Here, follow me and I'll show you."
2,44,Candace,"Wait, show me what?"
2,44,Phineas,"Ferb, old pal, our dear sister here thinks you may be a sinister extraterrestrial visitor."
2,44,Candace,I saw Ferb's head ripped off by a hideous alien monster.
2,44,Phineas,"Oh, you must mean this reverse power coupling unit we're repairing."
2,44,Candace,Reverse power coupling unit?
2,44,Phineas,Sure. That's all it was. Ferb's no more alien than you or me.
2,44,Candace,But—But what about all this evidence I've been collecting?
2,44,Phineas,"Well, even though Ferb's not an alien, we are fixing a spacecraft for a friend of Meap's."
2,44,Candace,"Wait, what?"
2,44,Phineas,We just finished and we're about to launch.
2,44,Candace,"Ferb, you're not an alien!...uh, you're about to launch? You guys are so busted, I'm getting Mom!"

2,44,Garbog,(speaks in alien dialect)
2,44,Candace,"Uh, I -- I -- (sobbing)"
2,44,Doofenshmirtz,Uh-oh.
2,44,Candace,"Mother? Is that you? I mean, really you?"
2,44,The real Linda,"Candace, I don't have time right now. I have frozens."
2,44,Candace,"Yep. That's you. (pushes her) Come on, Mom, quick!"
2,44,Phineas,"Nice design on that rocket gantry, by the way."
2,44,Candace,"(With her eyes closed) Please, please, please, please be there...!"
2,44,Linda,(flatly) And I'm seeing...the backyard.
2,44,Candace,NOOOOOO!!!!!
2,44,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,44,Candace,"(sobs) But it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me? I was a fool! (sobs again) A fool...!"

2,50,Phineas,"Oops. (He and Ferb watch, cringing as the board is going down hit by hammers, attacked by a leopard, among other things before it reaches the bottom and blows up) You know, it occurs to me we could get hurt. I guess the ""of doom"" in the name should've tipped us off. Well, Ferbooch, unfortunately, there's only one way down: the stairs."
2,50,Dentist,"Okay, Linda, you may feel a little pressure."
2,50,Candace,"Mom, you've gotta come home! Phineas and Ferb built a nightmare-rail-skate-ramp of doom on top of the house! You've gotta—!"
2,50,Linda,"(Her words sound funny because she has a dental instrument in her mouth) Oh, you have got to be kidding me! In case you haven't notice I'm kind of in the middle of something here!"
2,50,Candace,Is that even English?
2,50,Linda and the dentist,Out!
2,50,Candace,"Alright, alright, jeez! Don't take it out on me; I'm the good guy here! (She leaves)"
2,50,Dentist,"Alright, let's get back to your root canal."
2,50,Linda,"Ah, thank goodness."
2,50,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella. What's up with the getup?"
2,50,Isabella,I'm going for my Intrepid Reporter Patch. Can I report on what you guys are doing?
2,50,Phineas,Sure.
2,50,Isabella,"Cool! Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, the Fireside Girl Gazette. Whatcha doin'?"
2,50,Phineas,Ferb and I have built the ultimate extreme skate track obstacle course!
2,50,Isabella,Awesome! I knew I could count on you for the coolest story ever! Have you attempted a run yet?
2,50,Phineas,"Well, we decided we need to make a few tweaks and adjustments so we can, you know, survive and stuff."
2,50,Isabella,"Okay, I'll be back in an hour. Hopefully I can make the Early Mid-Morning Edition! See ya! (She leaves)"
2,50,Phineas,"Hmm. Instead of modifying the track, maybe we should modify ourselves. Together we could be the best skateboarder ever! Hey, where's Perry?"
2,50,Monogram,"Agent P, we've just received an alarming message from Doofenshmirtz. Watch closely, and join us in girlish panic if you’re into it."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"(voice over) Citizens of Danville, I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have seized control of the Tri-State Area and am now your supreme leader. Seriously, life as you know it is over. (Shows him speaking to a crowd) Thank you and remember: Doof you, doof me, doof us! (In a small box on screen, he appears saying) I'm Heinz Doofenshmirtz and I approve this evil message."
2,50,Monogram,"With Doofenshmirtz in charge, no man, woman, child, or hat-wearing mammal is safe. You must find out what’s going on. (He puts on a wig and Carl gets in a baby carriage) Carl and I will be on the lamb, incognito. Good luck, Agent P!"
2,50,Phineas,"We have to blur the line between skateboard and skateboarder. We can combine dirt biking, ATV racing, in-line skating, street luge, motorized scooters, and Bulgarian folk dancing. Of course, all this extreme fun requires extreme safety: shoulder pads, goggles, gloves, Bulgarian folk athletic supporters, and rocket boosters, razor wire, grappling hooks and laser blaster. Then we lock it all in with an indestructible titanium exoskeleton which increases strength, jumping ability, and other physical attributes one hundred times, including the senses and folk dancing ability."
2,50,Phineas,"What, you think we should add more Bulgarian folk related elements?"
2,50,Phineas,"Oh, less! Less Bulgarian--okay, wow. I thought we were on the same page. But no. It's cool. Whatever. Time to suit up!"
2,50,Phineas,"Okay, video link active. (in a deeper, robotic voice) How you doin', Ferb? Oh cool! Look what it does to my voice! Ohhh, yeaaah. How about a little test run?"
2,50,(Song,Yippy Ki Yi Yay!)
2,50,Phineas,"(In the robotic voice) Hey, what's that? Turn down the music."
2,50,Buford,"(Distantly) He's stuck in a tree, and I can't get him down!"
2,50,Phineas,"(In the robotic voice) Sounds like Buford's in trouble. Hey, Ferb, maybe we can use this suit to help him. Hold on tight! (He jumps in the air) Hit the rocket boosters!"
2,50,Phineas,"(In the robotic voice) Whoa! Yeah, hey Ferb, check us out! We're flying!"
2,50,Isabella,"Phineas, I'm back! Phineas? Ferb? (She sighs) Well, I guess there goes my Early Mid-Morning Edition story..."
2,50,Phineas,(In the robotic voice) There they are!
2,50,Buford,"Help, my nerd is stuck in a tree! (Clicks his tongue holding up a piece of paper and a calculator) Look, it's your favorite calculator and some math problems!"
2,50,Baljeet,"Oh! Fractions? (While he stands he loses his footing and falls, shouting)"
2,50,Buford,Baljeet!
2,50,Phineas,(In the robotic voice) I got you!
2,50,Isabella,What is that?
2,50,Baljeet,Oh! This is so much worse than hitting the ground! (Continues shouting)
2,50,Buford,(Hugs Baljeet) He saved my nerd!
2,50,Isabella,Wow! That was amazing! I can't believe Phineas and Ferb missed it...
2,50,Candace,"It's not fair. Every time I try to bust Phineas and Ferb it's always ""Candace, I'm shopping,"" ""Candace, I’m having root canal surgery,"" ""Candace, I'm deliberating with a sequestered jury. How did you even get in here?"" Then my-- (seeing Phineas and Ferb fly past in the super suit) Oh look, a flying man! (She suddenly stops) Wait a second. Isn't that impossible? Wait another second! Something impossible plus that thing existing in real life equals... (She gasps before pedaling toward home) Phineas and Ferb!"
2,50,Phineas,"(In the robotic voice) Well, we've figured out how to fly. Now we need to figure out how to stop flying. Deploying grappling hook!"
2,50,Phineas,"(In the robotic voice) Well, at least we stopped flying."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Ex-leaders of the Tri-State Area, I have called you here to help ease the citizens into this exchange of power."
2,50,Building Superintendent,I thought you called me here to re-caulk your tub.
2,50,Crossing Guard,I'm only the crossing guard at Fourth Street and Maple. I'm not really sure how much authority I have.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,Silence! Are you suggesting that I attempted to gather the leaders of the Tri-State Area but the best I could do was a crossing guard and my building super?
2,50,Crossing Guard,"No, but now that you mention it..."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Silence! Wrong! You're wrong! Do you know who that is? It's only Roger Doofenshmirtz, the mayor of Danville! So shut up! What do you know; you’re only a crossing guard!"
2,50,Crossing Guard,That's what I'm trying to tell you!
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,Silence!
2,50,Roger Doofenshmirtz,"I'm sorry, but if we're not really gonna plan Mom's birthday, then I gotta jet."
2,50,"Crossing Guard, Building Super","Yeah, us too."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, hey, hey, wait!"
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, great, Perry the Platypus. This is all I need... So what did you want to talk to me about-- (He's suddenly hit by a chair and Perry starts going toward him. Doofenshmirtz quickly tries to scoot away) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa!"
2,50,Phineas,"Wow, the suit makes the clean-up fast, fun and efficient! I feel bad about missing Isabella. I hope she found something else to write a story about."
2,50,Unknown blonde Fireside Girl,Early mid-morning edition! The Beak saves the geek! (Tosses the newspaper at the driveway)
2,50,Phineas,"(picks up newspaper) ""Superhero comes to Danville, by Isabella Garcia-Shapiro. I call him The Beak."" Hey, I like that. (During this sentence the scene switches to Khaka Peu Peu's house, with him reading as well) ""With The Beak watching over us, everyone in Danville is free to have..."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"""...the best day ever."" Best day ever, huh? (picks up an eye mask) We'll see about that."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu's Wife,Are you in there complainin' again about never havin' a good day in your life?
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Well, I never did! Where's my best day ever, thank you very much? Ha, I told her. (is hit by a chair) Oh!"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu's Wife,I heard that!
2,50,Phineas,"A superhero? That's not at all what we planned to do today! (His phone rings and he answers) Oh, hi, Isabella."
2,50,Isabella,"Phineas, where'd you go? You really let me down."
2,50,Phineas,"Yeah, sorry about that."
2,50,Isabella,It's a good thing something else came along for me to report on.
2,50,Phineas,"Yeah, I know, but, hey, maybe we can make it up to you."
2,50,Isabella,Really?
2,50,Phineas,"Yeah, how would you like an exclusive?"
2,50,Isabella,(Excited) Great! Meet me downtown in five minutes!
2,50,Phineas,"Will do. (He hangs up) Come on, we have to go tell Isabella we're The Beak."
2,50,Ferb,Ahem.
2,50,Phineas,"Fine, we can take the suit."
2,50,Candace,"I knew it was— (Is hit by a newspaper) Blech! ""Superhero comes to Danville."" Well, they're about to get super-busted!"
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2,50,The Beak,"Well, I've gotta admit this flying thing is pretty fun. Hey, look, there's Isabella. Yo, Isabella-- (He's hit into a building by Khaka Peu Peu)"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Take that, birdbrain! Behold, the Khaka Crawler. I built it in my basement out of discarded washers and dryers, thank you very much. And I'm gonna make sure no one has the best day ever!"
2,50,Monogram,Hide my baby!
2,50,Isabella,"Phineas, where are you? There's this giant robot machine attacking downtown Danville! I'm all alone here! Call me as soon as you get this. (To herself) Come on, Isabella, this is what being an intrepid reporter is all about!"
2,50,Roger Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, this is not good, Melanie. I'll bet they'll try and pin this on me."
2,50,Melanie,"It's not like you're the one who used the unsigned proposal for defending Danville from giant robot attacks as a coaster. Oh, wait, you were."
2,50,Roger Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, it's so easy to blame the guy in charge. ""The guy in charge."" Ha-ha! That's it."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"And... whoa! Uh, you know that whole taking over the Tri-State Area thing? I-I was just bluffing. I-- I hoped maybe if I just told everyone I was in charge, they'd be too lazy or too busy to, you know, actually... check. (His phone rings) Oh, hello, Roger. (He makes a face to Perry) Uh-huh. What? You are? Me? In charge? It worked? You're kidding! Y-You're not kidding?"
2,50,Isabella,"Oh, where is Phineas? He'd know what to do. Please, Phineas. Where are you?"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Who knew wrecking everyone's day would be this much fun?
2,50,The Beak,"Hey, you!"
2,50,Isabella,The Beak!
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Oh, you're back for more, thank you very much."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Oh, great. Now I have to restart, thank you very much."
2,50,The Beak,"Dude, who are you, anyway?"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"If you're here to give Danville the best day ever, then I'm here to give Danville the worst day ever. You can call me ""Khaka Peu Peu!"" (The crowd laughs) What? Oh, come on. It's a family name, loosely translated as ""The Strong Fist,"" or ""That Strong Fist."" Thank you very much!"
2,50,The Beak,"All right, let's wrap this up. (He uses the grappling hook to wrap up the legs of the Khaka Crawler) Hey, cool, my first superhero pun."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"(Sarcastically) Well, don't quit your day job, Mr. Comedian."
2,50,Man,"Actually, I thought it was pretty clever."
2,50,Charles,"Yeah, 'cause, see, it, it wrapped around the legs."
2,50,The Beak,"If you didn't like that one, maybe this'll be a hit. (He hits the Khaka Crawler into the air with one of its legs)"
2,50,Charles,"(To the man beside him) Yeah, see, 'cause--'cause he hit him."
2,50,Man,"I'm not an idiot, Charles."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,This isn't over. You haven't seen the last of Khaka Peu Peu! I'll come at you through what's most important to you. Thank you very much!
2,50,Isabella,You were amazing!
2,50,The Beak,Huh?
2,50,Isabella,"Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, the Fireside Girl Gazette. Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions?"
2,50,The Beak,"Um, I can't talk right now. Gotta go, bye. (He flies off)"
2,50,Isabella,"Oh, uh, okay. Bye. Thanks for saving me."
2,50,The Beak,"We can't tell Isabella we're The Beak now. That would put her in danger. The life of a superhero is a lonely one, Ferb. Even after only eleven minutes."
2,50,Narrator,What will become of our heroes now? Find out in the next exciting episode of The Beak.
2,50,Narrator,"We now return to suburban Danville, where things continue to happen."
2,50,Stacy,Are you sure Phineas and Ferb are really The Beak? He's just so heroic and hunky.
2,50,Candace,"Ugh! Barf-aroni with cheese! Stacy, please. Phineas and Ferb are doing something totally bustable that's also mobile. We can lure them right to Mom to bust themselves."
2,50,Stacy,And how exactly will we do this?
2,50,Candace,"Well, if they wanna play superhero, then we're gonna play super-villain. Call me The Dangiraffe."
2,50,Stacy,"Right, and where do I fit in?"
2,50,Candace,You'll be my henchman.
2,50,Stacy,Your what?
2,50,Candace,It's like the bridesmaid of crime.
2,50,Stacy,"Okay, got it. Although, it looks like they've got their hands full with Khaka Peu Peu."
2,50,Candace,"That's obviously some big, stupid dress-up game they're playing with their little loser friends. Now, if my research is correct, the way to defeat a superhero is to come at him through what's important to him. (She holds up a picture of the boys and Linda before laughing maniacally)"
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, check this place out. Suh-wanky. Melanie?"
2,50,Melanie,"Hello, Heinz."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, please call me Supreme Leader Doofenshmirtz. The Great."
2,50,Melanie,No.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I see Roger left me a note. Let's see. ""Bro, thanks for filling in for me. You're going to make a great fall guy. I mean, mayor."" Aw, that's so sweet. (Perry shakes a box he's holding) Go ahead and put that on my new desk. (Perry sets it down only to have it wrap around him, trapping him) Ha ha! Made you carry your own trap. Now, my first order of business is to make all the citizens of Danville bow down--"
2,50,Melanie,"No, it's not. Here's your schedule and all your missed phone calls. Let's focus."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, uh, wow, uh, okay..."
2,50,Melanie,"And if you hadn't noticed, the city is in the grip of fear and panic caused by an evil super-villain intent on destroying our way of life."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,What? But--but that's my job!
2,50,Phineas,There. You can't even tell we've built our secret lair up in the tree.
2,50,Isabella,"Hi, guys."
2,50,Phineas,"(Hides the remote behind his back) Nothing! I mean, hi, Isabella. We're not doing-- Nothing!"
2,50,Isabella,Where have you been?
2,50,Phineas,"(He scratches his ear) Um, oh, you know us. Busy, busy, busy."
2,50,Isabella,"Right. While you two were busy making sure your summer day was ""fun"", other people were busy saving Danville. (She holds out a newspaper showing the Beak)"
2,50,Phineas,"(He scratches his ear again) The Beak, huh? Check it out, Ferb. A real superhero."
2,50,Isabella,And I need your help to find him. I thought there might be some clues in the photos I took that could help him stop Khaka Peu Peu.
2,50,Ferb,(Snorts at the name)
2,50,Isabella,"Fine, if you guys aren't going to take this seriously, I'll find The Beak on my own."
2,50,Phineas,"Isabella, wait."
2,50,Isabella,"I gotta go. Bye, Phineas. (She leaves)"
2,50,Phineas,"Ferb, to the nest."
2,50,Phineas,"Ready, Ferb? Let's wing it."
2,50,The Beak,Ba-caw!
2,50,(Song,The Beak)
2,50,Candace,"(She calls Phineas' phone) Phineas, quick, Mom is in danger! (She screams before hanging up) And the award goes to... Oh, wait, shoot. (She calls him again) On the corner of Fourth Street and Maple Drive! (screams before hanging up again) Beautiful! Now it's all up to The Dangiraffe."
2,50,Stacy,So then what does The Dangerbil do?
2,50,Candace,I told you. You're my henchman. Hench or something.
2,50,Stacy,"Oh, no, you did not just tell me to hench."
2,50,Candace,"Okay, just watch my bike! (She chuckles evilly as she runs passed her mom, grabbing her purse)"
2,50,Linda,"Candace, what on Earth are you doing?"
2,50,Candace,"Err, give, woman!"
2,50,Linda,What do you need? Gum?
2,50,Candace,"Help, help! I'm taking her purse!"
2,50,Linda,"Here, honey, here's a 20. Why don't you go see a movie?"
2,50,Candace,Aha! I stole 20 bucks from this woman! Help! The Beak!
2,50,Phineas,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Candace. Everything okay?"
2,50,Candace,What? Where's The Beak? Mom's been robbed.
2,50,Linda,"Oh, yes, right. Apparently Giraffe Girl has robbed me."
2,50,Candace,"Oh, come on, admit it. You two are superheroes."
2,50,Phineas,"Well, Ferb has been working out. Thanks for noticing."
2,50,Candace,Tell her the truth. You're making me look ridiculous.
2,50,Linda,Way too easy.
2,50,Stacy,I lost your bike.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, as much as I hate joining forces with good, I need to take my responsibilities as mayor very seriously, if I plan to abuse the position later, so... (He presses something on his desk) Melanie, have you gotten me the phone number of The Beak--?"
2,50,Melanie,That's your stapler.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oops, sorry. (He presses something on his desk again) Have you gotten the phone number of The Be--?"
2,50,Melanie,Still your stapler.
2,50,Candace,"""Apparently Giraffe Girl has robbed me."" ""Ferb has been working out."" ""Excuse me; my child can't see the movie over your monstrous giraffe head!"" Oh, I'll show them. I'll show them all."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Hello there.
2,50,Candace,"(screams) Hey, you're Khaka Peu Peu. (Snorts) No offense."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"None taken, thank you very much. I had no idea we had another player in this game."
2,50,Candace,Aha! I knew it. It's all some stupid game. I'm The Dangiraffe.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Right... What do you say we join forces to defeat The Beak?
2,50,Candace,"Fine, but if my friends see us, I don't know you."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Hmmm...
2,50,Phineas,"Come on, Ferb. Let's get back to the nest."
2,50,Isabella,"Oh, hello, Ferb. Phineas."
2,50,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella. Sorry we had to duck out on you earlier."
2,50,Isabella,"Well, that's okay. It's just kind of weird for me not to know where you are or whatcha doin'."
2,50,Phineas,Fair enough.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Miss Garcia-Shapiro? I've got your next headline: ""Everybody's day ruined once and for all and The Beak powerless to save it!"""
2,50,Isabella,"Um, it's a little wordy for a headline."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Enough! Okay, Danville, nothing ruins a day faster than unexpected... rain showers."
2,50,Man,You monster! Now I'm wet.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,(laughing maniacally)
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,Melanie?
2,50,Melanie,That's your tape dispenser.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,Mela--
2,50,Melanie,Paperweight.
2,50,Isabella,"Oh, no. This is terrible. I'm so glad you're here with me, Phineas. Come on, we can cover the action better from the top of City Hall! (She starts running toward city hall, before she notices Phineas isn’t with her) Phineas?"
2,50,Phineas,"I'm sorry, Isabella. We can't go with you."
2,50,Isabella,You're gonna leave me again?!
2,50,Phineas,You're gonna have to trust me. Have I ever let you down?
2,50,Isabella,"Yes. Like, four times today alone."
2,50,Phineas,"I'm sorry, Isabella. Maybe one day you'll understand. Come on, Ferb. Let's roll. (He and Ferb head back home)"
2,50,Isabella,"Phineas, don't you leave me! Phineas!!"
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Melanie, could you come in here--"
2,50,Melanie,And that would be a bowl of mints.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,I've got my finger in a bowl of mints?
2,50,Melanie,"Yes, you do."
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, well, that would explain why there are so many buttons."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,I guess your superhero turned out to be a chicken beak. (imitating a chicken)
2,50,The Beak,"Well, which came first, the chicken or the egg? (He shoots Khaka Peu Peu with an egg)"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Ugh! Well, I've got a surprise for you too. I'm not alone this time. May I introduce... The Dangiraffe!"
2,50,Candace,Busted.
2,50,Man,"(Gasps) Her name's funny, but not ha-ha funny."
2,50,The Beak,"Oh, no. He's got Candace. I can't believe it. He actually found out what was important to us."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Your move, worm breath."
2,50,The Beak,"Um, okay, I give up."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Then to the death it i-- Wait, what?"
2,50,The Beak,You win.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Huh? Why?
2,50,The Beak,"Well, 'cause you've got her."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,What? The Dangiraffe? You're kidding! She's just my henchman.
2,50,Candace,"Oh, I do not hench, thank you very much. Dangiraffe is out. Peace."
2,50,The Beak,Ba-caw.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Wait. How did he get so far away?
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Melanie, do we even have an intercom?"
2,50,Melanie,We do not.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, look, it's The Beak. Awesome! I'm gonna go check it out."
2,50,Isabella,"Whoa! (She falls off City Hall and screams, barely grabbing onto the edge of the building) Help!"
2,50,The Beak,"Oh, no! Isabella!"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"And that's not all, do-gooder. Watch as I destroy the very symbol of good days everywhere!"
2,50,Isabella,"Beak, save me!"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Uh-oh, two problems, one Beak."
2,50,Isabella,I can't hold on! Aah!
2,50,Phineas,Gotcha!
2,50,Isabella,Phineas! But what happened to The Beak?
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Come back here, you!"
2,50,Isabella,"Thanks for coming back, Phineas."
2,50,Phineas,"No problem. Ah, gotta go. (He runs and jumps off of the edge of the building)"
2,50,Isabella,(gasps before running over)
2,50,The Beak,"Don't worry, your friend's fine. He landed on a... ledge, but don't look for me because he... crawled in a window. You know, perhaps I'm over-explaining this. Gotta go! (He flies back to Khaka Peu Peu knocking down the Khaka Crawler)"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Admit it, you're having a bad day."
2,50,The Beak,Never! Nothing's gonna stop me from having the best day ever.
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Oh, yeah? Well, I never had a best day ever. Thank you very much."
2,50,The Beak,"I get it, Ferb. All this guy ever wanted was to have the best day ever. You know what we have to do, right?"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Now, Beak, we finish it."
2,50,The Beak,"I coul-- (He takes off the mask, causing Phineas' voice to return to normal) --dn't agree more."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Huh?
2,50,Isabella,Phineas is The Beak?!
2,50,Candace,"(Sarcastically) Hey, you just earned your ""Uh-Durr"" Patch."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,You're just a couple of kids.
2,50,Phineas,"Sure, my name's Phineas and this is my brother Ferb."
2,50,Candace,"Mom, did you see them? Did you? Did you? Did you?"
2,50,Linda,"Um, no, the optometrist just dilated my pupils. Everything's actually a big, blurry blob at the moment. But get me. ""I'll be back."""
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,But there's no point in being a super villain if there's no superhero to fight with.
2,50,Phineas,Exactly. We were thinking of rebuilding our cool skateboard ramp. Wanna help? It'll be fun!
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Really? You want me to help? Wait a minute, how is that fun? It's like 85 degrees out here. That sounds dreadful!"
2,50,Phineas,But--
2,50,Isabella,But--
2,50,Candace,But--
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,Forget it! (He's knocked out of the Khaka Crawler after getting hit by a chair)
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu's Wife,Where you been?
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Oh, hi, honey."
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu's Wife,"Shoo-ush, you! You were supposed to take me shopping. I need me some more throwing chairs!"
2,50,Khaka Peu Peu,"Yes, dear. (He walks away, mumbling) There goes my day, thank you very much."
2,50,Phineas,"Well, it looks like he's gonna get his punishment after all. (He and Ferb walk away)"
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"Finally. It's my turn. (He jumps into the Khaka Crawler) Now, let the master show you how evil is done!"
2,50,Isabella,"Phineas, I'm sorry I doubted you. I should have known you were The Beak all along."
2,50,Phineas,"That's okay, Isabella. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you."
2,50,Isabella,I know you were just trying to protect me.
2,50,Doofenshmirtz,"What? (Perry jumps out of the suit while Doofenshmirtz begins to crash) Curse you, Perry the Beakapus!"
2,50,Phineas,What was that?!
2,50,Monogram,"Good work, Agent P."
2,50,Linda,"Oh, hey, my vision's clearing up. So, what did you want me to see?"
2,50,Candace,"Oh, forget it."
2,50,Linda,"Okay, then. Why don't we all go home for some snacks?"
2,50,Isabella,"(flirtatious) By the way, Phineas, you were very brave."
2,50,Phineas,(Obliviously) Thanks. You were too.
2,50,Ferb,"Um, hello? Entire lower half of amazing superhero here. (He sighs) I guess there's no glory in thighs."
2,50,Narrator,And so things pretty much worked out. I guess. Narrator guy is out. Peace.
2,50,(Song,The Beak)
2,51,(Scene opens up on the City Hall clock; it strikes 1,00)
2,51,Roger,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I announce the winner of this year's annual ""Mayor For A Day"" essay contest. For her brilliant essay entitled ""Why My Little Brothers Should Be Busted"", I relinquish my office as mayor for the day to Candace Flynn!"
2,51,Lawrence,"Oh, bravo! Bravissimo!"
2,51,Phineas,"Way to go, sis!"
2,51,Roger,"Miss Flynn has found the perfect metaphor for our troubled times. In this day and age, it is all of our responsibility to ""bust"" the ""little brothers"" of corporate greed to the ""mom"" of fiscal responsibility."
2,51,Person from the audience,"Hooray for ""busting little brothers"" being a perfect metaphor for our times!"
2,51,Linda,"Oh, that's great. I've been rushing home all summer long for a metaphor."
2,51,Roger,"Candace Flynn has that true, good ol' pioneering spirit represented by the founding men and woman who built this city using only what the land provided."
2,51,Person from the audience,Hooray for building things without the tools and technology we take for granted today!
2,51,Linda,Let's hope the city survives.
2,51,Phineas,"Building things without tools and technology? Hmm. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
2,51,Roger,I give you Candace Flynn.
2,51,Candace,"Uh, I think we should bust my brothers. Yes, um... when I was the queen of Mars, I..."
2,51,Roger,"All righty, then. Let's get you to your office. Candace Flynn, everybody!"
2,51,Phineas,Looks like Candace has a full day. And so do we. Let's bounce.
2,51,Roger,"And here we are. Oh, look at that. You get the big chair. And you get your own nameplate and a bowl of mints. Ooh! Picture op! Great! Melanie, I'm off to my appointment. You make sure the new mayor has everything she needs. Miss Flynn, you are in charge."
2,51,Candace,"In charge, huh? Time to make some new laws."
2,51,Melanie,You realize this is just a temporary position for show? You don't really have the power to...
2,51,Candace,"So, as a mayor, I officially give you the rest of the week off."
2,51,Melanie,"Well, that's really cute, but..."
2,51,Candace,With pay.
2,51,Melanie,"Melanie is out, peace!"
2,51,Candace,"Hey Stacy, how'd you like to be the assistant to the mayor?"
2,51,Stacy,Coolness. At your service.
2,51,Candace,At last. Candace Flynn is in charge.
2,51,Isabella,What'cha doin'?
2,51,Phineas,"We're going to build an authentic pioneer town in our own backyard. And we're only gonna use Dad's antique collection of pioneer tools to do it. That's the spirit, Ferb. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,51,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. Uh, sorry we have to meet here at the agency sauna. It's just that if we don't use it at least three times a month, we lose our privileges. Anyway, it's our old friend Doofenshmirtz again. He's been researching both theoretical physics and golf fashion. Sounds like an unholy combination. So we're sending you in undercover to stop him. Good luck, Agent P. Agent W! Ha ha! Didn't see you there. How's the old blow hole?"
2,51,Phineas,Let's get authentic.
2,51,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"" (Pioneer version))"
2,51,(Song,"""Ordinary Day"")"
2,51,Candace,"Okay, Stacy. Let's get busy. I have a city to run. (walks out the door) The task force recruits are looking pretty good. Wait a minute. New law: I'm the one one who can wear that color!"
2,51,Stacy,Duly noted.
2,51,Candace,(cuts somewhere else) New law: everything should be pretty. (cuts somewhere else) New law: free makeovers for the mayor.
2,51,Stacy,"Good one, Miss Mayor."
2,51,Candace,"New law: today is ""Free Clothing For The Mayor Day""! I'll take that! And I'll take that! And I'll take that! And I'll take that! And..."
2,51,Candace,(keeps making laws) New law! New law! New law!
2,51,Stacy,"Well, Looks like you've left your mark on Danville."
2,51,Candace,What?
2,51,Stacy,"I said, it looks like you've left your mark on..."
2,51,Candace,What?
2,51,Stacy,I've said...
2,51,Candace,"Hold on a sec, Stace. Can we kill the music, please?"
2,51,Stacy,"Oh, brother, I busted my pencil."
2,51,Candace,"Brother? Busted? I just realized. I, like so many other elected officials, have forgotten the very promises I made that got me into office in the first place!  That's it! I'm gonna bust my brothers!"
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,"(on phone) Yes, Mother, I know I promised that I'd spend some quality time with my brother, but, golf? Really? I mean... No, I am not a big baby! I, uh, I am not! Oh, there he is now. Goodbye, Mother. (hangs up)"
2,51,Roger,"Hello, brother dear. Sorry we're late. Couldn't be helped. You know how it is. Traffic was terrible and I've already wasted half a morning not caring at all about being punctual for our golf game. Oh, and this is my caddy, Katie."
2,51,Katie,(giggles)
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey...hey, where's my caddy?"
2,51,Perry,(chatters)
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Say, you're not my regular caddy."
2,51,Roger,"Oh, lighten up, Heinz. You know what they say, ""You can't be tee'd off once you've teed-off."" Heh-heh-heh. That was very funny."
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,What? Who says that?
2,51,Roger,"You know, ""They."" (points over to his left) Those guys over there."
2,51,"""They""",You can't be tee'd off once you've teed-off.
2,51,Roger,"Creepy, huh? I've been trying to ditch those guys all day."
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,(to Perry) Are you sure we haven't met before? You look so familiar. Something about your platypus-like beak. Hmmm. Can't quite put my finger on it.
2,51,Phineas,"Well, we're almost done. All we gotta do now is get rid of those cattle wrestlers."
2,51,Lucha Wrestler,Tag me in! Tag me in!
2,51,Old Coot,Ha! Galldang idgets!
2,51,Isabella,Who's that guy?
2,51,Phineas,He's the Old Coot. Every frontier town had one.

2,51,Buford,"Man, he sure can spit."
2,51,Old Coot,You tenderfoots better high tail on outta here if you know what's good fer ya! This here town was built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground! (spits again)
2,51,Phineas,"Actually, this is our backyard."
2,51,Old Coot,"If you find any gold, it's mine!"
2,51,Phineas,"Uh, okay."
2,51,Old Coot,"(whooping) If you find any gold, it's mine!"
2,51,Secret Service Man,"That's right, Madam Mayor, we're sending you video now."
2,51,Candace,"That's it, boys. Good work. (to Stacy) It seems they've built some sort of lame town in our backyard."
2,51,Stacy,It looks like they've done a pretty good job.
2,51,Candace,"Really, Stacy? Really? (on phone) Gather the press and the media and get them to my house! This time those pests are goin' down! (hangs up)"
2,51,Stacy,(to the tune of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony) ♪ Dun dun dun duuuuuuunnnn... ♪
2,51,Roger,"Heinz! Wake up, Heinz, we're on to the next hole already."
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I hate golf! It's boring to watch and tedious to play. That's why I came prepared. You think this is a normal golf bag, don't you? But when I twist this club here... (an inator appears on the green) Behold, the Accelerate-inator! With the Accelerate-inator, I can fast-forward my brother through this boring golf game in seconds. (looks through the monitor) Ah, there he is. Let's give it a shot. Fast forward!"
2,51,(Song,"""Platypus Walk"" (instrumental))"
2,51,Doofenshmirtz (cont'd),"Hee hee hee! Oh, yeah! Yeah, look at him go! Hee hee hee hee hee!"
2,51,Candace,"Welcome, everyone, to the Big Bust! Today you shall bear witness as I bust my brothers!"
2,51,Everyone,"Yay, metaphors!"
2,51,Candace,"(to a Secret Service guy) I want you to take the limo, pick up my mom and dad and bring them back, stat! (The Secret Service guy salutes and leaves.) Oh yeah!"
2,51,Phineas,"Well, guys, we did it. A one hundred percent historically accurate old-timey pioneer town."
2,51,Baljeet,"Yes, complete with hitching posts."
2,51,Buford,(showing a snake on his hand) And snake bites.
2,51,Baljeet,(showing a huge blemish on his butt) And deer ticks.
2,51,Buford,(lifting up his shirt) And various sores I'll be nursing for months.
2,51,Phineas,"Yep. It took a whole lot of toil, pain, sweat, and hard work to build this town. We should be proud."
2,51,Ferb,Let's never do that again.
2,51,Phineas,"Agreed. Come on, let's go inside the house for a snack. (They walk out.)"
2,51,Isabella,And air conditioning.
2,51,Buford,And indoor toilets.
2,51,Chauffeur,Mr. and Mrs. Flynn? Mayor Candace urgently requests your immediate presence at the Flynn household.
2,51,Linda,And so it begins.
2,51,Lawrence,"Oh, yes, I could certainly get used to this."
2,51,Linda,Hello?
2,51,Candace,"Hey, Mom!"
2,51,Linda,"Yes, Candace?"
2,51,Candace,I was just checking to see your approximate arrival time at the Flynn household.
2,51,Linda,"Candace, this isn't another rant about some imaginary thing your brothers are building, is it?"
2,51,Candace,"(unhinged) No, Mom! I'm not crazy! (laughs insanely) So what time?"
2,51,Linda,We're just down the street. We should be home in a few minutes.
2,51,Candace,"¡Perfecto! Adieu, maman. (hangs up)"
2,51,Linda,I wonder what will be waiting for me today. An invisible thing or a non-existent thing?
2,51,Linda,(offscreen) I don't believe it! (rolls down window) What on Earth?!
2,51,Candace,"It's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I give you... (pulls down curtain to the Rollercoaster fanfare as cheering is heard) what you've all been waiting for!"
2,51,Reporter,Look! It's a perfect metaphor that we should return to simpler times and values!
2,51,Candace,That's not exactly what I meant.
2,51,Reporter,Ha! A perfect metaphor for how history teaches us about our future!
2,51,Candace,"That's pretty good, but no."
2,51,Reporter,It's a metaphor for—
2,51,Candace,NOT EVERYTHING IS A METAPHOR!!!
2,51,Linda,"Candace, what on Earth is going on here?"
2,51,Candace,"Mom, you know all those times I've tried to fill you in on the crazy stunts Phineas and Ferb have been up to?"
2,51,Linda,"Yes, Candace."
2,51,Candace,"Well, this is one of those times!"
2,51,Linda,(gasps) Phineas!! Ferb!! Get out here this second!
2,51,Phineas,"Hey, Mom's home!"
2,51,Linda,"I'm sorry, Candace. Now I know all the crazy exploits you told me about were true."
2,51,Roger,Amazing! The ninth hole already? Feels like we just started and we're halfway through.
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,"(laughs) This is fun! There's just...one tiny, minor flaw to this machine. There's a good chance it could tear apart the very fabric of space-time, possibly even destroy the universe. But I mean, golf, jeesh! Totally worth it. (Perry runs off) Whadaya say we amp this up a little? (Perry whacks the inator with a golf club.) What, are you out of your mind?! (The scene reverses.) !?dnim ruoy fo tuo uoy era ,tahW"

2,51,Montage,"During the reversal, we see Phineas and the gang in the living room, Candace revealing the town, and the parents in the limo.   At one point, a giant alien rips a hole in the universe, and Doof and Perry change into different outfits such as musketeers, cannibal and explorer, housewife and husband, and ancient Egyptians.  The reversal finally stops where we came in at the beginning of the episode."
2,51,(Scene opens up on the City Hall clock; it strikes 1,00)
2,51,Roger,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I announce the winner of this year's annual ""Mayor For A Day"" essay contest."
2,51,Doofenshmirtz,(groans) What is keeping Roger? He's so rude. It's a good thing I have my Accelerator— (Cut to reveal the Baby alien with his hammer near the inator.) Hey! What are you doing?!  (The baby alien destroys the inator effecting the space-time continuum once more.)
2,51,Roger,Congratulations to our own local Old Coot!
2,51,Old Coot,"(approaching the podium) New law: If ya find any gold, it's mine! (spits)"
2,51,Everyone,"Hooray for finding gold being a metaphor for...Oh, wait. I think we're supposed to take that literally."
2,51,Candace,Pssh! I was robbed!
2,45,Candace,"Hurry, Mom! You're nobody unless you're somebody in Glosstacular lipstick!"
2,45,Linda,"All right, Candace. At least let me stop the car."
2,45,Candace,I'm nobody unless I'm somebody! I'm nobody unless I'm somebody!
2,45,Linda,"I want you boys to pick out some nice back-to-school clothes. (Phineas, Ferb, and Linda enters the store, and presently walk back out) Wow, that was fast."
2,45,Phineas,"Well, we do have a signature look. (Phineas sheepishly grins as they have the opposite clothes) Although Perry's mixing it up a bit."
2,45,Linda,"Cute. Okay, here's some quarters for the arcade. I'm gonna see what's keeping your sister."
2,45,Phineas,"Okay. See you later, Mom. With this many quarters we can play seventy-two straight hours of– Hey, check it out. This was my favorite ride when I was little."
2,45,Repairman,"Better enjoy it while you can, boys. These old fellows are pretty worn out. I'll be back in a little while to haul them away."
2,45,Phineas,What a shame. I wonder if they're still as much fun as they used to be.
2,45,Phineas,"You know, in retrospect, I may have over-romanticized those memories. But I'll bet with a little effort and some unstable uranium isotopes, we could make them that much fun. Ferb, I know what we're gonna– Hey, where's Perry?"
2,45,Buford,"(playing a DDR-equse game with Baljeet as Perry walks past) Oh, get with the beat. You're messing up my score."
2,45,Major Monogram,"Carl, are you sure I don't have any more clean uniforms?"
2,45,Carl,"That's the last one, sir."
2,45,Major Monogram,"I mean, seriously. I'm growing mushrooms under here. (He sniffs himself) I don't smell too bad, do I?"
2,45,Carl,I can't smell a thing.
2,45,Major Monogram,"Well, that's a relief. I thought maybe I was–"
2,45,Carl,"No, I can't smell a thing, sir, I have no sense of smell."
2,45,Major Monogram,Really?
2,45,Carl,"I was born without nostrils, sir."
2,45,Major Monogram,"Oh, I thought you were joking about that on your resume. (Perry arrives) Ah, Agent P. Uh, just give me a few seconds. (Major Monogram transfers to the screen of the video game cabinet) Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up every can of aerosol deodorant in the Tri-State Area. And I'm starting to smell like a science-fiction convention. We need you to find out what he's doing with all those aerosol spray cans and put a stop to it. Good luck, Agent P."
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,I just called in a to-go order for Doofenshmirtz.
2,45,Waitress,"Hey, Vic? You got an order for Doofyberg?"
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, no, ""Doofenshmirtz."" Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Surely you've heard of me."
2,45,Waitress,"Okay, order for Hans Doofensmit. Is that right?"
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"No, ""Doofenshmirtz."" Doofen-- My brother is the mayor."
2,45,Waitress,Roger Doofenshmirtz is your brother?
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, Doofenshmirtz."
2,45,Waitress,And your name is?
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
2,45,Waitress,Do we have an order for a Hans Doofenblatz?
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"(growls in anger) Mark my words. You will remember the name of Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Hm! (He walks out of the diner, but soon pops his head back in) Could I still get my whole wheat on rye?"
2,45,Waitress,"Sure, what's your name?"
2,45,Phineas,All done.
2,45,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'?"
2,45,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Isabella."
2,45,Buford,"Hey, losers."
2,45,Phineas,"Oh, hey, guys."
2,45,Buford,Don't tell me you're playing with that lame kiddie ride.
2,45,Phineas,"We've tricked it out, and now it's pretty awesome."
2,45,Buford,"I'll be the judge of that, step aside. This better be worth a quarter. (Sarcastically, as the ride shakes back and forth) Ooh. This is so exciting. Let me catch my breath."
2,45,Baljeet,"What is not to like? It has what every kid loves: rocking back-and-forth, and slowness."
2,45,Phineas,May I suggest pressing that red button?
2,45,Buford,"Ooh, can I? (He presses the red button, and the ride sprouts a rocket engine and takes off)"
2,45,Phineas,"So, what do you think?"
2,45,Buford,(Screaming) I got it. Woo-hoo! This is awesome!
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. How predictable. And by ""predictable,"" I mean completely...dictable, I guess. Anyway..."
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, don't bother trying to escape. The walls are made of a super-slick alloy and treated with a few dozen coats of non-stick cooking spray. I'm sure you've noticed my impressive collection of aerosol spray cans. Every can of aerosol deodorant, hair spray and bug repellent from the Tri-State area. All mine. I'm tapping into their ozone-depleting propellants to fuel my latest evil scheme: The Aerosol-Propelled Ozone-Deplete-Inator! The citizens of Danville will definitely learn the name of Heinz Doofenshmirtz, when I spell it out in the sky in hundred-foot-tall letters made of atmosphere-destroying aerosol gasses, thereby depleting the protective ozone layer. And the resulting radiation will burn my name right through town! Then they'll remember. And if they don't, they can just look outside. (He cackles) I need a little drink of water after a tirade like that."
2,45,Candace,"Ah, Glosstaculick! Now I can blow up a bounce house and my lips would still be shiny! (She starts to put on lipstick, but Buford zips past her, ruining it; now in busting mode) I bet Phineas and Ferb are behind this..."
2,45,Buford,"Wow, that was fun."
2,45,Candace,"(walks up to them) I've got you this time! And to make sure this doesn't disappear, I'm going to sit here on the evidence 'till Mom comes back!"
2,45,Buford,This is gonna be worth a quarter.
2,45,Candace,Help me!
2,45,Phineas,"Hang on, Candace, we're right behind you. Good thing we tricked out the other rides. Come on."
2,45,(Song,"""Ain't No Kiddie Ride"")"
2,45,Candace,Phineas!
2,45,Phineas,"Hang on, Candace! We're coming!"
2,45,Phineas,"Nuts. Lost her in the skyline. Isabella, we need you to get us an aerial view."
2,45,Isabella,"Sure, Phineas. Whee!"
2,45,Farmer,"Well, what do you know? Nostradamus was right."
2,45,Isabella,"Wow, she just flew through a barn and her lips are still shiny."
2,45,Baljeet,"Oh, my friends. It appears that I am out of fuel."
2,45,Phineas,"No, Baljeet. (On radio) Just put in another quarter."
2,45,Baljeet,"But all I have is a dollar. (He notices that the machine takes bills) Oh. What do you know. (He tries several times to get the ride to take his dollar, but the machine won't) Hm. Oh, come on."
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, water. It's like drinking wet air. Now, Perry the Platypus, sit back and listen as the entire Tri-State Area screams the name Heinz Doofenshmirtz and never forgets it again! (Two aerosol cans fall into Perry's trap, and he uses them to propel his way out) Hold it right there, Perry the Platypus. (Doofenshmirtz tries to crush Perry with his giant mechanical hand, but Perry dodge it) Agh!"
2,45,Candace,"Uh-oh. (She screams) Phineas, help, I'm falling!"
2,45,Phineas,Just put in another quarter.
2,45,Candace,I don't have another quarter! (continues screaming)
2,45,(Song,"""Phinedroids and Ferbots"" Instrumental)"
2,45,Doofenshmirtz,"(He laughs) Hey, nice move, Perry the Platypus, I got to ""hand"" it to you. Here, let me give you a ""hand."" Hey, hey. I'm gonna crush you with my big mechanical ""hand."" Ha! Well, I– I guess that one was just literal, but I've got you now.  (Candace bursts through Doofenshmirtz's lair, cutting off the giant hand) Wow. Nostradamus was right! (Perry uses the giant hand to smack Doofenshmirtz into the trap he was previously in) Ow! You know, I don't come to your house and– Wait, these don't have any chlorofluorocarbons in them at all. These aerosol cans are completely harmless! Wh-what was I thinking!? Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
2,45,Isabella,"Okay, I got her. Yee-haw!"
2,45,Phineas,"Good work, everybody. Let's bring it on back to the store."
2,45,Phineas,"(At the store) (To Candace) Well, it looks like you made it back in one piece."
2,45,Candace,You guys are gonna be so busted when I show Mom what you did to those rides.
2,45,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,45,Repairman,"All right, one side, kids. We're replacing these old rides with brand-new identical ones. With special emphasis on the identical. See you."
2,45,Phineas,"Bye, now. Well, that was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can supe up our old bikes."
2,45,Buford,Lame.
2,45,Phineas,That's what you said about the kiddie rides.
2,45,Buford,"And I was right, until I wasn't."
2,45,Candace,"(Talking fast) Here it is, Mom, I'll show you! If you'll give me a quarter, please? (She sits in the ride)"
2,45,Linda,Aren't you a little old for kiddie rides?
2,45,Candace,"No, no, I'm not! Check it out! (puts quarter in ride)"
2,45,Linda,(dryly) Well...I guess it does have rocking back-and-forth and slowness?
2,45,Baljeet,"(After ironing his dollar bill) Okay, dollar, this is your last chance. (The ironing table goes off; Baljeet kicks ride in frustration, the ride goes off)"

2,53,Pilot,"(while an airplane makes its landing) Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be touching down in Hawaii momentarily, but remember aloha means ""hello"" and ""good bye"". Try not to get the two confused."
2,53,Wahanies,Aloha!
2,53,"Candace, Lawrence, Linda, Ferb, and Phineas",Aloha!
2,53,Lawrence,I do hope that was hello.
2,53,Phineas,"Wow, I've always wanted a vacation this close to a volcanic hot-spot. Do you smell what I smell, Ferb?"
2,53,Ferb,(sniffs) Hmm-mmm. Magma.
2,53,Linda,Your father and I are looking forward to the Annual Couple's Surfing Contest.
2,53,Lawrence,"Oh, I can't wait to wipe out!"
2,53,Linda,"Dear, ""wipe out"" means falling off the board."
2,53,Lawrence,"Yes, I know."
2,53,Candace,"Well, there's only one thing I'm saying hello-ha to! Relaxing! And taking a break from trying to bust Phineas and Ferb."
2,53,Candace,What? It's hard work!
2,53,Linda,"Come on, kids. Let's check out the gift shop while your father checks us in."
2,53,Lawrence,"Well, I am a little rusty on my Hawaiian, but here goes. Buenos dias, señor. Me llamo Lawrence. (Good day, sir. My name is Lawrence.)"
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Oh, no, no. That’s not necessary. We speak English here. Hawaii is part of the United States."
2,53,Lawrence,"Is it really? (pauses) How remarkable. Well, we're the Flynn-Fletcher family. Two adults, three children, (holding up a pet carrier with Perry inside it) and our pet platypus, Perry."
2,53,Hotel Manager,Excellent. Why don't you join your family while I get the bellhop to attend to your bags?
2,53,Lawrence,Wonderful.
2,53,Hotel Manager,"(on the phone) Help desk. Can we get a bell person in to pick up the family's bags and platypus. (pauses, then notices the now empty pet carrier) Oh, hey, where's Perry?"
2,53,Major Monogram,"(via a screen on a Tiki statue) Aloha, Agent P. I see you're able to subliminally persuade your host family to take their vacation in Hawaii. Still have no idea how you managed to do that."
2,53,Lawrence,"Okay, I'll decide where we go on vacation as soon as I clean out Perry's litter box. (looks into the litter box with the Hawaiian islands drawn on it) Hey, how about Hawaii?"
2,53,Major Monogram,"As you know, Doofenshmirtz is in the area of the Big Island. He's obviously up to no good. Find out what's he up to and put a stop to it."
2,53,Carl,(off screen) Sir?
2,53,Major Monogram,Uh... I promised Carl to get him one of those hula wigglers for his dashboard. He thinks it would be neat.
2,53,Candace,"Hey, what's this? Pineapple scented serenity lotion with SPF. ""Apply and feel instantly serene"". (to Linda) Mom! I totally need the serenity lotion!"
2,53,Phineas,"Check this out. ""Aqua Primates"". A-Primes, Ferb. (flips the box over) The back of the box shows them crowning the queen, fighting robots, and designing websites. Ferb, we've totally got to get this! Hey, not to be redundant, but... Where's Perry?"
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Well, first of all, I just want to state for the record that this island was not my first choice. I wanted Skull Island right over there, but it was already booked for Jacob Bernstein's Bar Mitzvah, and so all there was available was... Pink Unicorn Island."
2,53,Candace,"Preparing to relax. (walks out of the hotel) Boy, do I need this.... Ooh, why is there so many people here? ... Wait! Wait! One last chair! Excuse me! I was here first!"
2,53,Phineas,"Okay. Well, the A-Primes hatched, but they're really tiny. And it looks like they only do one trick: moving toward a light source. As impressive as it is, I bet if they were human sized, they can do all this stuff on the box. Hmmm. Ferb, do we have any more of that growth elixir?"
2,53,Phineas,"Hey, Candace."
2,53,Candace,"Phineas, I don't care if it's a Ferris wheel to Jupiter or a bionic meatloaf. I'm going to relax. Now go ahead. Run along."
2,53,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb. Time to dump them in."
2,53,Lifeguard,"Hey, what are you two kids doin'?"
2,53,Phineas,We're putting our A-Primes in the pool before they outgrow their container. Is that against the rules?
2,53,Lifeguard,"Well, let's see. (reads the rules from a board) ""No running, diving, pushing, or modern expressionism"". Nope, nothing here. You guys are good to go."
2,53,Phineas,Cool. (at Ferb) Let's add the A-Primes.
2,53,(Song,A-Prime Calypso)
2,53,Candace,"Alright, Candace. You're finally doing it. Relaxing. It's all good."
2,53,Yoga Instructor,"Aloha, molihini, or guests. In the spirit of lalauea, or peaceful relaxation, let me be your kumu, or teacher, in an outdoor yoga class free for hotel guests."
2,53,Candace,"Pathetic, isn't it? Some people don't have the discipline to relax on their own. They need to take a— Oh, who are you kidding? You're taking the class. A little extra serenity can't hurt. (covers herself with the serenity lotion) Oh, this stuff is slippery!"
2,53,Yoga Instructor,"Everybody, find a mat. So, let's start with a gentle standing back bend."
2,53,Candace,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (falls backwards into the pool)"
2,53,Phineas,"Uh, oh! Improbable creature wrangling time."
2,53,Candace,I knew it! I knew my obnoxious brothers would ruin my relaxation!
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"(shooing some cats away) Shoo, shoo! Get out of here! It's not a real fish! (at Perry) As I was saying, the De-Evolutionator will blast past the Pacific Ocean, bounce off the satellite, and completely blanket the Tri-State area, de-evolving everyone!"
2,53,Hotel Manager,"(to the A-Primes) Oh, um, excuse me. Excuse me!"
2,53,Phineas,"Hey, mister. Have you seen a group of giant, wet aqua primates running through here?"
2,53,Hotel Manager,(pointing to the right) Elevator!
2,53,Phineas,Thanks!
2,53,Hotel Manager,Hey!
2,53,Candace,You two are so busted!
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Hold it right there, young lady! I'm the manager of this hotel, and if there's going to be any busting to do, I'm going to do it."
2,53,Candace,"But... but... but... but... Wait, a minute. I'm on vacation, he is working. I pass the bust baton to you, sir! Aloha! (sighs in contentment)"
2,53,Phineas,(while he and Ferb case after the A-Primes) Come back here! ... Stop!
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Stop right there, young men! What is the meaning of this?"
2,53,Phineas,Uh... I'm not sure I understand your question.
2,53,Hotel Manager,(at the A-Primes) Stop! Come back here!
2,53,Phineas,"Wow. For someone living in Hawaii, he's awfully stressed."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,(noticing the size of his right ear) Okay. This I don't even get.
2,53,Candace,"Alright, Candace. You're finally doing it. Relaxing."
2,53,Hotel Manager,(to the A-Primes) Come back here! Stop!
2,53,Phineas,How are we going to round up the A-Primes?
2,53,Ferb,Hello? Room service?
2,53,Hotel Manager,Please? I'm going to call your mother!
2,53,Candace,555-0142!
2,53,Linda,"(via recording) Hello, you've reached Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and if this is Candace, I'm sure that what ever the boys are doing, is nothing."
2,53,Hotel Manager,(growls in frustration)
2,53,Linda,"Hon, Doc. Folberg and his wife are trying to drop in our wave."
2,53,Lawrence,"Ooo, those crazy coots! I'll just do an old-school drop de-turn on them, eh? Cut back up on the face, through the sloop, do a nice inner tail, and drop into the green room for a bit of tune time."
2,53,Linda,"You got that off the Internet, didn’t you?"
2,53,Lawrence,"Yes, yes I did."
2,53,Linda,Cowabunga!
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"What? What is it? Oh, great. Now I'm a single-celled organism. Now how am I going to drive home?"
2,53,Hotel Worker,You boys ordered a giant flashlight from room service?
2,53,Phineas,Yep.
2,53,Hotel Worker,You're in luck. We're just about to take that off the menu.
2,53,Phineas,(signs the form then hands it to the hotel worker) Here. (at Ferb) Let's switch this baby on. (switches the giant flashlight on) Hopefully the A-Primes haven't forgotten their one trick.
2,53,Hotel Manager,Are you Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher?
2,53,Linda,Yes?
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Your boys are doing something in the back, and you have to see it."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"No, wait! Don't throw that out! No! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Perfect. They're still here. (to Linda) Come quick! Come look! .... See? Look at the slimy, disgusting creatures."
2,53,Linda,"Well, that's not a very nice thing to say."
2,53,Phineas,"Hi, Mom."
2,53,Linda,"Hi, boys."
2,53,Candace,(giggling) Yeah.
2,53,Hotel Manager,But... but... but... but there were all these...
2,53,Linda,"My apologies if my daughter put you up to this. (at the boys and Candace) We'll be upstairs, kids."
2,53,Candace,"Oh, dude. I know, right?"
2,53,Linda,I'm starting to get the hang of it. I think this motion refers to the swaying of the palm trees.
2,53,Lawrence,"Oh, yeah; and this motion says this Brit can move it! I wonder how the boys are doing."
2,53,Phineas,"Nicely done, bro. We’re becoming quite the islanders."
2,53,Candace,"(at a sand sculpture of Jeremy) Oh, Jeremy. I must be the luckiest girl in Hawaii."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,Who could've guessed my De-Evolutionator would backfire on me?
2,53,Candace,"Aloha, bros."
2,53,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Cool necklace. Where did you get it?"
2,53,Candace,"Ah, you like it? It's my lucky charm. It was delivered to me by tranquil, Hawaiian waves. What are you up to?"
2,53,Phineas,"Well; we've done our share of terrain-based activities, so we’re going to try some semi-aquatic endeavors."
2,53,Candace,Speaking of semi-aquatic... Where's Perry?
2,53,Major Monogram,"Agent P. We still don't know the current whereabouts of Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but we're picking up a strange signal from the island of Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie. It could be a (???) for the missing De-Evolutionator. (folds up the map) You better investigate. Good luck, Agent P. (at Carl) Carl, more ice!"
2,53,Carl,"Coming, sir."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"With the De-Evolution-inator back in my hands, I can reverse the settings, and I'll have the most highly evolved brain on earth! (hits himself with the De-Evolutionator, only to have his head swell up) Now that I'm so smart, I don't think it was such a good idea."
2,53,Candace,"Oh, my precious, little good luck charm. I'm so glad I found you. (trips over a tackle box) Whoa! (face plants into the sand) Well. AAAAAAAHHH!!"
2,53,Single Guy,"If this wasn't meant to be, someone give me a sign?"
2,53,Candace,"(background voice) No, no, no, no, no! (slams into the window)"
2,53,Single Guy,"Well that's good enough for me. This single guy is out, peace!"
2,53,Candace,"Oh, my gosh. I could've been killed. I’m so glad I have my lucky charm. You totally saved my life."
2,53,Waiter,(screams)
2,53,Candace,"Agh! Well; that could've been a lot worse, but thanks to my lucky charm I can-- ... No worries! I got my lucky charm on. (screams) ... Well, I guess it could've been worse. ... Okay, that does it. This thing is totally bad luck. ... Well; little amulet, this girl doesn't any more misfortune. So bye-bye, bad luck! (tosses tiki charm into garbage can; mysterious music plays) Over it!"
2,53,Hotel Manager,"Ooh, nice necklace."
2,53,Candace,What?!? How’d this get back on! (screams) ... (at a native) Please help me! How do I get rid of this?
2,53,Native,"You must take it to the island of Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie to the top of the volcano, and..."
2,53,Candace,"Of course! It can only be destroyed if the first which it was formed. Hold on, volcano! I'm a-comin'!"
2,53,Native,"We work for tips, you know! (at himself) And, she's gone."
2,53,Candace,"Hey, I need a ride to Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie?"
2,53,Man,"Sure, just grab that tow line."
2,53,Candace,"Tow line? Do you mean... this? ... Hey, wait! Why is this happening to me? No more bad luck!"
2,53,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!
2,53,Phineas,"Wow, sis. Way to hang loose!"
2,53,Laird,"Cowabunga, kids!"
2,53,Phineas,Laird Hamilton?
2,53,Laird,"Last I checked. Say, aren't you dudes a little young to be riding this kinda surf?"
2,53,Ferb,"No worries, bro! We're just gonna hot dog this honker past the bone-yard to the sand."
2,53,Phineas,"You got that off the Internet, didn't you?"
2,53,Ferb,"Yes, yes I did."
2,53,Laird,"Alright, then. Hang loose, kooks. (at Candace) Later, wahanie."
2,53,Phineas,"Hang ten, water man! (at Candace) See you on shore, Candace!"
2,53,Candace,"I'm doomed. (ends up on shore with a manta ray stuck to her head) I'm cursed. (at the boys) Phineas, Ferb, I need your help. I can't get rid of this tiki charm."
2,53,Phineas,"Um, personally I'd be a little more worried about that manta ray stuck to your head."
2,53,Candace,"What? (looks up) Ugh. You know, after the day I've been having, I didn't even notice."
2,53,Phineas,"Here, Candace. Let's us get rid of it for you."
2,53,Candace,"That won't work. Every time I try to get rid of it, my luck gets even worse."
2,53,Phineas,"No worries, Candace. (takes the tiki charm from her then tosses it away) See? Nothing! No bad luck. Perfectly fine."
2,53,Candace,But... but... but... but...
2,53,Laird,"Wow, you got pounded. Let me give you a hand. (pulls the manta ray off Candace's head then throws it into the water) Looks you could use a little luck. (gives Candace the tiki charm) Here, I found this on the beach. (at the boys) Later, dawgs."
2,53,Phineas,"Later, brah!"
2,53,Candace,"See, it's back."
2,53,Phineas,What can we do to help?
2,53,Candace,We need to get to the top that volcano and throw it in.
2,53,Phineas,Alright then. I know what we're gonna do today!
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Being stranded on a deserted island is much easier with a normal sized head. Oh, I got something. ... It works! I found a platypus!"
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,(gasps) Perry the Platypus!?!
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Just because we're stranded on a deserted island, doesn't mean we should abandon our normal lives, don't you think? Because then the Tiki gods would win! (pauses) So, I made myself supreme ruler of the Tri-Coconut Area when no one was looking. It stretches all the way from the big rock over there where I'm drying my socks and undies to those three coconut trees at the end of the beach. And I have my minions. Look, if they don't obey, I eat them. What's that look?"
2,53,(Song,Bad Luck)
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus! I'm drawing a line in the sand. You are not allow to cross this line."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Smarty-pus! (Perry quickly looks up) Feast your eyes on this! Behold, the Sand-inator! (Perry glares) I bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Huh? Well... Well, it's easy. It causes great, irritating sand to wedge itself into your swim trunks, causing it to chaff, get a rash, and have a lousy day at the beach. How do you like...?"
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"I may be starving and dying of thirst, but at least I got my hovel. What does he got? Nothing! He's a platypus. They've... got like... webbed fingers and no opposable thumbs. Practically flippers."
2,53,Candace,Are we there yet?
2,53,Phineas,"For safety sake, I think Ferb and I should check out the scene before you go up."
2,53,Candace,"Oh, yeah. Whatever you say. I'm not taking any more chances."
2,53,Candace,"What's taking them so long? Phineas? Ferb? Oh, no. ... Uh?"
2,53,Linda,"Hey, Candace."
2,53,Candace,Mom?
2,53,Phineas,"(holding some tiki charms) Check it out, Candace. There's tons of these."
2,53,Native,"Hey, wahanie. Looks like you took the long way. Most people take the escalator, you know."
2,53,Candace,No! No! I can't handle any more bad luck.
2,53,Native,"It's not bad luck. That just means your table is ready. Let's see what other luck it brings you.... Ah, looks someone's getting a free dessert, huh?"
2,53,Candace,"No way, I don't want anything of that necklace brings me. Goodbye, good riddance, Candace is out, peace!"
2,53,Laird,I'll take that free dessert if you're not going to eat it.
2,53,Candace,No thanks. I just glad I got rid of... that... bad... luck.
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"I've got to get off this island. What I need is a BO-AT, or boat as I now been told how it's been pronounced. (notices Perry, who's loading bags of coconuts onto a boat) Oh, look! A BO-AT! ... A boat! (at Perry) Ah, Perry the Platypus. I've decided that our efforts would be better spent if we work together to get off the island. Here, let me help with it."
2,53,Major Monogram,"(emerging from the sand) Nice work, Agent P. Agent W will take it from here. (at Agent W via wristwatch communicator) Rubber ducky is in the water. Over. (at Perry) Uh... What do you say we get something to eat? I hear there's this great restaurant on the other side of the island. (holds up a tiki charm) I found one of these. Maybe we'll get a free dessert."
2,53,Candace,"Aah! Ow! Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha, ah! So long, Perry the Sucker-pus! Look after my minions! (at himself) Those little traitors! (pauses) Oh, for crying out loud!"
2,53,Doofenshmirtz,"(muffled) Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (at a coconut and a pelican) Listen up, both of you. Let's get one thing straight. I am supreme ruler of this place and don't you forget it!"
2,47,Candace,"(chaotic laugh) Ooooooh, you are so busted this time! (laughs) ♪ Busted, busted, busted, busted, tra-la-la, hey, hey! ♪ (car horn) Huh? Mom!!"
2,47,Candace,"(giggles) Mom, Mom, Mom! (opens car door)"
2,47,Linda,"Hi, honey."
2,47,Candace,(grabs Linda's arm with eyes closed) Wait til you see what Phineas and Ferb are up to now!
2,47,Candace,(laughs) See?!?...What?
2,47,Phineas,"Hey Mom, hey Candace."
2,47,Candace,"But, but but -- !"
2,47,Linda,(with disdain) I'm going to go check on my roast.
2,47,Candace,"URRRRRGH! (ties hair into bow) But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...but...but...but...but...but..."
2,47,Buford,(as he walks by a dismayed Candace) You've inspired me; I'm growing out my bangs.
2,47,Baljeet,"(as he also walks by) Namaste, compadres."
2,47,Candace,"(untying her hair) Ohhhhh, no matter what I try, I just can't do it! It's impossible!"
2,47,Isabella,The impossible is possible! With a little teamwork. That's what the Fireside Girls say.
2,47,Candace,Teamwork?
2,47,Isabella,Sure! How do you think I got this mountain-moving patch?
2,47,Candace,(pause) By...mindlessly repeating a flawed busting strategy?
2,47,Isabella,"Noooo, through teamwork! See that mountain over there? It used to be over there. With a little teamwork, you can do anything."
2,47,Candace,Teamwork. Teamwork! (dials phone) Stacy? I know what we're gonna do today.
2,47,Baljeet,Thank you for letting me choose today's activity.
2,47,Phineas,"No worries, Baljeet."
2,47,Buford,It is Nerd Awareness Week.
2,47,Baljeet,"It is called ""spinning tops."""
2,47,Buford,LAME!
2,47,Baljeet,Of DOOM!
2,47,Buford,Alright I'll give it a shot.
2,47,Baljeet,"Okay, everyone! Here is how you play: You hold your top...and then...you SPIN!"
2,47,Isabella,"So then, what?"
2,47,Baljeet,"YOU DO IT AGAIN! AH-HA-HA-HA! Ah. It is lame, isn't it?"
2,47,Phineas,"Not at all, Baljeet. It just needs a little more oomph."
2,47,Baljeet,I was hoping you would say that!
2,47,Phineas,"Anybody notice a distinct lack of egg-laying mammals in the backyard? Baljeet, would you do the honors?"
2,47,Baljeet,Boy howdy! Aham. Ah...
2,47,Major Monogram,"Where's Perry? Oh, there you are. Didn't uh...see ya...sittin' there. Anyway -- our sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz is up to something and if we're gonna put a stop to it, we'll need a little of that old egg-laying mammalian magic."
2,47,Major Monogram,"(gasp) Why how did -- oh, why that little scamp?"
2,47,Candace,"Alright, ladies. I've got a crew, I've got a plan, I wanna bust. Questions? (Stacy raises her hand) Stacy?"
2,47,Stacy,Do you have this jumpsuit in pink? Cause I'm not really a tangerine kind of gal.
2,47,Candace,(eye twitches) WHY IS EVERYTHING SO DIFFICULT?!? (sobs)
2,47,Jenny,"Maybe if we help her bust her brothers, she'll be done with all this busting stuff for good."
2,47,Stacy,"You're absolutely right, Jenny. Hey, Candace?"
2,47,Candace,Uh...
2,47,Stacy,"I was just kidding about the color, I love orange."
2,47,Jenny,"And I'm all about persimmon. So, what do we do next?"
2,47,Candace,"You've heard of Boot Camp? Well, ladies, welcome to Bust Camp!"
2,47,(Song,Bust Your Brothers)
2,47,Stacy,Mom.
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm, hurry up with that coffee! I still got that terrible morning taste in my mouth. (smacks lips)"
2,47,Norm,"Coming right up, sir! Scalding hot, just the way you -- (trips on rug, spills coffee) Whoopsie daisy!"
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"AAAAAAAAHHHH!!! Ow! I know I didn't make you that smart, but you can't even walk straight? (doorbell rings)"
2,47,Norm,"I'll get it. (opens door, delivery guy is there) You'll be so delighted when your package arrives in six-to-eight weeks."
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"My new nemesis toy! Go run my bubble bath while I open it. I wonder which one it is. (opens it) Oh, not another platypus. I was hoping for something more like Manny the Mongoose or something. Hey, let's see if it lays eggs. (The ""platypus toy"" kicks him.) PERRY THE PLATYPUS?!?! Say hello to my little friend! (He pushes a button on his watch, and an inator rolls in.) My new Straitjacket-inator! Ha ha! it was tailor-made just for you by my other little friend. (Whip pan to reveal a small robot.) It may be small, but it's stronger and smarter than Norm and it's so much more efficient."
2,47,Norm,847...848...
2,47,Candace,"Listen up, team, I'll be at the front of the house tracking Mom on my GPS device.  (Cut to Stacy and Jenny asleep.) Jenny, (Jenny wakes up.) you'll guard the gate. See to it that Phineas and Ferb stay in the hot zone. Stacy, (Stacy wakes up.) you make sure whatever they built stays there 'til Mom comes home. To achieve that goal, we use the following busting jargon: When Mom comes home, the cue is ""The condor is in the nest."" When the boys are in prime busting position, it's ""The peas are in the pod."" And if what they have built somehow disappears, I want you to scream, ""The banana has split!"" Got it? (Stacy and Jenny salute.) Good. Now, in the event that any of us should be captured— (alarm blares) That's the Mom Signal! Ladies, it's go time! So move it, move it, move it!"
2,47,Stacy,The pea is in the pod!
2,47,Jenny,The condor is in the nest!
2,47,Candace,"Mom! Mom! Phineas and Ferb have built outer space in our backyard! (Cut to reveal crudely drawn cardboard cutouts of Phineas and Ferb and the ""project"". Cut back to Candace to reveal ""Linda"" is just a dummy.) Nice drill, ladies. I'm-a lovin' teamwork!"
2,47,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, nice us's! When did you make those?"
2,47,Candace,"(wheeling the dummy out) Pay no attention to them, ""Mom""."
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, this new robot of mine is much more evil than Norm. Course, it can't talk, but that can be a good thing. And it even has a convenient blender attachment. (The robot's dome opens and produces a smoothie.) Next, I'm thinking of a platypus purée. (cut to Norm's room) This new model requires so little energy to run it really makes clumsy old Norm quite obsolete. (Norm peaks out from behind the door.)"
2,47,Norm,"Now I know I have a heart, because it's breaking."
2,47,Phineas,"We're ready to go. You sure you don't want one, Buford?"
2,47,Buford,"Naw, I still say it's lame."
2,47,Phineas,"Fair enough. Canopies down, everybody."
2,47,Isabella,Ready!
2,47,Baljeet,(the canopy closes on his fingers) Ah! (he reopens it and closes it properly) Ready.
2,47,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, bring out the radiant power source."
2,47,Isabella,What's that?
2,47,Phineas,"You can't plug the tops in or the cords would get all wrapped up. So we created a power source that will radiate energy across the yard to anything that needs it. (Ferb activates the power source and climbs back into his top.) Okay, everybody, now, the secret to a good top spin, if I can call it that—"
2,47,Phineas,"Ha, good one, Baljeet!"
2,47,Baljeet,This is almost as fun—
2,47,Isabella,(bumps Baljeet) I'm going for my bumper patc— (gets bumped by Ferb)
2,47,Candace,"Code red, busters! The condor is on the wing! I want feet on the ground! It's real this time!"
2,47,Stacy,Moving in! (swings down from the top of the tree)
2,47,Jenny,Rock and roll!
2,47,Buford,"Ah, still lame. (walks to the power source) Maybe I can liven things up a bit."
2,47,Stacy,What's going on?! Why are they going so fast?!
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, look at him, he's— He's positively shaking with anticipation at the thought of helping me take over the Tri-State Area. He's— (The robot suddenly begins to transform and grow.) Hoo-hoo-hoo! I-I didn't even know he could do that, whatever it is. Wow! I'm a better evil scientist than I thought!"
2,47,Robot,"Doofenshmirtz, your pathetic schemes have all failed! Step aside and let the true master take over!"
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"(gasps) He can talk! (gets blasted by the robot) And shoot, too! Ow! Save me! Save me, Perry the Platypus! AAAAAHHH!"
2,47,Robot,"Perry the Platypus, my fight is with Doofenshmirtz, not you.  (He flicks Perry off and Perry flings out of the building.)"
2,47,Major Monogram,"Agent P, an unusual power wave has struck the city with potentially disastrous consequences. Forget Doofenshmirtz, find the source of that power wave, and dismantle it."
2,47,Robot,"Prepare to meet your maker, maker! (He powers up his hand and blasts, but misses when Doof trips.)"
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror.
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,(offscreen) Mostly terror! Mostly terror!
2,47,Candace,"The condor is in the nest! Let's go, condor!"
2,47,Linda,"Candace, what is going on?"
2,47,Candace,You'll see! Just wait.
2,47,Linda,"So, I'm guessing your brothers are doing something wildly dangerous?"
2,47,Candace,Uh...
2,47,Linda,"Well, I've got a few seconds to kill before my bladder bursts like a water balloon, so let's get this over with. (walks in the direction of the backyard, but Candace stops her)"
2,47,Candace,"No! Teamwork! I mean, we've got to wait for the signal! Any second now.  Come on, girls, give me the code!"
2,47,Stacy,"Without the headsets, how can we signal Candace?!"
2,47,Jenny,I don't know!
2,47,Stacy,How can she not hear this racket?!
2,47,Linda,That's quite a racket back there. Are you sure you don't want me to take a look?
2,47,Candace,No way! Not until I get the signal.
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm! Norm, help me, I'm gonna be puréed!"
2,47,Norm,"Sorry, sir, no can do. I'm bringing coffee to the new boss."
2,47,Robot,Sounds delicious. Just a moment.
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,AAAh! I don't want to be a smoothie!
2,47,Norm,"Here you go, sir. Just the way you— (""accidentally"" throws the coffee mug) Whoopsie-daisy."
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, it's lucky for me you tripped on that rug again."
2,47,Norm,"There was no rug, sir."
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,"Awww, thank you, Norm. I shouldn't have been so hard on you, but how come you were not affected by that strange energy thingy?"
2,47,Norm,(puts Doof down) Don't you remember? I run on squirrel power! (opens his cavity to reveal a squirrel running on a wheel)
2,47,Doofenshmirtz,Wow! I should really read your operation manual.
2,47,Candace,Wait for the signal. Wait for it.
2,47,Phineas,"This is getting a little uncomfortable. Eject, everybody! (He ejects from his top.)"
2,47,Jenny,I lied about the persimmon.
2,47,Linda,"Alright, Candace, enough's enough!"
2,47,Candace,"No! (grabs her mother, on her headset) Is the pea in the pod?! Is the pea in the pod??! What's up with the pea?!?! (They finally get into the backyard.) Not again!"
2,47,Linda,"Hey, kids. So what was all the big racket back here?"
2,47,Phineas,We were just playing with our tops.
2,47,Linda,Oh.
2,47,Jenny,Phineas and Ferb...were all spinning around and around(?)
2,47,Stacy,And they were running so fast...And it flew away into the clouds!
2,47,Jenny and Stacy,Giant tops of doom!
2,47,Buford,(offscreen) LAME!
2,47,Linda,You girls are beginning to sound a lot like Candace.
2,47,Jenny,They were huge!
2,47,Stacy,And suddenly—
2,47,Candace,"Oh, will you two give it up already?"
2,47,Jenny,But you said to wait until she offers pie.
2,47,Linda,Ooh! Good idea! Who wants pie?
2,47,Jenny,(raises hand) Me!
2,47,Stacy,(raises hand) Me!
2,47,Candace,(raises hand slightly) Me.
2,47,Phineas and the Gang,Us!
2,47,Perry,(chatters)
2,47,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry! (He pets Perry and his leg kicks.)"
2,47,Stacy,Mom.
2,46,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're going to the Space Adventure film festival! It's gonna be awe-soooooommmme!!!"
2,46,Candace,"(growls, grunts) (hears Phineas continuing the music)"
2,46,Phineas,♪ It's an adventure in space! ♪
2,46,Candace,(wears headphones that make music)
2,46,Irving,"(from inside) According to my motion sensors, (cuts to him in his room at his computer, banging is heard outside) Phineas and Ferb are awake!"
2,46,Albert,"(bangs down Irving's door) What did you lock your door for, Ir-ving?"
2,46,Irving,"To keep you out, Al-bert!"
2,46,Albert,Older brothers should have 24-hour access to younger brothers' rooms. It's a good thing I used an old secret military technique I taught myself. (walks over to the computer) Who are those dorks?
2,46,Irving,Phineas and Ferb are not dorks; They are the coolest exponents of awesome stupefaction in the universe!
2,46,Albert,"Yeah. Just because you put it on... (Close up on the computer, it reads ""Phineas and Ferb FANSITE"") your fansite doesn't mean it's true. (Back to them) And could we talk about all these pictures?"
2,46,Irving,What? Too obsessive.
2,46,Albert,"Well, there is that, but I'm just saying your composition stinks. (looks at a picture) I can't even tell what this is a picture of."
2,46,Irving,(walks up) A solar-powered flock of mechanical hummingbirds. Phineas and Ferb built them.
2,46,Albert,"Yeah, right. That's a hoax!"
2,46,Irving,"How dare you! (walks to another picture) I suppose this cold-fusion powered merry-go-round they built was a hoax, too!"
2,46,Albert,"I can tell a fake a mile away, little brother. They call me: ""The Truth Detector""."
2,46,Irving,It's NOT fake!! Phineas and Ferb really build these things! A-A-And I'll prove it to you!
2,46,Albert,"Well, I have important older-brothery things to do right now. But if you give me the address, I'll meet you there at noon."
2,46,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. I've instituted a new short-order message technique. Listen carefully. (rings the bell) Doof is up, put a stop, curses on the side. Well, let's go, Agent P. My orders are backing up. Adam and Eve on a raft, rack em'."

2,46,Irving,Hmm... (calling out) Phineas?! Ferb?!
2,46,Buford,(offscreen) They went to the movies.
2,46,Baljeet,No Phineas and Ferb today.
2,46,Irving,What am I gonna do?! Albert goes back to boarding school tomorrow! He'll think I'm a liar!
2,46,Baljeet,I have an idea. (Wipe to him later on) Phineas and Ferb made me this 3D projector. I can project one of their projects right into the yard here. Your brother will think they just built it.
2,46,Irving,And it wouldn't be lying because they did actually did build it. What have you got?
2,46,Baljeet,"Well, let us see. (transitions to Eiffel Tower) Oh, this is from the time Phineas and Ferb built a full-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower. I will hide the projector in the bushes."
2,46,Irving,"But look. Albert is impossible to fool. They call him ""The Truth Detector""."
2,46,Buford,"I don't know, I'm convinced."
2,46,Irving,"Uh-oh, and he's supposed to meet Phineas and Ferb too."
2,46,Baljeet,Too bad we are not Phineas and Ferb.
2,46,Irving,(gasps) I've got a crazy idea. Time for a makeover.
2,46,Buford and Baljeet,(squeal)
2,46,Buford,"A manly one, right?"
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Full steam ahead. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo hoo! Oh, hey, there. Is that the Doofenshmirtz choo-choo? No, it's not! You will all be late for your jobs and be fired. (laughs)"
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus. Hello. Have you come to see my new hobby? Scale model reproductions of actual railroads, train depots... look, even scale model litter. Shameful. My father bought one for me when I was just a little evil, but you know, he wouldn't let me play with it."
2,46,Young Doofenshmirtz,"Father, may I play with my trains now?"
2,46,Doofenshmirtz's father,Nein!
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Now that I'm old enough to buy my own, I'm disappointed by the shabby quality of the cheap model reproductions. Which is why I'm going to travel the globe and shrink the world's greatest architectural treasures. (breaks out of Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated) Just to put them in my train set, see? The Shrink-inator ray is for the shrinking, the cardboard box is for holding the shrunken treasures, and the bicarbonate of soda is for my motion sickness. First stop: Cairo, Egypt. (laughs) Wrong way."
2,46,Baljeet,"Ah, we are ready."
2,46,Irving,"WHAT?! No! No no no, you can't BOTH be Phineas!"
2,46,Baljeet,"That is what I told him, but he would not listen."
2,46,Buford,Phineas gets all the lines!
2,46,Albert,"Irving, are you here?"
2,46,Irving,"(gasps) He's here! Quick, put these on."
2,46,Albert,"Irving! Irving, I thought you were pulling my leg, but this is remarkable."
2,46,Irving,"Really, you're buying it?"
2,46,Albert,What?
2,46,Irving,Nothing.
2,46,Albert,"So, when am I gonna meet this Phineas and Ferb?"
2,46,Irving,"Oh, well, what do you know, they are here now."
2,46,Baljeet,"(as Phineas) Hello, I think you know what we are doing today."
2,46,Buford,"(as Ferb) 'Ello, I'm from England and I don't talk much."
2,46,Irving,"Phineas, Ferb, this is my older brother Albert. Albert, meet Phineas and Ferb."
2,46,Albert,"Hmm. Remember earlier when I accused you of pulling the wool over my eyes? Well, I take it back. It's a real pleasure to meet you boys."
2,46,Irving,What?
2,46,Albert,"So, tell me about this Eiffel Tower."
2,46,Baljeet,"(as Phineas) Um, it is big."
2,46,Buford,And Mexican.
2,46,Albert,I thought it was French. What do you know. Learn something new every day.
2,46,Irving,Are you serious?
2,46,Albert,I would be honored to watch the great Phineas and Ferb at work. Would you mind building something?
2,46,Baljeet,(as Phineas) Sure.
2,46,Irving,No! I mean... I know they would love to. Albert?
2,46,Albert,"Shh, they're working."
2,46,Isabella,"Hi Phineas. Hi... Ferb? Okay, what'cha doin'?"
2,46,Irving,(whispers to Isabella)
2,46,Isabella,"Oh, okay. What'cha doin'?"
2,46,Albert,They're building something live. In person.
2,46,Baljeet,(as Phineas) Nice.
2,46,Albert,The simplicity of the design enhances its innovation.
2,46,Irving,Really? The simplicity of the design? Okay.
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"First stop on our shopping spree. You know, I've always dug the Sphinx. I mean, what is it? A man? A cat? A cat-man? It doesn't matter. And gotcha. Now I switch on my Shrink-inator ray and... it's mine now. There you are. Perfect. Look at-- look at the detail. Well, you know the saying: ""Honk if you love evil""! (laughs, flies off)"
2,46,Candace,"Oooooh, what are those two up to now? (Cuts to her perspective out the window.) Okay, Phineas and Ferb are standing in the yard with two nerds, Isabella, and the Eiffel Tower. (Cut back to her.) That's nothing but trouble! Wait a sec... (She gets out binoculars, cut to her view from them.) Those aren't my brothers. (Zoom in on Buford and Baljeet) What?! Is that Buford and Baljeet?! (Cut back to her, she gets out her phone and dials it.) Oh, I am so calling Mom! (Stops) Hold on. If those aren't my brothers, why am I calling my mom? Why not call Buford and Baljeet's moms? That satisfies the Mom response, and the bust urge! I'll call that dork Irving's mom, too. And what the heck? Why leave my mom out of the party? (She laughs, plays another song on her headphones and dials numbers, humming.) Information, please. (Hums more.)"
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, so we have the Great Wall of China, oh, excuse me, I mean the Great Small of China, and the, uh-- The Shrinx (Sphinx), and the Teeny Tower of Pisa (Leaning Tower of Pisa), and the Roman Coliseum-- The Coliseum-- Coli-- I have to think about that one. No matter. Because last but not least, the Taj Ma-Small (Taj Mahal). Ha-ha, oh, that's a good one. Back to the Tri-State Area and let the fun begin."
2,46,Albert,You guys are amazing. What else can you do?
2,46,Buford,"(as Ferb) Um, I can turn my head completely around."
2,46,Albert,Wow. I wish I was that double-jointed.
2,46,Irving,Really?
2,46,Albert,"Really. Well, it's been a real pleasure and an honor to meet you guys. Come on, Irving, let's go."
2,46,Buford,I can't believe we tricked the un-trickable.
2,46,Irving,"I am at a loss for words, dude."
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, let's see, the uh-- the Roman Coliseum. The, uh, No-Man-Can-See-'Em-Because-It's-So-Tiny. No, that's not a good-- (Perry hits him) Ah!"
2,46,Albert,"That was really, really amazing."
2,46,Irving,"Oh, really?"
2,46,Irving,"So your super-senses weren't tingling when, oh, I don't know, Ferb had eyes in his mouth?! Didn't that give you a moment of pause?! A scintilla of doubt?!"
2,46,Albert,What are you talking about?
2,46,Irving,I can't believe how gullible you are. That wasn't the real Phineas and Ferb.
2,46,Albert,"Well, of course it was. I saw their pictures on your wall."
2,46,Irving,"That was two kids in costume and that Eiffel Tower was a hologram, Mr. ""Ta-Ruth Detector""."
2,46,Albert,"Sorry, little bro. There was no way that was a hologram."
2,46,Irving,"Oh, yeah? Well, let's go back and I'll show you."
2,46,Albert,"Yeah, let's do that."
2,46,Baljeet,"What did you think, Isabella? Was I a convincing Phineas?"
2,46,Isabella,No. No you weren't.
2,46,Buford,"Yeah, but totally nailed Ferb."
2,46,Baljeet,"Oh, I almost forgot."
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, w-w-what are you doing with that? Oh, no, my-my Eiffel Tower! Gotcha. Uh, hey, Perry the Platypus, I saved the Trifle Tower. (Eiffel Tower) No, Perry the Platypus, don't zap it again. It will make it grow. (cries out) Oh, no, I'm shrunk."
2,46,Baljeet,What was that?
2,46,Buford,"I think it was my stomach. I told you, I'm starving."
2,46,Irving,"See it and believe it, brother. See-- I can run right through-- (bangs into the tower) it. But it was-- but I had you."
2,46,Albert,"Consider this a lesson learned, Irving."
2,46,Irving,(cries out)
2,46,Albert,(drags Irving away) No one pulls the wool over the eyes of The Truth Detector!
2,46,Baljeet's mom,"Hello, Linda."
2,46,Linda,"Hi, ladies."
2,46,Baljeet's mom,I got a call from Candace...
2,46,Buford's mom,...Who said something about our sons and busting!
2,46,Irving's mom,(Walks up) Are Irving and Albert okay?
2,46,Candace,"(Walking out the front door) Hello, ladies! (Runs up to them, pushes Linda) Come on, come on, moms! (She drags Biffany offscreen, Mrs. Tjinder and Mrs. Du Bois follow.) I can't wait to see the looks on your faces when you see the spectacle that's in the backyard, come on!"
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"All right, put up your dukes! Wait-- Wait-- what are you doing?! (Perry puts him in his hat.) Hey, this place is nicer than my first apartment."
2,46,Phineas,"♪ Space Adventure, an adventure in... ♪ Know what, Ferb?"
2,46,Ferb,We're over it.
2,46,Phineas,Yes. Yes we are.
2,46,Candace,"Come on, moms! (Enters backyard) A-ha! (Pause, Linda and the other moms come by in the background.) Huh?!"
2,46,Phineas,"Hey Candace, you built this? Nice to see you're starting to take an interest."
2,46,Candace,"What?!! No-no-no-no-no, where's the Eiffel Tower? (runs up to them and feels around) Oh, wait. I've seen this, it's invisible! I've just got to find it! (Cuts to a bored Linda and the surprised mothers, she continues offscreen.) It has to be around here somewhere!"
2,46,Lawrence,"(walks up) ♪ Space Adventure. ♪ So, what did I miss?"
2,46,Candace,"(offscreen) And look! (Runs up) Here are Buford and Baljeet, your sons being bad! (Stretches Ferb's head) They're in disguises! Uh, really good disguises! (Grunts while stretching Phineas' head, chuckles deadpanned) It'll come off in a second."
2,46,Baljeet's mom,Does this happen often?
2,46,Linda,"(With disdain) Yes, yes it does. Welcome to my world. How about a cup of tea? (She walks offscreen, Lawrence and the moms follow her.)"
2,46,Buford's mom,I hope you got cookies!
2,46,Linda,"(offscreen) Of course, Biffany."
2,46,Doofenshmirtz,"So, let me guess, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes, we're going to return everything I shrank, right? Huh, even the Roman Small-iseum? Hey, look, I finally figured that one out, huh? Ow! Oh, curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
2,52,Phineas,"Well Ferb, after that long, winded argument of yours, I agree. (shows blueprint) We'll build a Monorail to Mars! (Candace walks by) Now all we need is 36 million miles of steel--"
2,52,Candace,"What is wrong with you two? Can't you think of something normal to do like making a lemonade stand or picking your nose or something? (Ferb pulls out device) That better not be a nose picking machine! (Ferb puts it down) Yeah, that's right."
2,52,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,52,Major Monogram,"Agent P, I'm glad you're here. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been hoarding all of the paper in the Tri-State Area. Find out what he's got up his sleeve, other than, apparently, an enormous amount of paper. Good luck, Agent P.(Perry salutes and leaves.)"
2,52,Candace,(opens the door without even looking at Stacy) So you boys just try and pull one over on me...
2,52,Stacy,"Hey, Candace!"
2,52,Candace,"'Cause I'm gonna be on you all day like... like a book on a shelf! No, that's stupid."
2,52,Stacy,Candace?
2,52,Candace,"Like a beard on a face! Ew! No, no, no."
2,52,Stacy,Candace?
2,52,Candace,Like a light switch on a wall! That's on! Like I am! On you!
2,52,Stacy,CANDACE!! Ready to go to the mall?
2,52,Candace,"The mall? Uh, uh..."
2,52,Phineas,"Don't mind us, ladies. We're just sitting here making every day of summer count."
2,52,Candace,"You know, I can't really leave right now, I mean, clearly, I'm gonna have some serious busting to do around here, and you understand, don't you?"
2,52,Stacy,"(Glares) No, I don't understand! We've been planning this for like three weeks! It's like four months in teenager years!"
2,52,Candace,They're using protractors!
2,52,Stacy,"Candace, I am tired of taking the backseat to the totally unlikely chance that you will bust your brothers. I want a best friend I can count on. So, you're gonna have to choose: It's me, or busting."
2,52,Candace,You're making me choose? You wouldn't dare.
2,52,Stacy,Yu-huh!
2,52,Candace,Yu-nothing! A real best friend would never do that to me!
2,52,Stacy,A real best friend wouldn't make me do that to her.
2,52,Candace,"Then, I guess you're not my best friend."
2,52,Stacy,Not anymore. (leaves)
2,52,Candace,Fine!
2,52,Stacy,Fine!
2,52,Candace,Fine!
2,52,Stacy,Fine!
2,52,Candace,FINE!
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Finally! The plumber. The garbage disposal is stuck again. The same one you fixed last week, by the way! And while you're at it--(exclaims) Oh, who needs to see that?! Yeesh! Oh, I'll be in the other room. I mean, oh, for crying out loud--(Perry gives him the bill) What, you're done already? You've only been here for, like 15 seconds. And I was talking for, like half of that. What kind of a plumber are you?"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,A platypus plumber?
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,Perry the platypus plumber?
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus?! (traps Perry in a roll of toilet paper) Ha ha, ha ha ha! Amazing what you can do with toilet paper! Which you would know, if you were a real plumber. In fact, it's amazing what you can do with all kinds of paper! (showing several stacks of paper in the background) And no, I'm not a hoarder."
2,52,Candace,Gotcha! It's a good thing I threw away a lifelong friendship to keep an eye on you two and your ridiculous...uhhh???
2,52,Phineas,"Lemonade stand. We liked your idea so much, we decided to go for it. And it's turning out to be a big hit."
2,52,Balthazar,Wow! This is the best lemonade I've ever had! Hit me again! (Ferb pours him some more lemonade)
2,52,Candace,"A regular old lemonade stand? That's it? Huh. That means there's, uh, nothing for me to bust today, which means...I have a free day! Phineas and Ferb, I've got to hand it to you. Finally, I can like normal mediocre kids doing normal mediocre stuff. Thanks for giving me the day off!"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that's a lot of paper. Would you like to know what I'm going to do with it all? Well, I'll tell you. (retracts a screen in front of Perry and the show begins)"
2,52,Man,"Birth of an inator! The wheel, the light bulb, the frozen pop with two sticks, so you can give half to a friend. All profound inventions in their time, but they fail in comparison to the Paper-Cut-Inator (shows a picture of a machine with a cannon with claws around it)...(???) of the world-renowned evil genius Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz!"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,I was sick that day!
2,52,Man,"This new and exciting inator turns any kind of paper, into razor sharp slicing missiles (pronounced as Mis-eye-lles) and hurls them toward an unsuspecting tri-state-area...watch out Danville!!"
2,52,Second man,Ouch! Something bit me!
2,52,Man,"That something is evil science, tiger! Good thing the local pharmacy is fully stocked with new Doofenshmirtz Brand Adhesive bandages (shows a bandaid with the sick Doofenshmirtz face as the logo). They are terrific and expensive! And brought to you by Danville's newest soon-to be trillionaire, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. (the picture is seen again) Thanks, Heinz!"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, that picture's gonna haunt me."
2,52,Man,And happy evil!
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"(video off) Not bad, huh? I'm gonna do all of my Inator introductions like that from now on! It just so much more professional looking!"
2,52,Candace,"I'm going to the mall! I'll call Stacy. No, wait. Stacy's mad at me. And I'm mad at Stacy! But I can't go by myself. I'll look like a total dork. Okay, I'll just get a new best friend!"
2,52,Jenny,"Hey, Candace."
2,52,Candace,"Hey there, Jenny. As of no doubt you heard, Stacy has elected not to renew her option on being my best friend. So, as someone who has expressed interest in the past, I thought you might want to bail yourself of this exciting opportunity."
2,52,Jenny,"Come on, Candace. You just want someone to go to the mall with you."
2,52,Candace,Will you go?
2,52,Jenny,"Sorry, but I can't. I've got to get to the save the pigeons rally. Save the pigeons!"
2,52,Candace,"Okay, got to cast that net a little wider. (going through list of names in phone) Jeremy? No, I can't talk about Jeremy with Jeremy. Mad at Stacy. Jenny, pigeons. Mom? No way! Yuck! How did HE even get in here?! Delete! Okay, who next? (more rapidly at each turn) Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. (gasps) How can I only have four friends?! And one of them's my mom!"
2,52,Girl 1,"Hey, best friend!"
2,52,Candace,Huh?
2,52,Girl 1,I've been looking everywhere for you!
2,52,Candace,"Oh, my gosh, I don't know you, but okay!"
2,52,Girl 1,Come here. Let's go to the mall.
2,52,Girl 2,"Hey, did you see that lonely girl?"
2,52,Girl 1,"Yeah, she was all by herself and singular."
2,52,Phineas,"(as the customers clamor) I'm glad people are enjoying their lemonade, but it's getting really hard to keep up. We better check in with Isabella. Isabella, how is phase two coming along?"
2,52,Isabella,"Hold on, Phineas! (at the Fireside Girls) A little more to my left. (at Phineas) Franchise locations are a go."
2,52,Phineas,"Easy, folks. Relief is on the way."
2,52,Adyson,Here you go.
2,52,Ballpit Kid,"Hey, everyone! It says there's a new Phineas and Ferb lemonade stand opening with no wait!"
2,52,Lemonade man,"They have a lemonade stand inside the grocery store, the bookstore, and the mall. It's even being served on my favorite airline! (rips shirt to reveal his chest tattoo of the P&F lemonade corporation; and puts on lemonade-shaped hat) YEAH! OH, YEAH! LEMONADE! IN YOUR FACE, ORANGE JUICE! BOO-YAH! THAT'S RIGHT, BOO! YAH! LEMONADE!"
2,52,Phineas,"Okay, no more for that guy."
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,Let me show you my Paper Cut-inator in action!
2,52,Candace,Wow! Finding a new best friend is even harder than I thought! Makes me kinda miss Stacy! Why did I let our friendship go?
2,52,(Song,"""You're My Better Best Friend"")"
2,52,Buford,"So you lost your best friend, huh? Yeah, I know how you feel. I lost my best friend once. Little guy, all yellow-y and scaly. His name was Biff, turned into this whole brouhaha. I had to fight a squid."
2,52,Candace,"Wait a min--wait a minute, what you're trying to say is that if Stacy is really my best friend, I should just apologize to her. And if I'm really Stacy's best friend, she'll take me back! (runs off)"
2,52,Buford,"Oh, sure! It's all about you!"
2,52,Candace,"It's not too late to fix this! I can still have a best friend forever! Stacy, there she is! Right next to the Phineas... and Ferb... Lemonade stand. (looks at the cup she has been drinking from, realizing she has been drinking from Phineas and Ferb Lemonade, followed by several of the P&F lemonade franchises, until finally stopping at a beauty salon where some one is doing Linda's hair) Mom! I'll tell mom! But wait! Stacy! Mom! Stacy! Mom! Stacy! Mom! Stacy! Stom! Macy! Seven! Wolverine! Shish kebab! Marmalade! Hominahaa... (mutters indistinctly)"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, it's almost warmed up. Are you watching Perry the-- What? What the...?"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,How did you get out of that!? It's two ply!
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Ow! Spitballs? Oh, I get it. Paper fight! (makes a figure used in paper football and throws it at Perry who ducks and raises two arms as the paper football flies between his arms) GOAL!!!"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"I am NOT in love with Sophie! I am not! Oh, you're gonna get it now, Perry the Platypus! (puts on paper hat) Boom! (no effect) Well, that doesn't do much. I'm gonna get you with the Paper-Cut-inator! (trips) Flypaper? Well, it doesn't matter! Look!"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,One piece? That's it?
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"A plunger jam?! Ah, I hate those! They always make the Paper-Cut-Inator-- (Hundreds of paper slices fly around Doofenshmirtz injuring him all around) EEEEEEE-Explode! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
2,52,Lemonade-Making Machine,"(squeezes lemons which squirt in the paper cut) LEMON JUICE! (It malfunctions, causing all P&F lemonade stands to go out of business)"
2,52,Phineas,"Sorry, folks, we're sold out!"
2,52,Buford,"Go home, you losers, we're dry!"
2,52,Crowd,(groaning in disappointment)
2,52,Buford,Biff (sobbing)
2,52,Linda,"Hey, Candace, isn't that Stacy over there? Hi, Stacy."
2,52,Stacy,(looks at Candace)
2,52,Linda,"You okay, honey?"
2,52,Bus driver,"Come on, kid. I'm on a schedule."
2,52,Candace,(looks at the lemonade stands)
2,52,Bus driver,"Come on, kid. In, or out?"
2,52,Linda,Candace?
2,52,Candace,"Mom, there's something I got to tell you."
2,52,Linda,"What is it, honey?"
2,52,Candace,"That if you want me, I'll be at the mall with Stacy."
2,52,Linda,Um...okay.
2,52,Stacy,"(as she and Candace board the bus) Welcome back, best friend."
2,52,Candace,"Thanks, best friend."
2,52,Stacy,I have had my eye on the cutest pink dress for you.
2,52,Linda,"Aww. It's nice to see Candace enjoying herself for a change. Now, where are those lemonade stands I keep hearing about?"
2,52,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, I think it's time to shut her down."
2,52,Ferb,(claps twice)
2,52,Linda,"Hi, boys. So, what did you two do today?"
2,52,Ferb,"Just normal, mediocre kid stuff."
2,52,Linda,Sounds great.
2,52,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,52,Vanessa,"Hey, Dad! I just got some great lemonade from the new stand down the street. It's really sour. Do you want to--(slips on some paper; exclaims)"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,(screaming)
2,52,Vanessa,"Uh, Dad? You know he's not here, right?"
2,52,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, I know, but I'm sure it's his fault."
2,52,(Song,"""You're My Better Best Friend"")"
2,52,Buford,"So you lost your best friend, huh? Yeah, I know how you feel. I lost my best friend once. Little guy, all yellow-y and scaly. His name was Biff, turned into this whole brouhaha. I had to fight a squid."
2,56,Linda,"(from inside) Enough moping around, Candace. (cut to inside Candace's room where Candace is sitting on her bed, she approaches her.) Phineas and Ferb said they've devised a fun way to wash the house. Why don't you join them? Have some fun for a change!"
2,56,Candace,For a change? I have lots of fun!
2,56,Linda,"You mean, obsessively trying to bust your brothers for their mystery crimes? Is that ""fun""?"
2,56,Candace,I have fun. I'm like the queen of fun! I have fun all day!
2,56,Linda,"I can tell. Well, if you just sit inside today, you should at least do a little reading."
2,56,Candace,"Aw, Mom?"
2,56,Linda,It's one of my favorites.
2,56,Candace,The Wizard of Oz. Isn't this for babies?
2,56,Linda,Or you could wipe down Perry's platypus plaza play set.
2,56,Candace,"(Opens book) I'm reading, I'm reading!"
2,56,Linda,"Well, I'll be at my weight lifting class. Have fun!"
2,56,Candace,"Ah! Oh, my eyes hurt! (to a picture of Jeremy) Oh, Jeremy, you're the only one who understands-"
2,56,Buford,"Hi, Candace!"
2,56,Candace,"AHH! Buford, Baljeet, what do you two want?"
2,56,Buford,"What, like in a metaphysical sense? Nothing. I'm good."
2,56,Baljeet,I want to be cool!
2,56,Buford,That's not gonna happen.
2,56,Baljeet,Oh....
2,56,Candace,"I mean, why are you looking in my window, duh!"
2,56,Buford,"Oh, Ferb says I should tell you we're about to start washing the house, and you can help us out if you want!"
2,56,Candace,Not likely.
2,56,Buford,"Either way, you might want to put on some waterproof undergarments."
2,56,Candace,Will you get out of here?!?
2,56,Candace,"(opens book again) Blah blah Dorothy, blah blah Kansas. There's a cyclone coming?"

2,42,Candace,What are you guys doing?
2,42,Phineas,"Well, right now we're just thinking about defying gravity."
2,42,Candace,"Please, even you can't change the law of gravity. It's a universal law, like ""You can't wear white after Labor Day""."
2,42,Phineas,"An absolute law without a hope of appeal? That's despotism! Somebody oughta- Hey, that's it! I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry?"
2,42,Candace,Right here.
2,42,Phineas,"Oh, I didn't see him there."
2,42,Major Monogram,Carl...
2,42,Carl,"One minute, sir! Just finishing my status update. ""Carl's interning like there's no tomorrow!"" Done."
2,42,Major Monogram,"Carl, I just completed your intern evaluation report. You've earned a gold star in every category except one. You need to show more initiative."
2,42,Carl,"Sir, I've never gotten less than a gold star in my whole interning life."
2,42,Major Monogram,"Well, I do have 24 hours before I have to submit my evaluation. Prove that you can show initiative and that gold star is yours."
2,42,Carl,I'll start right now by triple-checking the chattosphere for suspicious activities.
2,42,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. Nice job on the blueprint for our Anti-Gravity Fun Launcher. I just posted it on our website so Baljeet can check the math. (phone rings) Hey, Baljeet, that was fast."
2,42,Baljeet,Your blueprints are 97% accurate. But you accidentally placed a cosine where you needed a quadratic differential! (laughs) Not to worry. I fixed it. I will send an attachment.
2,42,Phineas,Excellent.
2,42,(cut to,)
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,There's absolutely nothing going on today.
2,42,Norm,Have you finished that puzzle yet?
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"No, I lost the stupid box lid. Now I can't figure out how to solve it."
2,42,Norm,Then you could finish building me a bride out of icicle-pop sticks like you promised.
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"I'd like to help you out, Norm. Really. But look at my tongue. (his tongue is blue) See? Look at that. My doctor said no more blue raspberry icicle-pops until the blue dye flushes completely out of my system."
2,42,Norm,Why must I be alone?
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"I don't know. Why are raspberry icicle-pops blue? (Norm kisses the icicle-pop stick bride) And I know what you are doing, Norm! You're a sick, sick robot! I need a really evil scheme. But-- Oh, it's so hard to create when I'm in one of my moods. (uses computer) Maybe I can borrow someone else's plans from the Internet. (types; sees blueprints) Blueprints, and...search. Ooh, an Anti-Gravity Fun Launcher! How about the Anti-Gravity Evil Launch-inator? There. I changed the name, that makes it mine. This could be the greatest scheme ever!"
2,42,Carl,"(gasps) Doofenshmirtz just downloaded a blueprint. (reads the blueprint) ""Anti-gravity fun launcher""? Sounds fishy. Let's run it through the anagram decoder. (sees the words ""Evil Fanatic Hunt R Raygun"" on the screen; gasps) Major Monogram!"
2,42,Major Monogram,You don't have to yell. I'm right here.
2,42,Carl,"Doofenshmirtz just downloaded these plans for an anti-gravity fun launcher. But when I run that through the anagram decoder, the letters form ""Evil Fanatic Hunt R Raygun""."
2,42,Major Monogram,Looks like you're missing an E.
2,42,Carl,They're probably just trying to mislead us. Let's check the source. (looks at the Flynn-Fletcher file) Agent P's owners! They must be in league with Doofenshmirtz.
2,42,Major Monogram,"I don't know, Carl. Sounds a little far-fetched."
2,42,Carl,"But wait, listen to this. It's a seemingly innocent voice recording of Phineas. (plays the voice recording)"
2,42,Phineas,"(voice recording) Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today."
2,42,Carl,"But if we play all those syllables backwards in a random order, we get..."
2,42,Phineas,(voice recording) Let's help Doofenshmirtz d-destroy the Tri-State Area.
2,42,Major Monogram,Keep a close eye on those boys. See what else you can find out.
2,42,Major Monogram,"Agent P, we need you to track down a missing agent. Code name: Agent G. We're not sure of his current location, but we have a few leads placing him in Iceland, Monte Carlo, Burbank, California, and the moon. It's up to you to chase that goose and bring him back to the agency. Good luck, Agent P. Monogram out."
2,42,Carl,"So, who is Agent G again?"
2,42,Major Monogram,"Garry the Gander? Oh, that's just a wild-goose chase. Get it? Goose, gander? Heh. Uh, we had to distract Agent P because he's too close to Phineas and Ferb."
2,42,Carl,Then who will investigate the boys?
2,42,Major Monogram,"Hm, we need to send someone in undercover. All the agents are out on their missions. (upbeat theme plays)"
2,42,Carl,(squeals)
2,42,(Song,"Carl, Incognito)"
2,42,Major Monogram,"Good luck, Agent Carl."
2,42,Carl,"You can count on me, sir."
2,42,Phineas,Okay. Now where's Perry?
2,42,Phineas,"All right, guys, chop-chop. Time to prove Sir Isaac Newton wrong."
2,42,Carl,"Sir, I've reached the target. Over."
2,42,Monogram,"Roger that, Carl. Now observe, then infiltrate."
2,42,Isabella,"Who's that, Phineas?"
2,42,Phineas,"Oh, hey, kid. You wanna help?"
2,42,Carl,"(to Phineas) Me? Sure. (to Monogram) Sir, I've made contact."
2,42,Phineas,"Hey, thanks. What's your name?"
2,42,Carl,"Uh... (thinking) Say a cool name like Nitro, Dax or Steel. (to Phineas) My name is Carl. (groans)"
2,42,Phineas,"Nice to meet you, Carl. Come and join us in the fun."
2,42,Carl,"(to Monogram) Sir, I've gained their trust. (to Phineas) So, what kind of scheme is this?"
2,42,Phineas,We're just having fun challenging universal laws.
2,42,Carl,"(to Baljeet) So, I hear you're the math genius behind this operation."
2,42,Baljeet,"Oh, no, no, no. Phineas and Ferb's blueprint was already brilliant. I just made a minor modification."
2,42,Carl,"Interesting. (to Ferb) So, Ferb, you don't talk much, do you?"
2,42,Ferb,"Actually, I--"
2,42,Carl,"Oh, what's that over there?"
2,42,Phineas,"Nice job, everyone. It came out perfectly. Who wants to go first?"
2,42,Isabella,I think our guest should go first.
2,42,Carl,"Ah, uh, me? (muttering; walks into the Anti Gravity Fun-Launcher)"
2,42,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull."
2,42,Carl,(gets hit with Anti Gravity) Ah! What's happening?
2,42,Phineas,"Don't worry. It only lasts fifteen minutes. Looks fun though, doesn't it? Let's all go."
2,42,"Isabella, Baljeet, Carl, and Phineas",(cheering and laughing)
2,42,Phineas,Coming through.
2,42,Carl,"So, what exactly is the evil purpose in all of this?"
2,42,Phineas,Evil? This is just for fun.
2,42,Carl,"Hey, guys, wait for me."

2,42,Major Monogram,"Hello, children. Carl, uh, your mother and I were worried when you didn't come home. Uh, are you in trouble?"
2,42,Carl,"No, Maj-- Er, Dad. I was just playing with my new friends. Sir, situation neutralized."
2,42,Major Monogram,"Abort mission. (over radio) I repeat, abort mission."

2,42,Carl,"Aw, come on, Dad, can't I just stay for five more minutes?"
2,42,Major Monogram,"No, no, we have to go. Your, uh, mom is making dinner."
2,42,Phineas,"See you later, Carl. It was a lot of fun. Nice kid. Last one in has to clean up."
2,42,All,(cheering)
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Stop! (panting) Hm. That's an interesting shape. It looks famil-- (steps on a soda can) Aah! (sighs; sees the ""Anti-Gravity Fun-Launcher / Anti-Gravity Evil-Launch-Inator) Wait. An anti-gravity evil launch-inator. I found another one. Heh. What are the odds? (turns on his phone) Norm, get down here. I need help."
2,42,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"Our next guest is a covert secret agent. We've pixilated his face to conceal his identity. (to Perry) Now, I understand that you're searching for a long-lost colleague. (sees Perry's picture) Oh, you brought a picture. Now, viewers, if you see this agent, call in immediately."
2,42,Gordon Gutsofanemu,"Well, I guess he found him. Hey, buddy, you forgot your pixilation!"
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Norm, you're spectacular. I never knew you could do that."
2,42,Norm,Did you know I could also do this?: (turns into a vehicle)
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,Really? Wow. I should really read your instruction book.
2,42,Norm,"Yes, yes you should."
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,(drives into the Norm Truck)
2,42,Candace,(in the car with Linda) It's about thirty feet tall with electrodes and stuff!

2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, you'll have your icicle-pop stick bride."
2,42,Norm,Yay.
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,Uh-oh.
2,42,Police officer,You got a license to drive a robot with more than two axles?
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, um, uh..."
2,42,Police officer,"That's what I thought. Okay, Charley, pull her up."
2,42,Doofenshmirtz,"Curse you, motor vehicle code! (he gets towed away)"
2,42,Major Monogram,"I'm very proud of you, Carl. But my feelings for you can be better expressed in your evaluation."
2,42,Carl,All gold stars!
2,42,Major Monogram,"Oh, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the wild-goose chase. You were just too close to this case. But don't feel bad. No one could ever find Agent G. He's been missing for far, far too long. (Perry pulls out Agent G) What the--? Agent G. On an extremely extended vacation, hm? Well, Agent P deserves a vacation more than you do. He deserves one, but unfortunately, evil never rests. So, we'll see you tomorrow. Well, this is getting a little awkward. Carl, my arm's getting tired and he won't salute back."
2,43,Phineas,"Ah, here's the doo-hickey that fuses with your spinal cord."
2,43,Isabella,Hey guys. What'cha doooin'?
2,43,Phineas,"Today, we're gonna fuse our nervous systems with Dad's laptop and surf the web using only our cerebral cortexes."
2,43,Baljeet,Wow! Surely that would be quite an exciting project.
2,43,Phineas,"Oh, hey Baljeet. Why are you dressed like a vegetable samosa?"
2,43,Baljeet,"Because today is the Tri-State Area Unification Day! I learned all about it in Assimilation class. You see, the Tri-State Area was the bi-state area until our founder, the great John P. Tristate, uttered the immortal words:"
2,43,John P. Tristate,"The, uh, bi-state area should be united with that adjacent area right over there."
2,43,Phineas,But we knew that. I was just wondering why you're dressed like a vegetable samosa.
2,43,Baljeet,"Oh, that. My Uncle Kamal is doing an exotic cuisine float in the parade, and I'm the..."
2,43,Phineas and Baljeet,Vegetable samosa!
2,43,Buford,Hey!
2,43,Baljeet,Buford?
2,43,Buford,I thought I was supposed to be the vegetable samosa!
2,43,Baljeet,Why can we not both be vegetable samosas?
2,43,Buford,"Oh, sure, two vegetable samosas! Why don't we all just dress like vegetable samosas? In fact, why don't we just all dress like mashed potatoes and take the word exotic right off the sign?!"
2,43,Baljeet,"Buford, wait!"
2,43,Buford,"No, man. It's over! I'm gonna go find another nerd!"
2,43,Baljeet,But what about the Tri-State Area Unification Day parade?
2,43,Buford,What? Is that what this parade is for?
2,43,Baljeet,Does no one know what today is?
2,43,Buford,"Well, excuse me, but that adjacent area was founded by my great-uncle Otto H. Adjacent! He didn't wanna be no part of no Tri-State Area unification, and neither do I! The blood of Otto H. Adjacent runs through these veins, and blood is thicker than water! (leaves)"
2,43,Baljeet,"Well, mango chutney is thicker than blood."
2,43,Buford,(Yelling) You're dead to me!
2,43,Phineas,"(to Ferb) Parade? I love parades. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today instead! We're gonna... Hey, where's Perry?"
2,43,Major Monogram,"Ah, there you are, Agent P. Well, let's get down to brass tacks... (reading his clipboard) What's this? ""Happy passive-agressive relationship day""? Oh, is that today?"
2,43,Carl,"That's okay, you probably weren't gonna get me anything, anyway."
2,43,Monogram,"Weel, I completely forgot."
2,43,Carl,"No, no, you know I didn't even want a present."
2,43,Monogram,"Anyway... Where were we? For some reason Doofenshmirtz has purchased a tow truck. Which isn't evil in itself, but he may be planning on towing something evil, so, check it out."
2,43,Linda,Candace? Are you ready for our girl's day out?
2,43,Candace,Just a sec mom! (She goes outside) Aha! Wait a minute. Are you guys just out here arranging kiddie wagons?
2,43,Phineas,At the moment.
2,43,Candace,"Hmm, carry on. (Candace gets into the car with Linda) All clear, luckily the boys aren't up to anything."
2,43,Phineas,A little to the left. There you go.
2,43,Linda,"Candace, you have to promise me that you won't obsess about Phineas and Ferb."
2,43,Candace,"Yeah, sure Mom, I promise."
2,43,Linda,"Don't just promise this time. Rise your right hand. Do you Candace Gertrude Flynn, solemnly swear not to obsess about your brothers, or you'll suffer the pharaoh's curse?"
2,43,Candace,The pharaoh's curse?
2,43,Linda,Yes or No?
2,43,Candace,"Okay, yes."
2,43,Linda,"Okay, now we can ave fun."
2,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? (Doofenshmmirtz activates a trap, trapping perry in a door) Hahaha! You like that? I call it my ""Indoors-inator"". I got the idea from the Perry-shaped hole you left in my wall, and in my bathroom door, a-and in my fridge. Man you were hungry that day. Anyway, here's my evil plan. (He reveals his new -inatr) Ta-da! I'm calling it the ""Duplic-8-inator"". Get it? Duplic-, then the number ""8"", then -inator. I'll bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Here I'll show you."
2,43,Farmer's Wife,"I can't believe you started a monkey basketball team, and you've only got one monkey."
2,43,Farmer's Wife,"Oh great, now three of them are going to have to sit on the bench."
2,43,Doofenshmirtz,"See? It duplicates everything eight times. When I zap those streets there will be eight time the traffic, and Danville will come to a standstill! That's where I will make off like a bandit. You see I bought this tow-truck off the internet, I'm going to call it the ""Tow-inator"" or something. And open a service, and then I'll go and... 'Course it'll be hard for me to drive anywhere, with all that traffic. T-that's a bridge I'll cross when I get there."
2,43,Nerd,(From atop a building) I've never been bullied into stopping a parade before. What should I do?
2,43,Buford,(Sighing) I don't know if this is working out. Can you talk in a Indian accent?
2,43,Nerd,"Indian accent? No. I can do an English accent, instead! (Speaking with an English accent) Hello gov'! Top of the mornin', toodle pip! Last night Mr. Governor, my toilet was broken in two."
2,43,Buford,(He sighs) Actually that was pretty good.
2,43,Phineas,"Okay everyone, let's show everybody what Tri-State unification is all about. Cue Love Händel!"
2,43,(Song,"""Tri-State Area Unification Day"")"
2,43,Phineas,"Ferb, water hazard ahead. Commence operation: unforeseen circumstance."
2,43,Buford,"Ahh, nugget!"
2,43,Nerd,(Speaking with an Italian accent) That's a too bad. Maybe you should a dress like a policeman and a re-reoute a the parade.
2,43,Buford,"(After a slight pause) If that wasn't such a good idea, I'd flatten you."
2,43,Nerd,Momma mia. That was a close.
2,43,Linda,See Candace? Isn't this nice just to get away and enjoy a day together?
2,43,Candace,"You're right Mom, this is the best. I'm not even going to think about– Mm, you know. I'm not even going to say their names."
2,43,Linda,That's the spirit.
2,43,Candace,"I'm just going to sit here and enjoy, Ooh, the parade coming by. Haha, look at that kid in the cute little car. (She notices that the kid is Phineas) Gah! (Candace slaps both hands over her mouth) Mom! Ah! What am I doing? I am blocking my view. What my brothers do doesn't affect me. Letting it go for just one day. (She takes a breath) Nails. Happy relaxing fun."
2,43,Linda,"You say something, honey?"
2,43,Buford,"Now they're headin' for the junkyard. Removes gravitational pull, it'll be impossible to escape. Am I thinkin' of a junkyard, or something else?"
2,43,Phineas,Ferb treacherous terrain coming up. Execute operation: Thing in our way.
2,43,Buford,(Watching) AHHHH! Otto H. Adjacent will be avenged!
2,43,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, which button was it? Because one of these buttons just makes it fire will-nilly all over the place. And, I don't want to hit that one by mistake. (Perry uses his tail to knock on the door that is holding him) Oop, someone's at the door. I'll be right there. Oh excuse me Perry the Platypus, what can I do- (He opens the door, freeing Perry, who punches Doofenshmirtz into the Dupic-8-inator, setting it off) Oh see there, that's, that's the willy-nilly button. (Perry dives at Doofenshmirtz, while the -inator fires off randomly)"
2,43,Candace,"Mom, this place is so fancy-shmancy."
2,43,Linda,I just hope it isn't too noisy with that silly parade going on outside.
2,43,Candace,"Believe me, I'm trying to tune it out."
2,43,Linda,"So, what looks good to you?"
2,43,Candace,"(Blocking her view of the parade with her menu) Remember the pharaoh's curse. Wait! It doesn't count if she sees them herself! Hey mom, I bet you can't turn your head 180 degrees like an owl."
2,43,Linda,"(Turning her head) Nope, just ninety."
2,43,Candace,"Hey, can you show me that twisty yoga move you do again?"
2,43,Linda,"Maybe after lunch, dear."
2,43,Candace,"I'm curious what the back of you chair looks like, can you turn around and show me?"
2,43,Linda,"Okay, Candace, what's up?"
2,43,Candace,Mom! Why can't you just turn around!!??
2,43,Linda,"(turning, just as Phineas and Ferb's floats leave) Okay you want me to turn around? I'm turning around. Can we just eat lunch now?!"
2,43,Candace,(pauses) Fine...
2,43,Buford,"(From atop a building, overlook the parade) If that parade makes it to the end, my hopes for the Adjacent Area secession are through. I gotta stop it."
2,43,Nerd,(Speaking with a German accent) What is your next plan? I know it is going to be something clever!
2,43,Buford,"That's it! The other accents were amusing, but that one's just offensive. (He hops onto one of the passing floats)"
2,43,Nerd,(Still speaking with the accent) Wait! What about me?
2,43,Buford,I'm firin' you as my nerd.
2,43,Nerd,Das ist nicht gut. (This is not good.)
2,43,Isabella,"Well, that's weird that our floats are floating away."
2,43,Phineas,"Yeah, well, they are called ""floats""."
2,43,Buford,"(From atop one of the floating floats) What the–? (He unties a singular balloon, that pulls him away)"
2,43,Doofenshmirtz,"A platypus balloon? (The balloon passes by a billboard with a man wearing a fedora, and the balloon picks the hat up.) A Perry the Platypus balloon?!"
2,43,Linda,Candace I'm having a great time with you today. See how relaxing to os when you're not abscessing about your brothers?
2,43,Candace,"I can't take it anymore!! Mom, I really tried to my best to give you a day, but it's...the boys. The boys! They're in the parade! With giant floats! So come on, you've gotta bust them. (Grabs her and runs off)"
2,43,Buford,"(Still floating on the balloon, and seeing the Tri-State area) Wow, it's all just one, big place. No Bi-State area. No Adjacent Area, It's all just one big Tri-State Area, right over there! (The string he was holding onto rips off the balloon, opening a hole on the balloon) Mamma!"
2,43,Doofenshmirtz,"You know this balloon is actually– (He is cut off, as the balloon flutters about wildly) AHH! Curse you Perry the Platypus Balloon!!"
2,43,Baljeet,"(Seeing Buford fall) Oh no! Buford is in trouble! I must do something! (He goes to a man selling balloons) Please, my bully is in trouble, let go of all of your balloons."
2,43,Balloon Man,"Yeah, okay. (He releases all of his balloons)"
2,43,Baljeet,Thank you.
2,43,Balloon Man,"No, thank you, vegetable samosa."
2,43,Fighter jet Pilot,"Uh, did you guys see that? Let's investigate."
2,43,Phineas,"What we really need is a grand finale, so spectacular, that people will always remember Tri-State Area Unification Day."
2,43,Isabella,Hey what's that?
2,43,Buford,"(Coming down from his balloon, then releasing them) Happy...Tri-State...Unification...Day! Woo-Yeah!"
2,43,Fighter jet Pilot,"Yeah, just some Unification Day Parade stunt."
2,43,Phineas,That'll do it. Hey Buford great finale.
2,43,Isabella,"Yeah, it was really, really nice."
2,43,Buford,"Nice? Ah, now I gotta go do some'in' to balance out the universe. See ya' on the news. (He walks off)"
2,43,Baljeet,"Wait, wait, no Buford. No. No. No. Please don't. (A red liquid splashes Phineas, Ferb and Isabella) I was going to eat those jelly doughnuts."
2,43,Buford,Missed ya' Baljeet.
2,43,Baljeet,Right back at ya' buddy.
2,43,Ferb,An thus the universe is balanced.
2,43,Linda,Candace!
2,43,Candace,"Behold, Phineas and Ferb have taken over the parade!"
2,43,Phineas,Hi mom!
2,43,Isabella,Hi Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher.
2,43,Irving,Hi Phineas and Ferb's mom. Say Cheese! (He takes a picture)
2,43,Linda,"Oh, how adorable!"
2,43,Pharaoh,Excuse me. Are you Candace Gertrude Flynn?
2,43,Candace,(pauses) Yes.
2,43,Pharaoh,Curse you. (He walks off)
2,43,Linda,"I tried to warn you, honey."
2,57,Phineas,"It says on this box of cereal that I have to get Korny the Cornflake through this maze. If I was Korny, I would want a little more of a challenge. They just don't make good puzzles or mazes any more."
2,57,Phineas,Mazes should be big and fun and exciting! Ferb...
2,57,Ferb,You don't even need to say it.
2,57,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Whatcha doin'?"
2,57,Candace,"Well, Jeremy is taking me roller-skating tonight. And I thought I needed a little practi... (Screams)"
2,57,Phineas,"Let's get started. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,57,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P... (Exclaims) Sorry, we haven't cleaned that entrance in a while. Don't worry, we have a moist towelette."
2,57,Major Monogram,"Anyhow, Doofenshmirtz has gone missing. We've used our global location scout and we can't find him anywhere. Even his answering machine has given us no clue as to where he is."
2,57,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Hello! You've reached Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. I'm not here right now, or am I? Muhehehehehe. Oh! And if you're calling about the piano its already been sold."
2,57,Major Monogram,We Need you to find him. Good luck Agent P. Monogram out.
2,57,Phineas,It looks like we're good to go. Time to test out our maze.
2,57,Baljeet,Did someone say test!?
2,57,Phineas,It's not really a test. We're more like lab rats going after cheese.
2,57,Buford,Did someone say cheese?
2,57,Phineas,Buford that's just a metaphor.
2,57,Buford,Mmmm. I am to metaphor cheese as metaphor cheese is to some transitive verb crackers.
2,57,Melissa,"And I want to get the zoo keeping patch, and the cooking patch, and the astronomy patch."
2,57,Isabella,"Oh, Melissa. You remind me of me, when I was a Lil' Spark."
2,57,Melissa,"When I grow up and become a Fireside girl, do you think I'll earn as many patches as you have?"
2,57,Isabella,"With your enthusiasm, you'll probably earn even more."
2,57,Melissa,You really think so? Cause that's my goal. I want to be just like you.
2,57,Isabella,"Hey, everybody. This is Melissa."
2,57,Buford,"Yeah, Hi."
2,57,Baljeet,Hello.
2,57,Phineas,Hey-Ya.
2,57,Melissa,Isabella is my mentor for today. She's the best Fireside Girl ever.
2,57,Isabella,I'm sure they don't want to hear about...
2,57,Phineas,"Hey, Candace."
2,57,Candace,What is this thing?
2,57,Phineas,It's our elevator to the top of the maze.
2,57,Candace,Well make it go down.
2,57,Phineas,"It doesn't go down, it only goes up."
2,57,Candace,"Ooh, you guys are going down!"
2,57,Doofenshmirtz Doll,"Hello Perry the Platypus... Sorry I'm not there to greet you myself, but this is... a trap."
2,57,Candace,Why would you build an elevator that doesn't go down?
2,57,Phineas,"Because, people might just ride down on the elevator instead of going through the maze."
2,57,Candace,What do you mean maze...?
2,57,Phineas,"We had the computer randomly load puzzles and brain teasers to make clearing each level more of a challenge. Okay, first one out is the smartest rat in the lab."
2,57,Isabella,Do you want to go through the maze with me?
2,57,Melissa,Yes! Yes! Yes!
2,57,Isabella,"Candace, would you like to join Melissa and me?"
2,57,Candace,Candace Flynn can find her own way out.
2,57,Melissa,"Oh, my gosh! You're Candace Flynn! You're the girl who earned 50 patches in one day! You're on the cover of Lil Sparks Magazine! How did you do it?"
2,57,Candace,"Well, let me tell you some thing kid. It wasn't easy. But the Forest Fire Girls really needed me."
2,57,Isabella,Fireside Girls.
2,57,Candace,"That's what I said. Come on girls, I'll get us out of here."
2,57,Melissa,Yay! Candace is gonna lead us to safety!
2,57,Buford,"Brain teasers, huh? Alright you do all the ones that rely on brains, and I'll do all the ones that rely on teasin'."
2,57,Baljeet,I do not think you understand the concept.
2,57,Buford,Less talk-y more work-y.
2,57,(Song,"""Not Knowing Where You're Going"")"
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,"Ahh, Perry the Platypus, welcome to my evil space station! (Echo: Station -tation -tation Cookie -tation) Wait, did you hear that? That ""cookie"" part? I think my echo is broken, I really do. Any who...have a seat. I've set up a presentation for you. Ten years ago I was backpacking across Europe, when I came across a group of Canadian college student. Dylan was the most popular among the group, but but I was the oldest, so rivalry was inevitable."
2,57,Buford,How many jellybeans in the jar?
2,57,Baljeet,"Oh, I'm really good on solving these kind of problems."
2,57,Phineas,So the base of the jar is Pi times radius squared.
2,57,Baljeet,"You are measuring the radius in centimeters, right?"
2,57,Phineas,"No, inches. That way the inches fractions work with Pi as 22 over 7."
2,57,Baljeet,You do not use 3.14 for Pi?
2,57,Buford,"OH, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"
2,57,Buford,"There, zero."
2,57,Baljeet,"Okay, technically that is correct, but you did not show your work."
2,57,Buford,I will in about 20 minutes.
2,57,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"...then the Ambassador's wife filed a complaint... Long story short, I am never welcome in Albania ever again. But the point is, I ended up alone in Italy, and it was lunch time, so I went to the Leaning Tower of Pizza, and you know what? They don't even make pizza there! And I said, ""What do they mean?"" It's the Leaning Tower of Pizza! It's got "" pizza"" actually in the name! But they were adamant. ""No pizza for me!"" L-L-Likelike I'm the idiot. I was like, ""You're not so great. You're not so special. What? Just 'cause you're leaning?"" Then it hit me. I'll just lean my own building, and then it will become a big tourist attraction, and I'll sell all this merchandise, I'll make millions. Which I will then use to finance phase two of my maniacal plan: Tilting every building in the world! And the Leaning Tower of Pizza will no long be special. Ooh, ooh, and then I'll straighten my own building, and it will still be a tourist attract, 'cause you know, it's the only straight building. I just now thought of that. Just now. See that's how genius happens. It's a lot of leaning and straightening, you get the idea. I'm going to use this Tilt-inator, and do it all from space! (Echo: Space Space Space Cookie Space) There! There it was again. You -- you heard that? My next to last echo is broken. I'm going to have to have that checked."
2,57,Isabella,"Wow, it's some kind of high wire challenge, good thing I got my high wire patch, twice."
2,57,Candace,"Did, you get fifty, in one day? Okay then. Now Melissa... (begins drifting onto the high wire) The thing to remember about a high wire is..."
2,57,Isabella,Candace! Be careful!
2,57,Candace,See? It's that simple.
2,57,Melissa,Okay.
2,57,Candace,"Isabella, do something!"
2,57,Isabella,Hold on Melissa.
2,57,Melissa,(at Candace) Oh my gosh. Thank you for telling Isabella to save me.
2,57,Candace,Well what did you think I was going to do? Let Isabella let you fall?
2,57,Isabella,Glad I was able help.
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,"The Tilt-inator is set with an automatic timer, once it's activated, even I can't stop it. All that's left to do is open the bay doors, this may take awhile."
2,57,Melissa,How far down is it?
2,57,Isabella,"I don't know, I can't see the bottom. But it almost doesn't matter, so long as we get across it."
2,57,Candace,"Of course we need to know how deep it is, so we know how scared we should be. We can use this grappling hook and rope to find out. (throws it into the pit) One...Two...Three. (The rope hits the bottom) You see? Now we know that it's three seconds deep."
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,"...And done. So Perry the Platypus, in fifteen seconds, will turn my building into the leaning tower of Doofenshmirtz! And you'll notice, there's no self-destruct button, no reverse levers, no abort switches, it's completely Perry the Platy-proof! Nothing can stop me now!"
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,Uh oh. No no no no no! Stop stop stop stop stop! Stop it!
2,57,Computer,...Four...Three...Two...One...
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, no! Why would you even do this? Now I need to open the door and reset the Tilt-inator countdown to fire again."
2,57,Isabella,"Okay... Now that we want to get across, it sure would be nice to have a grappling hook and some rope."
2,57,Candace,"Oh yeah. Yeah, where can we get a grappling... I know it's right over--! Oops."
2,57,Isabella,"Oh, would you look at that."
2,57,Candace,The platform's retracting! What are we going to do?
2,57,Isabella,You're the girl one who got fifty Fireside patches in one day.
2,57,Melissa,"That's right, Candace will get us out of this? Won't you Candace?"
2,57,Candace,That was a fake! I only did it to get into a concert! If it wasn't for Isabella and my brothers I never could have done it. (Melissa gasps in shock) Now will you please save me?
2,57,Isabella,Give me one of your roller-skates.
2,57,Candace,Here.
2,57,Isabella,"Now if I take the shoelace and... (She throws it, creating a gripping hook, latching onto some of the piping)"
2,57,Candace,Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
2,57,Candace,"Oh this is just great! I thought you were going to save us, I though you were supposed to be this perfect Firefighter Girl."
2,57,Isabella,Fireside Girl!
2,57,Candace,That's what I said.
2,57,Isabella,"Wait there's a lever in the middle, but I can't reach it."
2,57,Candace,Well I can't reach it either.
2,57,Isabella,I bet the rope you threw away was longer than your shoelace.
2,57,Candace,Oh? So now it's my fault?
2,57,Melissa,You got another shoelace.
2,57,Candace,What?
2,57,Melissa,"Right here, look!"
2,57,Candace,Yes! I still have time to bust the boys before my skate date! (runs into the house) Mom!
2,57,Isabella,"Come on Melissa, lets get you home."
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,...and done. Now with the—Hey! Where'd you go? What are you doing up there?
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,Nooo!
2,57,Computer,...Three...Two...One...
2,57,Candace,"Mom, you have to see this! Phineas and Ferb made a giant maze in the backyard!"
2,57,Linda,(flatly) What maze?
2,57,Candace,(Looks over to see that the maze disappeared) It was right here!
2,57,Linda,"Alright, Candace. (She grabs her arm.) Inside. (She pulls Candace back inside.)"
2,57,Candace,"But, but, but..."
2,57,Doofenshmirtz,Perry the Platypus! Wait for me!
2,57,Singers,♪ Agent P! ♪
2,57,Baljeet,"Wow, you guys thought of everything!"
2,57,Phineas,We didn't think of this one. Okay guys I see the exit. ...And stop!
2,57,Buford,"Wow, that was at least three seconds deep."
2,57,Phineas,It's a good thing the girls beat us out.
2,57,Isabella,(As Melissa boards the Little Sparks bus) Bye Melissa. See you next week.
2,57,Phineas,Everything worked out just fine.
2,57,Buford,"Hey! I never got my metaphor cheese! (Echo: cheese cheese cheese wombat cheese) Huh, my echo must be broken."
2,41,Candace,"(from inside, chuckles) Oh, Jeremy, I had no idea you've felt that way about me. (Cut to inside; she is talking to a paper mache Jeremy.) But I still have a lot to accomplish before I get married. (pause) Hold on. (puts candles between it) Much more romantic. (the phone rings) It's you! (on phone, in dreamy voice) Hello, Jeremyyyy!"
2,41,Jeremy,"Hi, Candace. I was wondering if you could do me a favor?"
2,41,Candace,(dreamy voice) Yeeeaaahhh...
2,41,Jeremy,"Listen, I got called into work and my parents aren't home, do you think you could look after Suzy for a few hours?"
2,41,Candace,(dreamy voice) Yeeeaaahhh...
2,41,Jeremy,I'll be right over. Thanks!
2,41,Candace,(dreamy voice) Yeeeaaahhh... (needle scratch) Huh? Uh -- wait -- what did you say? Jeremy? NO! JEREMY! (to the paper mache) I'll be right back. (runs out panicking) Mom! Mom!
2,41,Candace,Moooom! Jeremy's dropping off his little sister and I --
2,41,Linda,How nice. A babysitting job.
2,41,Candace,"No, Mom, you don't understand! She's EVIL!"
2,41,Linda,"Don't be silly, Candace. She's just a little girl. How much trouble could she be? (Sees Phineas and Ferb under an out of control sprinkler) I see you've discovered the broken sprinkler. Yeah, I'd better get to the hardware store! It's beginning to look like Niagara Falls out here."
2,41,Phineas,"Niagara Falls? (sits up) Know anything about that, Ferb-meister?"
2,41,Ferb,(sits up) It's over 167 feet high. It's also tremendously popular with daredevils.
2,41,Phineas,"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry?"
2,41,Major Monogram,"(with lots of unshaven hairs on his face) I can't believe you forgot to pick up new razors, Carl! Now I have to go on camera without a clean shave!"
2,41,Carl,"Me, too, sir."
2,41,Major Monogram,What? You don't have a single hair!
2,41,Carl,"I have one, sir."
2,41,Major Monogram,"Ew! Agent P, you're here! We're getting very suspicious about Doofenshmirtz. He hasn't ordered any bulk items from the Internet in days. Get over there and put a start to it! (Perry salutes.)"
2,41,Major Monogram,"Carl, you disgust and fascinate me."
2,41,Candace,"Suzy'll be here any second! I hafta get this place in shape! Must! Hide! Anything! Suzy! Can! Use! Against me! (She throws away kitchen knives, the microwave, the blender, and Mr. Miggins in the trash. The doorbell rings. Cut to the front door, Jeremy and his little sister appear. Candace answers it wearing a very heavy protective suit.) Oh, hey! Hi, Jeremy!"
2,41,Jeremy,Candace? What's with the outfit?
2,41,Candace,I get...cold.
2,41,Jeremy,"(in non-belief) Uh...huh. Well, it's a statement. You guys have fun now. Bye!"
2,41,Phineas,"Y'know, even though I know that was papier-mâché, that's still an impressive throw!"
2,41,Isabella,"Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'?"
2,41,Phineas,"Hey, guys! (to Baljeet, who is inside a baby carrier held by Buford) What's with the baby carrier?"
2,41,Baljeet,Ask him.
2,41,Buford,"(chewing gum) My chiropractor recommended it. It's just as humiliating as a half-nelson, and easier on my tennis elbow. (crunching loudly)"
2,41,Phineas,What's that grinding sound?
2,41,Buford,Tuff Gum! Like the song sez...
2,41,(Song,"""Tuff Gum"")"
2,41,Phineas,"Wow, can I have some?"
2,41,Buford,"Nah, I don't think so. It's for bullies only."
2,41,Phineas,(to Ferb) You got any regular gum?
2,41,Phineas,"Alright, everyone. Ferb and I have built a giant waterfall, right. And we wanna do a test run. Who's in?"
2,41,Buford and Isabella,(raising their hands) Me!
2,41,Baljeet,Can I go?
2,41,Buford,"Well, just be careful. Cuz I worry about you."
2,41,(Cut to,)
2,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. (Perry gets tied up by a pair of electronic hands tying a shoelace around him.) How do you like my new Shoelace-inator? It's the perfect match for my new Carbon-Footprint-inator! (Cut to what looks like a giant black foot.) I made it entirely out of carbon paper I kept from the 1970s. I always thought it was going to come back. Tsk. Shame. Anyway, people are always talking 'bout reducing their carbon footprint. I don't really know what that means, but it sounds evil. ""Carbon footprint."" So, my plan is to leave giant carbon footprints all over the Tri-State Area! (Cut to Perry attempting to bite off his trap.) Don't bother, it's double-knotted."
2,41,Suzy,"(evilly) So, Candace, are you ready to have some...fun?!"
2,41,Candace,N-No-no-no. I'm good. I hate fun.
2,41,Suzy,I've got a little game we can play.
2,41,Candace,G-g-g-g-game?
2,41,Suzy,(rummaging through her backpack) It's called making...
2,41,Candace,M-m-making?
2,41,Suzy,...paper...
2,41,Candace,P-p-p-paper?
2,41,Suzy,(nicely) ...dolls!
2,41,Candace,PAPER DOLLS?!?! Huh?
2,41,Suzy,It's for you!
2,41,Candace,For me? Aren't you going to do something horrible to me?
2,41,Suzy,"Oh, no. Making you look bad is just one of the ways I control Jeremy. If he's not here, I'm off the clock."
2,41,Candace,"Wait, you can control your brother?"
2,41,Suzy,Can't you get your brothers to do anything you want?
2,41,Candace,No way! I can't get them to do anything!
2,41,Suzy,Un-ac-ceptable. To the backyard!
2,41,Suzy,"Hey, guys! (giggles) What'cha doin'?"
2,41,Isabella,"(angrily) Um, hello?!"
2,41,Phineas,"Hey, Suzy! We were just puttin' the finishing touches on our waterfall ride."
2,41,Suzy,"Ah, just watching all this work makes me thirsty. What I wouldn't do for a cool lemonade."
2,41,Phineas,"Lemonade? Whatever you'd like, Suzy. (Ferb gives Suzy a glass.)"
2,41,Suzy,Thank you. (She sips as Candace looks in surprise.)
2,41,Candace,I have so much to learn.
2,41,Suzy,"Well, now that you've watched the master at work, it's time for you to get yours."
2,41,Candace,"Me? Oh, no! I'm not ready! I-I..."
2,41,Suzy,What do you want?
2,41,Candace,To bust my brothers?
2,41,Suzy,(like a drill sergeant) Is that a question or a mission?!
2,41,Candace,A mission.
2,41,Suzy,So say it!!
2,41,Candace,I wanna bust my brothers!
2,41,Suzy,MEAN IT!!!
2,41,Candace,I wanna bust my brothers!!
2,41,Suzy,OWN IT.
2,41,Candace,I WANNA BUST MY BROTHERS!!!!!!
2,41,Suzy,"Even better, get them to bust themselves."
2,41,Candace,Get my brothers to bust themselves? (in realization) Get my brothers to bust themselves. Get my brothers to bust themselves!! GET MY BROTHERS TO BUST THEMSELVES!!! GET MY BROTHERS TO BUST THEMSELVES!!!
2,41,Suzy,"GO, GO!!!!"
2,41,Candace,GET MY BROTHERS TO BUST THEMSELLLLLLLVES!!!!!!
2,41,Candace,"(walks up to them) Hey, boys! What'cha doin'?"
2,41,Isabella,"Ugh, do I even need to be here?!"
2,41,Phineas,Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Wanna come? It's gonna be sweet!
2,41,Baljeet,(being carried by Buford up the ladder) If Buford does not drop me first.
2,41,Buford,Tuff guys don't drop stuff. ♪ Tuff Gum!! ♪
2,41,Suzy,"Alright, Candace! Time ta bring it on home!"
2,41,Candace,"Phineas and Ferb, I want you to pick up the phone right now—"
2,41,Suzy,Psst! (smiles widely)
2,41,Phineas,"Everything okay, Candace?"
2,41,Candace,(back in her normal face) D'oh! Can you just help me out and call Mom?!
2,41,Phineas,What? So she can come and see this gigantic insanely high waterfall we built in the backyard?
2,41,Candace,Yes?
2,41,Phineas,"Great idea! Can I borrow your phone? (Candace gives Phineas her phone, and he dials.)"
2,41,Candace,(to Suzy) Hey! (Suzy gives Candace a thumbs up.)
2,41,Linda,Whadaya know? It's Candace. Right on schedule. So what kind of unbelievable contraption have Phineas and Ferb built that requires me to come home immediately?
2,41,Phineas,An unbelievably cool waterfall ride right in our backyard! You gotta come home right away!
2,41,Linda,"Phineas? Is that you? You sound just like Candace. I mean, you sound like you, but the things you're saying—"
2,41,Phineas,(on phone) Hurry up! You gotta see it!
2,41,Linda,"Alright, alright, just as soon as I find the right sprinkler part! (hangs up) I curse the day these things were invented!"
2,41,Doofenshmirtz,"(a little hoarsely) Everything is going— (clears throat) Everything is going according to my plan! Soon, Danville will know what it is to be trodden upon by true genius! (Perry attempts to get out of his trap) I think I'll start with a pond or bushes or something. You know, to beef up the whole anti-environmental theme I've been dancing around. (Perry finally comes loose from his trap.) Wait, where was that from? (Perry punches Doofenshmirtz.) How did you get out of that double knot? (Perry flings himself at Doofenshmirtz, but Doofenshmirtz pulls a lever opening a window, and Perry jumps out.) Hey, you like the window? I just had it installed! Sayonara, Perry the Platypus! (Agent P's parachute pops out.)"
2,41,Phineas,"Alright, Buford, we're ready for you! You can let 'er rip!"
2,41,Buford,Roger that! (grinds loudly)
2,41,Isabella,Better eighty-six the gum. It's a choking hazard.
2,41,Buford,"Oh, all right. (takes it out and sticks it onto the faucet) But I'll be back for that bad boy. Alright, let's do this!"
2,41,Phineas,I CAN'T WAIT FOR MOM TO SEE THIS!!
2,41,Candace,This is it! Today's the day! It's my day! It is my day!!
2,41,Baljeet,But was Buford not in the barrel with us?
2,41,Buford,Bullseye!
2,41,(Cut to Perry at a building with a sign that says,"""MR. BANANA WHOLE SALE."" Pan left to a truck.)"
2,41,Phineas,"Whoa, that was great! I can't wait for Mom to see it!"
2,41,Candace,"Me, too! (car horn honks) Mom's home! Yes! (grabbing Phineas) C'mon! Let's go tell Mom! Let's go let's go let's go!"
2,41,Manager,"Congratulations! You are now an official driver for the Mr. Banana Company. (Perry drives off) Man, that is so funny, I literally just wrote a song about a platypus driving a banana truck! Hmm. Hmm? Wait! My demo!"
2,41,(Song,"""Alabama Bound"")"
2,41,Candace,Mom Mom! Phineas wants to show you something!!
2,41,Phineas,We built Niagara Falls in the backyard! Wanna see it?
2,41,Linda,"Why, I'd love to, honey."
2,41,Candace,Yes! Yes! Finally!
2,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, Danville, get ready for a carbon footprint you'll never forget!! (The Carbon-Footprint-inator stomps onto the faucet, but the gum gets stuck to it.) What? What? Oh, see? This! This is why I hate nature! It's always getting stuck to your foot! Yech!"
2,41,Doofenshmirtz,There ya go.
2,41,(Cut to the farmer and his wife outside a building with a sign that reads,"""Spring Water Bottling."")"
2,41,Farmer's Wife,I can't believe it! You walk away from a profitable miniature golf franchise and open up a spring water bottling plant right in the middle of town! What? Didja think a mountain spring was just gonna fall out of the sky?
2,41,Farmer,You never believed in me.
2,41,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, we'll try this again. Blah blah blah carbon footprint! (Cut to trucker Perry. He pulls the brakes, and the back part lifts, dropping the big banana off of it. The carbon footprint slips and kicks the blimp deflating it. Doofenshmirtz sighs.) I suppose this was inevitable. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (Crash!)"
2,41,Linda,"Well, kids, you're right. It does look like Niagara Falls back here. (Puts a sprinkler part on the leak.) But this part will fix that. Voila! So, who wants pie!"
2,41,Candace,No! How could this be?! It was supposed to work this time! Don't you have anything to say?!
2,41,Suzy,Results may vary?
2,41,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace!"
2,41,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy!"
2,41,Suzy,"(giving Candace a hose) Hold this, please."
2,41,Jeremy,How's it going?
2,41,Candace,Perfect! Everything is— (gets squirted) Guess we're back on the clock.

2,55,Phineas,"Candace, you're fine. It's all special effects. (Presses a button; Red grids flash and the place turns into Candace's room)"
2,55,Candace,Special effects?
2,55,Phineas,"Yeah, cool, huh? Ferb and I are warming up before we meet our special effects hero Clive Addison today at the Science-Fiction and Fantasy Convention."
2,55,Candace,"(Gets up) That explains why you're dressed in costumes from ""Giant Losers: The Musical""!"
2,55,Phineas,"Actually, I'm dressed as Captain Lump Sharkboard from Space Adventure XIV. And Ferb is dressed as Hymie Silverman from Stumbleberry Finkbat and the Whining Wand of the Turtle Wizard. They're the two biggest movie series of all-time, and Clive Addison did the special effects for both."
2,55,Candace,"Ugh! Stop being related to me! And take all your mirrors, and zebras, and junk and get out of my room!"
2,55,Phineas,"Zebras? (Ferb shrugs) Anyway, Ferb and I aren't in your room. We're already at the convention! (Presses a remote's button) Special effects! (He and Ferb disappear, as red grids flash on them. At the convention, a camera folds up and a briefcase closes) Look at it, Ferb. (Camera pans to the convention building) Science-Fiction and Fantasy, together at last. (Camera pans to him and Ferb) It's breathtaking. Let's get in there! Hey..."

2,55,Finkie,Yeah man! You tell him!
2,55,Irving,Realistic? Space Adventure is based on hard scientific fact. It's like watching a reality show from the distant future. (The crowd of Speckies agrees loudly)

2,55,Phineas,Oh come on. Did you ever consider that fans of Space Adventur-
2,55,Baljeet,Speckies!
2,55,Phineas,"Right, speckies. Have more in common with fans of Stumbleberry Finkba-"
2,55,Baljeet,Finkies!
2,55,Phineas,Maybe Speckies and Finkies have more in common then they do differences.
2,55,Baljeet,Oh! Bite this prop tongue from episode eight! (produces said prop tongue)
2,55,Phineas,Have you ever tried talking to them?
2,55,Baljeet,Talk!? Have you met the leader of the Finkies?
2,55,Buford,"I'm sure you're wondering why I, Buford, have taken a leadership role in such a geek-centered enterprise. Well, take a look around! This place is crawling with nerds! I'm like a kid in a candy store! Plus, I relate to the character of Odaf Underhump and his complex emotional inner journey."
2,55,Baljeet,I seriously doubt this will work. Buford is not a man of peace.
2,55,Phineas,"Nonsense, I'm sure Buford will be reasonable."
2,55,Buford,Hey! No space bunnies allowed!
2,55,Baljeet,I am not a bunny rabbit! I am an Almordian Vanksloth.
2,55,Phineas,"It's time to end this silly feud, so we can all enjoy Clive Addison's special effects presentation. Baljeet, you prepared a peace treaty."
2,55,Baljeet,"I did. (Clears his throat) We Speckies vow to live in peace and harmony with you Finkies. All that we ask is that you admit that Space adventure is much better than Stumbleberry Finkbat, and that you have brought eternal shame to your families believing otherwise."
2,55,Phineas,Umm... that's not really what I said-
2,55,Buford,Oh yeah!? You and what army?
2,55,Baljeet,Your question makes no sense as a response to what I just said.
2,55,Buford,"Well, how 'bout this? (Ties Baljeet's costume's ears into a knot)"
2,55,Baljeet,"(feels about on top of his head and becomes angry when he discovers the knot) Alright, so it is war then!"
2,55,Buford,"Bring it on, Speckies! We're gonna go all Hyborian age on you!"

2,54,Phineas,"Hey, do you mind? We have a visual gag going on here. (It disappears to reveal Ferb used a triangle to make the noise) Thank you! (To Ferb) Our vacation is more than halfway over, and what have we accomplished? Okay, so we built a rollercoaster, we traveled through time twice, found Atlantis, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, see? We've hardly done anything! We need a real challenge. We need to create the biggest, longest, funnest summer day of all time!"
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Well, Vanessa, are you looking forward to seeing Tokyo on our daddy-daughter trip?"
2,54,Vanessa,"Yeah... I was really hoping for Paris. I mean, I did drop all those hints, but I guess Tokyo is more exotic."
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, that's why I chose Japan over Paris at the last moment! That makes perfect sense. There is no other ulterior motive behind it all, so, you know..."
2,54,Airplane Captain,"Uh, this is your captain speaking, we're expecting a slight delay for our arrival to Tokyo."
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"That's always something. Turbulence, headwinds, giant jump-roping robots..."
2,54,Robot,"(Hanging on the jet airplane) I dangle, therefore, I am..."
2,54,Candace,"So Mom, while you're away, I'm in charge, right? For two whole days?"
2,54,Linda,"That's right. Remember, no boys over."
2,54,Candace,"Of course, Mom. Jeremy's in Paris anyway. So... When you say I'm in charge, what exactly do you mean by that?"
2,54,Linda,"Well, to put it simply, I mean, ""You're in charge."""
2,54,Candace,"So if Phineas and Ferb are up to something bust-worthy, and I am, as you say... ""In charge"", I have free reign to call you as many times as necessary?"
2,54,Lawrence,"Quite the contrary, Candace. Being in charge means you handle things yourself."
2,54,Linda,"Yup. Basically, if you're really in charge, you won't need to call at all. You see, if the boys are doing something bust-worthy, that means you're not doing your job and you would be in trouble too."
2,54,Candace,"Woah, woah, heavy! By busting the boys, I bust myself?"
2,54,Lawrence,"Ah, there's the rub. Right next to the pair o' ducks. I'm also packing this book of puns!"
2,54,Linda,Bye kids!
2,54,Candace,"Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Have a nice time!"
2,54,Phineas,Have a successful endeavor!
2,54,Candace,(Dreaming) Paris... French girls and... Jeremy... Iguana playing an oboe... (She sits up and calls someone) Stacy? I am freaking out here!
2,54,Stacy,Ugh... I'll be right over.
2,54,Candace,Cool! Thanks! And could you bring some breakfast? (Stacy hangs up) Hello?
2,54,Isabella,"So Phineas, whatcha doin'... Up so early?"
2,54,Phineas,"Today is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year! And Ferb and I are gonna make it even longer."
2,54,Isabella,So you built the Statue of Liberty?
2,54,Phineas,"No... (Sees his invention in shape of the Statue of Liberty) Oh, wow. That is weird. (He removes the sheet cover) Behold! The Amazing Sun-Beater 3000!"
2,54,Isabella/Fireside Girls,Wow! Amazing!
2,54,Buford,It's a name followed by a big number!
2,54,Phineas,"It's fast and it runs on vegetable oil, so it's environmentally friendly. In this ship, we will travel around the world as the sun does, making this, the longest day of summer, even longer! That'll give us twenty-four hours of continuous daylight; and add the extra fifteen hours we would've had anyway, that's almost a forty-hour day!"
2,54,Buford,It can't be done! There's only twenty-four hours in a day and that's that!
2,54,Phineas,"Well, yes and no. You see, Buford, if you define the day by the passage of the sun, and we follow the sun by traveling around the..."
2,54,Buford,"Nah, nah! Don't try to confuse me with your sorcerous ways. There's nothin' I've ever seen that would make me believe you could pull this off. Except for that time-machine thing, and oh, and the rollercoaster! But other than that, nothin'! Oh, and the time you played that song when the platypus came back, oh... Man, nature just bends to your will, doesn't it?"
2,54,Phineas,"Yeah, nothing's impossible if you believe you could do it."
2,54,Buford,"Well, I don't believe and therefore it's impossible. And what's more, I bet you can't do it!"
2,54,Phineas,You bet us?
2,54,Buford,"Yeah, I bet you! And if you lose, you're gonna have to stand up in front of everyone and say that you are governed by the laws of physics and summer's not whatever you want to make of it. And what's more, you've gonna spend the rest of your summer doin' nothin'!"
2,54,Phineas,And what happens when we win?
2,54,Buford,Hmmm... I'll eat a bug.
2,54,Phineas,"Buford, you'd eat a bug right now if we asked."
2,54,Buford,Are you asking?
2,54,Phineas,No.
2,54,Buford,All right. How about I give you back your bike I took when we were little?
2,54,Phineas,My bike!
2,54,Baby Phineas,Bu gaga gu...
2,54,Baby Buford,Mine!
2,54,Baby Phineas,No... Bu gaga gu.
2,54,Phineas,"How about this? When we make it back here before the sun sets, you gotta give everyone their bikes back."
2,54,Random man,Mine was the one with the unusually large front wheel.
2,54,Buford,"I still get to eat the bug though, right?"
2,54,Phineas,"Sure thing, Buford."
2,54,Buford,I want the bug.
2,54,Isabella,"Phineas, what are you doing? You're putting your entire world view on the line. And for what? A bunch of bikes?"
2,54,Buford,And a bug!
2,54,Phineas,"Isabella, it isn't about the bikes. It's about my world view. You see, we all gotta ask ourselves just one question."

I mean me."" Kinda weird, though, that he took the time to cut each letter out of a magazine. Anyway, Doof is on vacation with his daughter in Tokyo right now which is where the Annual World Good Guy convention is being held, and Major Monogram is the keynote speaker. Coincidence? 100% yes! So I guess you got the day off!"
2,54,Stacy,"All right, you got your breakfast. What's eating you?"
2,54,Candace,"Well, you know how Jeremy's in France for another week?"
2,54,Stacy,"Yeah, so?"
2,54,Candace,Do you know what they have in France?
2,54,Stacy,The pyramids?
2,54,Candace,No! French girls!
2,54,Stacy,"Come on, Candace. Everybody knows that you and Jeremy are an item."
2,54,Candace,"Not officially... He's never even called me his girlfriend. We've never even kissed! That means Jeremy's single, in Paris, and surrounded by French girls. I'm no fool, Stacy, I've seen the oil paintings."
2,54,Stacy,"Candace, you got to believe in yourself. What do French girls have that you don't have?"
2,54,Candace,"At the moment, Jeremy."
2,54,Stacy,"Candace, if you want him to call you his girlfriend, maybe you should call him your boyfriend."
2,54,Candace,I can do that? I can use the B-word first?
2,54,Stacy,"Sure, why not?"
2,54,Candace,"Oh, and Stacy, pyramids? Really?"
2,54,Stacy,"Oh, right. That's Belgium, isn't it?"
2,54,Vanessa,"Look at this, it says that the tallest structure in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower. And it even looks like the Eiffel Tower!"
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"See? It's just like we're in France! Oh, here's my bag now!"
2,54,Vanessa,I can't believe you brought work with you!

2,54,Vanessa,"Dad, you've got some guy tied up in here."
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"No, no, Vanessa. We've got some guy tied up in here."
2,54,Major Monogram,"I've got a name, you know."
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"All right. Vanessa, Major Monogram. Major Monogram, Vanessa. There, you happy now?!"
2,54,Major Monogram,I've never been happy.
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Come on, let's go get a taxi."
2,54,Major Monogram,I'd prefer a town car.
2,54,Dr. Doofenshmirtz,"Quiet, you!"
2,54,Phineas,"Okay, we're getting a slight late start because of the broken wing, but here's the whole route. With stops in Tokyo and Paris to refuel."
2,54,Isabella,You're going to Paris?
2,54,Phineas,"Yeah, wanna come?"
2,54,Isabella,To the City of Love?
2,54,Phineas,(Obliviously) That's what they call it.
2,54,Isabella,You're asking me to go to the City of Love with you?
2,54,Phineas,"Yeah, it'll be fun."
2,54,Isabella,"Now, let me see if I got this straight..."
2,54,Buford,Hey Dinner Bell! I'm goin' with you to make sure you don't cheat.
2,54,Phineas,"Okay. So Baljeet, you wanna come too?"
2,54,Baljeet,"Well, naturally--"
2,54,Buford,I get one carry-on.
2,54,Phineas,"All right. Carry on, then. Did you get that wing fixed yet?"
2,54,Chaka Khan,I guess so. We pretty much used up all the packing tape.
2,54,Phineas,"Okay, the clock is ticking, everyone!(Candace comes outside, ripping through the map)"
2,54,Candace,Phineas! What's going on here?
2,54,Phineas,"We're flying around the world to make the longest, funnest day of summer ever."
2,54,Candace,"Oh, no, no, no. Mom left me in charge, and I say you and your little friends are not going anywhere--"
2,54,Stacy,"Hey, Candace, check out this giant map!"
2,54,Candace,(Looks at the map) You're going to Paris...? France?
2,54,Phineas,That's the plan. We'll have to stop and refuel.
2,54,Candace,"(There's a short silence while she thinks before she gets a determined look on her face) Like I was saying, you and your little friends are not going anywhere...without me!"
2,54,Stacy,"No, no, no, no, Candace! This is a bad idea! About as bad as you've ever had in a loong line, and I love you when you say this, really, really bad ideas."
2,54,Candace,"Stacy, they're going to Paris! Where Jeremy is!"
2,54,Stacy,You promised your mom you'd keep your brothers out of trouble.
2,54,Candace,What better way to look after them than by going along and keeping them out of trouble along the way?
2,54,Stacy,"You realize that's a massive rationalization, don't you?"
2,54,Candace,"Oh yeah, totally."
2,54,Stacy,"Well, say hi to Jeremy for me! And hey, you should stop by and see my cousins in Tokyo!"
2,54,Phineas,"Ferb, did you get the giant map packed?"
2,54,Phineas,"Wow, mad folding skills. You guys all ready?"
2,54,Buford,Ready for you to lose!
2,54,Phineas,"Uh, Ferb?"
2,54,Phineas,"All right, everyone, make sure your tray tables are stowed and your seats are in their full and up--"
2,54,Adyson,"Okay, girls. We have roughly forty hours to get this backyard in line and set up for the party. Let's go, go, go!"
2,54,Clay Aiken,Who left her in charge?
2,54,Adyson,"Here, make yourself useful. (hands him a rake)"
2,54,Clay Aiken,"(Stares) You know, we're only booked for the hour!"
2,54,Phineas,"So, what did you guys think of the Pacific Ocean?"
2,54,Buford,"Eh, probably like my fifth favorite ocean."
2,54,Phineas,Next stop: Tokyo!
2,54,Vanessa,It says here that the Tokyo Tower is the tallest self-supporting steel structure in the world!
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, look down there, that guy just fell off his bike."
2,54,Vanessa,But..it says nothing about a...giant water balloon.
2,54,Vanessa,(Suspiciously) Dad?
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,Do you like it?
2,54,Vanessa,We're supposed to be on vacation.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, we'll be on our way as soon as Major Monogram drops this water balloon on the entire International Good Guy convention."
2,54,Major Monogram,"I would never pull an elaborate childish prank like that. It would ruin my reputation! Destroy my credita- oh, I see where you're going with this."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes! And best of all, without your leadership, it will totally put an end to the...yes... What's the name of your organization again?"
2,54,Major Monogram,The O.W.C.A. The Organization Without a Cool Acronym.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay. Well I'm going to put an end to Ah-ooh-CA, I guess...? Wow, that really isn't a cool acronym."
2,54,Major Monogram,Told ya.
2,54,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, Tokyo, Japan."
2,54,Candace,"Hey, Stacy has family down there. We should visit."
2,54,Phineas,"We're one step ahead of you, Candace."

2,54,Candace,I have no idea what just happened.
2,54,Major Monogram,No one in the Agency will ever believe that I dropped that water balloon.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, they will. Because you're going to confess that you did it on-camera for the world to see!"
2,54,Major Monogram,"You can't make me talk. I have nerves of steel and...an iron will and...gold teeth and a...copper spleen. Basically, I'm 35% metal."

2,54,Major Monogram,"Oh, don't get me started. Anyway, you can't make me talk."

2,54,Major Monogram,Well. I stand corrected. That's actually very convincing.

2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Vanessa, wait! (Vanessa stops) You have all the traveler's checks."
2,54,Vanessa,Traveler's checks? Really?!

2,54,Phineas,It's a good thing we came along when we did. So where do we drop you?
2,54,Vanessa,I don't know. Where are you guys going?

2,54,Vanessa,Can I just come with you?
2,54,Phineas,Sure.

2,54,Major Monogram,"Fine. But after we get her back, you're going to answer for what you've done here, mister."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, what? You were coming here, anyway, and... (He accidentally steps on the button and water balloon is released from the rope holding it to the tower and flies up into the sky) Oh, and uh... As far as flinging that water balloon into orbit, hehheh... (puts his fingers on Major Monogram's mouth again) ""I did that."""

2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Fortunately, Vanessa's wearing the earrings I got her. They're made out of these cool little tracking devices. Look, see; the signal's not too far away but it's on the move. Thataway! Woohoo! Team Doofenshmirtz, go! (Perry and Major Monogram glare) What? Like I'm going to let you name the team? Organization Without a Cool Acronym?"

2,54,Phineas,"Uhh, Uncle Sabu, do you live up here?"
2,54,Uncle Sabu,"Yes, it's quite a trek, isn't it? It used to be very inconvenient for me. But then I built my factory up here, and now it's inconvenient for everyone else!"

2,54,Doofenshmirtz,I got her! She's down there on that craggy mountain. Quick! Let's land this bird.
2,54,Major Monogram,"The terrain is too treacherous. You're going to have to parachute. Here's your parachute, goggles and oxygen mask."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow, you have everything. How about a nice cup of hot co... (The seat ejects him) COOOOOOO!!! (Doofenshmirtz lands on the mountain and begins to roll down, gathering snow and accidentally making a giant snowball)"
2,54,Vanessa,Do you hear a...rumbling noise?
2,54,Phineas,"So, as soon as Candace and Vanessa get here, we can..."
2,54,Candace,(She and Vanessa are running from the giant snowball while Candace shouts) Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane!

2,54,Candace,"Oh, never mind. I'll find it myself. (She turns the corner and sees the hotel) Hey, Hotel Poubelle! It was just around the corner! (She sees Jeremy) There he is! Jer -- (She stops when she sees Jeremy talking and having fun with some French kids. She looks depressed before walking away. A mime appears where she was previously standing, letting go of a balloon)"
2,54,Isabella,"So Phineas, what do you think of the City of Love?"
2,54,Phineas,I wish it was the City of Airplane Parts.
2,54,Isabella,"Oh, you're just too stressed. You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it."

2,54,Baljeet,"Now Buford, your mindless bullying may have a rustic charm stateside, but now we are in Europe. A place of high refinement. So let me do all the talking. (They go inside a restaurant and speaks with a man in a different accent) Excuse me, sir. Would you have any used cooking oil that we could have?"
2,54,Man,Non.
2,54,Baljeet,"Ohh, the French are so intimidating!"
2,54,Buford,"Out of my way, runt."
2,54,Baljeet,Do not do anything too crazy!
2,54,Buford,"(Cracks his fingers) Excusez-moi mon bon monsieur. Auriez-vous par hazard un soupçon d'huile de cuisson que nous pourrions utiliser sans nous démerder un sou? (Excuse me, good sir. Would you by chance have a touch of cooking oil that we could use without losing a penny?)"
2,54,Man,But of course.
2,54,Buford,(to Baljeet) Not one word about that to the others.
2,54,Phineas,"Pardonnez-moi, monsieur, are you throwing those away?"
2,54,Man,C'est les ordres.
2,54,Isabella,"This is about the plane, isn't it?"
2,54,Phineas,"Well yeah, what else?"
2,54,Isabella,"Well, I guess we'll always have giant plastic baguettes."
2,54,Vanessa,"I don't know, Ferb. I know he's my dad and I shouldn't blame him for being busy, it's just that...he always seems to put his work ahead of me. (She sighs) I just don't know what to do."
2,54,Ferb,"Well, sometimes if you love somebody, you have to meet them halfway."
2,54,Vanessa,"Halfway, huh? Hmm. (Ferb looks and sees a flower shop as she's talking) You mean like, maybe I should take an interest in his work? I would but, it's actually evil. I just can't... (She looks to see Ferb is gone) Ferb?"
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,Vanessa! We've come to rescue you!
2,54,Vanessa,"Dad? I was just gonna... Wait. What do you mean ""we""?"
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"I hitched a ride! You remember these guys, don't you?"
2,54,Major Monogram,"Hello again, young lady."
2,54,Vanessa,I can't believe you brought work with you again!
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Work? What do you... Oh, you mean them? No, Major Monobrow and Perry the Platypus, they...they were helping me find you!"
2,54,Major Monogram,Monobrow?
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on. You've got that whole thing up here, it runs right... It's one straight line, for crying out loud!"
2,54,Major Monogram,That's it. I'm getting my tweezers back from Carl.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, come on, Vanessa. I came halfway around the world to get you!"
2,54,Vanessa,Halfway?
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, halfway around the world."
2,54,Vanessa,You met me halfway.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,I suppose you could put it that way.
2,54,Vanessa,"You did, didn't you? You know what Dad, move over. I'm coming with you."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, this is great, Vanessa! Why don't we talk to these guys for giving us a tour in Paris? We could go check out the Guillotine Museum!"
2,54,Major Monogram,Gross.
2,54,Vanessa,"Bye, Ferb! Thanks for everything!"
2,54,Phineas,"Well, the baguettes are rubber banded on. That should get us across the Atlantic. Why didn't we think of that in the first place?"
2,54,Isabella,"(sarcastically) Gee, I don't know."
2,54,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. Where's Vanessa?"
2,54,Ferb,She went off with someone else.
2,54,Phineas,"That's too bad. I thought the two of you, you know, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love. I thought romance was a forgone conclusion."
2,54,Isabella,Grrrr! (Isabella looks on in surprise as he says this before finally breaking her pencil in anger)
2,54,Phineas,"(Obviously) Isabella, did you say something?"
2,54,Isabella,(Annoyed) I need a new pencil.
2,54,Phineas,"Oh, hey, Candace. So how'd it go? Did you see Jeremy?"
2,54,Candace,"Well, I saw him. I just didn't talk to him."
2,54,Phineas,"Oh, that's too bad. I thought, you know, the two of you, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love..."
2,54,Isabella,"Grrrr! (Isabella reacts the same way as before but instead of breaking her pencil, her head explodes)"
2,54,Phineas,Isabella?!
2,54,Phineas,"Isabella, are you okay?"
2,54,Isabella,(annoyed) Peachy.
2,54,Phineas,"So, what happened?"
2,54,Candace,"Well, you know when you know someone, and you see that they have another, like, life away from you and it feels weird?"
2,54,Phineas,Like when you see your teacher in the grocery store weird? Or like when someone you've known for a long time starts wearing a cowboy hat weird?
2,54,Candace,The...the first thing weird.
2,54,Phineas,That's good. 'Cause I was thinking about getting the cowboy hat.
2,54,Candace,It's just... Jeremy looked like he was having a really good time here. And it suddenly seem creepy and obsessive that I came all this way. What if he doesn't wanna see me? Or came to Paris to get away from me?
2,54,Phineas,"Candace, like the song said, you have to believe you can!"
2,54,Baljeet,I think Candace may have missed that song.
2,54,Buford,"Yeah, man, she was in the house!"
2,54,Phineas,What?! You missed Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan?!
2,54,Candace,Uhh...apparently.
2,54,Phineas,"Well, that's too bad. But the jist of it was that you gotta believe in yourself."
2,54,Candace,"Well, that's easy for you, Phineas! Look at all the things you've done. Summer belongs to you."
2,54,Phineas,Summer doesn't belong to me. It belongs to everyone! And that includes you. You have to believe that.
2,54,Candace,"Well, my summer's been a series of failures. (Sadly) I have a hard time believing in anything."
2,54,Phineas,"Well...you got on this plane. You know, back when it WAS a plane. Which means you believe in us!"
2,54,Ferb,And we believe in you.
2,54,Phineas,"And therefore, through the transitive property of belief, you do believe in yourself!"
2,54,Candace,I do?
2,54,Phineas,"Besides, when we did all those things, you were right there with us!"
2,54,Candace,"I was, wasn't I?"
2,54,Phineas,Yes! You're Candace Flynn! Monster truck driver. Charioteer. Queen of Mars!
2,54,Candace,"Well, I am Candace Flynn."
2,54,Phineas,That's the spirit!
2,54,Candace,You're right. I'm Candace Flynn! Lifeguard!
2,54,Phineas,"That's right, Candace!"
2,54,Candace,(She starts climbing on the plane) Time traveler!
2,54,Phineas,Don't break the engine!
2,54,Candace,(She stands on top of the engine before shouting) I am Candace Flynn! Cou de Crayon!
2,54,Jeremy,Candace?
2,54,Candace,Jeremy?!
2,54,Jeremy,It is you! I was just over there in the taxi and I saw you over... What are you doing here?
2,54,Candace,"Well, my brothers have this idea of flying over..."
2,54,Jeremy,Your brothers? Say no more.
2,54,Phineas,"Oops, we slipped our mooring. Guess we're leaving. Hey Candace, better wrap it up! Looks like we're on our way."
2,54,Candace,"What? No, not yet! I have something I wanted to tell you!"
2,54,Jeremy,"Really, what is it?"
2,54,Candace,"I wanted to tell you earlier but then I saw you in front of your hotel, with those kids, and the girl with the ice cream..."
2,54,Jeremy,"Candace, were you spying on me?"
2,54,Candace,"No, no, it's just that I saw you and it was like...it was like my teacher wearing a cowboy hat!"
2,54,Jeremy,I would hope my girlfriend would have a little trust in me.
2,54,Candace,(Shocked) Jeremy... You said the G-word!
2,54,Jeremy,"Well, yeah, I used the...oh...ugh, hold on! (He runs to the opposite side of the bridge) Yeah, I used the G-word. It doesn't freak you out, does it?"
2,54,Candace,"No, because I think of you as my B-word."
2,54,Jeremy,"Well, G-word. You want a K-word?"
2,54,Candace,"Heheheh, maybe?"
2,54,Jeremy,Uhh...Candace?
2,54,Candace,"All set, Jeremy! Start kissin'!"
2,54,Jeremy,Candace...!
2,54,Candace,"(Opens her eyes and sees that he's too far away) No, no, no, no, no, no!"
2,54,Jeremy,"W-Wait, you can't leave now! You would...just get off on the next bridge!"
2,54,Candace,"I can't, I'm in charge of these guys. I-I gotta be responsible. I'll see you in a week, boyfriend!"
2,54,Phineas,"Candace, you better take your seat."
2,54,Isabella,"Don't worry, Candace. The week will be over before you know it. (A bit bitterly) At least you got a love scene on a bridge."
2,54,Buford,"""Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by the imagination."""
2,54,Baljeet,"Voltaire, Buford? Really?"
2,54,Buford,"Oh, I can't help it. Paris does it to me every time."
2,54,Phineas,"It's four o'clock, we're on a baguette boat, with a fuel tank filled with snail grease. I have a good feeling about this. Okay everyone, hold on to something!"
2,54,Phineas,"Ohohoh, YEEAH!"
2,54,Mime,(Gets splashed by water as the plane zooms past) Hey everyone! I can talk!
2,54,Phineas,"We're almost to Le Havre harbour, Ferb. After that, it's nothing but an open ocean and a couple of remote islands! We should be home in no time! (He notices a huge ship blocking the way) Huh, well that might be a problem."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"(On the hovercraft) Hey, check it out! It's my giant water balloon!"
2,54,(Song,"""Follow the Sun"")"
2,54,Sailor 1,Would you look at that. Five kids in a jet-powered baguette boat in the middle of the Atlantic.
2,54,Sailor 2,"Ahh, that reminds me of Karen Johnson."
2,54,Sailor 1,Everything reminds you of Karen Johnson.
2,54,Sailor 2,I hate being a sailor.
2,54,(Song continuation,)
2,54,Phineas,"Well, looks like everything worked out the best! That giant wave put us back on schedule. We may even arrive in Danville ahead of time. You know, barring any foreseen mishaps. (The stirring wheel suddenly breaks off) Oh, like that. That's what I'm talking about. (The engine breaks) And that. (Another part breaks off) And that. (The baguettes fall off) And that. (Everything breaks except for the seats) This is all exactly what I was talking about earlier."
2,54,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, that was our worst landing yet. I'm beginning to detect a pattern here."
2,54,Candace,"Phineas! This isn't Danville; it's a deserted island! The only things on this island are us, a couple of trees and a big fat ox!"
2,54,Buford,Hey!
2,54,Candace,"Not you big fat ox, him big fat ox."
2,54,Candace,"When Mom and Dad left me in charge, I never took into account that we might not make it back at all! Now we're stranded, and now I'll never get my kiss from Jeremy! (She starts crying and falls to her knees) It's the end of romance! Aaagh! (She curls into a ball on the ground)"
2,54,Buford,(Laughs) You're gonna lose!
2,54,Phineas,"You do realize that you're stranded on this island too, right?"
2,54,Buford,"I don't care, I'm winning! (He laughs some more) I'm done."
2,54,Baljeet,"Phineas, how are we going to get off this island?"
2,54,Phineas,"Well, we'll just have to fix the boat!"
2,54,Candace,(Hopelessly) With what?
2,54,Phineas,"There's plenty here. All we need is our imagination! For instance, we could tie those two palm trees into a raft and add a super sonic outboard motor. Oh, wait...we don't have anything to cut the trees with and...we don't have an outboard motor. (He looks at the ox) Aaah, I know, we could soup up this ox so he could run on a conveyor belt that would charge the... Ohh, we don't have a conveyor belt and we don't have any soup."
2,54,Buford,Not to mention... You're never gonna make it!
2,54,Phineas,"We'll make it! After all, we've got... Uhh... (He looks around) We've got the seats! We've still got one rubber band! And we've got... (He looks at the ground after seeing nothing else before he picks up handfuls of sand) We've got sand!"
2,54,Buford,"Hey, maybe you could make an hourglass and watch the time slip away."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, thanks for the lift."
2,54,Major Monogram,"Before you leave, we have one more thing for you."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,Really? What is it?
2,54,Major Monogram,Those are handcuffs.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,I know what handcuffs are. I'm not an idiot! (to Perry) And not one word outta you.
2,54,Major Monogram,"Well, there's a list of outstanding violations as long as your arm."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Ohh, well, I do have unusually long arms."
2,54,Vanessa,But we're on vacation!
2,54,Major Monogram,"Oh, don't worry young lady. You'll be able to continue your vacation in 10–20 years."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"I'm gonna beat the rap, though. I've been working on a rap-beat-inator. I just don't know if it works in France. I mean, if you see the electrical outlets here, I wouldn't even know where to start."
2,54,Vanessa,Hold it right there! (She holds up what looks like a ray of some sort) Step away from the evil scientist!
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,Vanessa! I'm so proud of you! You are evil!
2,54,Vanessa,I'm not evil. Just get in the car before they find out this is only a hair dryer.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,This is a hair dryer?
2,54,Vanessa,Yeah. I got it in Tokyo.
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,"Cool! But they didn't know it was a hair dryer when you pointed it at them, so...that means you're little evil!"
2,54,Vanessa,"Okay, Dad. Maybe I'm a little evil."
2,54,Doofenshmirtz,I knew it! (He cries in joy) That's okay... I'm not gonna cry...
2,54,Vanessa,Dad.
2,54,Major Monogram,"Well, guess we could kiss that pair of handcuffs good bye. I don't about you, but I'm gonna go take in a review. See you back in the States."
2,54,Phineas,"(Desperately) There, There's got to be some minerals or something down here that we can use! I mean, we can't...we can't just be stuck here!"
2,54,Isabella,"Thanks, Ferb. I just don't know what to do, I mean...we were in Paris! The most romantic city in the world, and... (She sobs) he didn't even notice me! (She blows in the handkerchief) I just feel like giving up, and look at him!"
2,54,Phineas,"Look! A sponge and a starfish! There's gotta be something we can make out of this! Ah! Oh no, that's ridiculous! (He tosses them before going back down in the hole)"
2,54,Isabella,It's as if I don't exist! I would give anything if he would just sit down with me and enjoy this beautiful sunset.
2,54,Phineas,"(Desperately) We, we, we could—We, we we could dig a tunnel under the ocean and then we could, uh, we could...we can, we can...we...we can't. I can't...I can't believe there's nothing we can do to get off of this... (He sighs before he sits beside Isabella and says sadly) I guess at least we can sit and watch this beautiful sunset."
2,54,Isabella,No.
2,54,Phineas,What?
2,54,Isabella,"(She stands) No, you are not going to enjoy this beautiful sunset!"
2,54,Phineas,I'm not?
2,54,Isabella,You built a rollercoaster through downtown! You made giant tree-house robots! You traveled through time for crying out loud! Twice!
2,54,Phineas,"But, Isabella, there's nothing here for me to work with."
2,54,Isabella,"Well, that's not the Phineas Flynn that I fell in...(She pauses, and quickly rephrases what she was going to say) to...this...situation with. You showed us all in Ferb's map how this is possible and I'm not gonna let you sit there and --"
2,54,Phineas,"Ferb's map! (He jumps up) That's it! Isabella, you're the best! (He hugs her before turning to Ferb, unknowingly leaving Isabella in a trance) Hey Ferb. Let's see that map again."
2,54,Phineas,"Okay. We're here, and we need to go there. And we've got about... I'd say eleven minutes. Isabella, grab Madagascar and bring it over here to Ohio. Now Candace, you grab the Andes and fold it over the Main Greenland."
2,54,Candace,"You know, folding the map doesn't actually make these places closer together."
2,54,Phineas,"I know, I know! Crease it here. Buford, Australia over to Africa. Baljeet, Hawaii to Japan. (Baljeet pulls the map) No, no, East, East! Don't go West, you'll rip it! All right...now fold it here. Buford, one more crease down this line."
2,54,Candace,Phineas.. I don't see how an origami unicorn is getting us off this island!
2,54,Phineas,"It's not done yet, it needs one more fold. (He makes the last fold) There you go! Now wait..."
2,54,Candace,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! There's no way I'm getting on that plane!"
2,54,Phineas,"Wait, wait. It's gonna work, you'll see!"
2,54,Isabella,I think it's beautiful.
2,54,Candace,"Don't encourage him. (to Phineas) Phineas, this is crazy!"
2,54,Phineas,(He grabs the rubber band and puts it around the two trees) Car-salesman crazy or mattress-salesman crazy?
2,54,Candace,I don't know... Neither!
2,54,Phineas,"That's a relief. Isabella, Baljeet, get the seats!"
2,54,Isabella,You got it!
2,54,Phineas,"Buford, grab the ox!"
2,54,Buford,(Lifting the ox) This is the only way I'll actually hold him.
2,54,Candace,"Phineas, it's made of paper!"
2,54,Phineas,So was the Declaration of Independence!
2,54,Candace,"Yeah, but it wouldn't fly over 2,000 miles of water! Buford, why are you helping?"
2,54,Buford,(carrying the ox) How often do you get to lift an ox?
2,54,Candace,Have I taken crazy pills?! There's no engine!
2,54,Phineas,"True, but we do have this rubber band made of super special den-si-ty!"
2,54,Isabella,"Just believe we can, Candace!"
2,54,Baljeet,Yes. Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan cannot both be wrong.
2,54,Candace,"Look, apparently I missed some big musical number with Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan, okay? So can we please stop using that as a reference?!"
2,54,Baljeet,"Well, it was just very inspirational."
2,54,Candace,I'm not getting on that plane!
2,54,Phineas,"Candace, you won't see Jeremy again 'till we get off the island."
2,54,Candace,(She thinks) I get a window seat!
2,54,Buford,"You know, my horoscope said I would be riding an ox today. But I thought that was a figure of speech!"
2,54,Phineas,"A little bit further... A little bit further... Okay, that'll have to do. We're almost out of time; everybody on the plane!"
2,54,Phineas,Everyone ready? It's now or never!
2,54,Candace,"Actually Phineas, I-I changed my mind. I wanna stay here."
2,54,Phineas,"Oh, that's just the mortal terror talking."
2,54,Candace,"Well, yeah...that's what I was..."
2,54,Phineas,"Buford, pull the release!"
2,54,Buford,"Whatever, dude. It's not gonna --"
2,54,Phineas,It's working! Look!
2,54,Buford,"Yes, yes, yes!"
2,54,Baljeet,What are you so happy about?
2,54,Buford,I finally ate a bug!
2,54,Phineas,It looks like we're gonna make it! There's the Tri-State Area!
2,54,Substitute teacher announcer,Welcome to the 27th annual Substitute Teacher Day. We begin by...
2,54,Substitute teacher announcer,"All right, who's the wise guy?"
2,54,Phineas,"Hang on, everyone! We're coming in!"
2,54,Phineas,"Actually, that's probably our best landing of the day. Great, the sun's still up and we're only five blocks away. Come on!"
2,54,Isabella,Oh no! Road construction!
2,54,Phineas,It took mom an hour get around that ditch!
2,54,Isabella,There's only 58 seconds 'til sundown!
2,54,Baljeet,What kind of watch is that?
2,54,Buford,"No, no, no! Ohh, I actually thought we're gonna make it! I thought we were gonna do the impossible. For one shining moment...summer was whatever I wanted to make of it! Wait...this is my house! Hold on one second! I'm givin' everybody back their bikes!!"
2,54,Phineas,"But Buford, we didn't make it back to our yard. (Sees a ramp on the construction) I get it! Everybody, get your bikes!"
2,54,Buford,"Here's Ferb's, here's Phineas's, here's Isabella's... And here's, uh... A recumbent? Really?"
2,54,Baljeet,Studies say it is better for your back.
2,54,Buford,How come I don't have to stand in line to bully you?
2,54,Candace,"Wait, Buford never took my bike."
2,54,Buford,Noted.
2,54,Phineas,There's one right there!
2,54,Candace,"Phineas, I'm not gonna get on a silly little tricycle."
2,54,Phineas,"Candace, we're in a hurry. Just get on the trike, and we'll..."
2,54,Candace,There's no way I'm gonna--
2,54,Phineas,(angrily) GET ON THE TRIKE!!!
2,54,Candace,"Phineas, there's no way we're gonna clear that!"
2,54,Phineas,"Just believe we can, Candace!"
2,54,Candace,Is that another Chaka Khan reference? Because I thought I was clear...
2,54,Phineas,"You don't have to hear the song, Candace, you just have to believe!"
2,54,Isabella,I believe!
2,54,Baljeet,I believe!
2,54,Buford,I believe!
2,54,Candace,Okay...I belieeeeeeve!!
2,54,Linda,What a long day. It seem like the sun would never go down.
2,54,Ginger,Where are they?
2,54,Gretchen,"Don't worry, they'll make it."
2,54,Milly,Seven seconds 'till sundown!
2,54,Holly,Maybe it'll help if we count!
2,54,Fireside Girls,Five! Four! Three! Two!
2,54,Phineas,ONE!
2,54,Singers,♪ Cause you believe we can... ♪
2,54,Phineas,"Yeah! We did it! Oh my gosh, that was so great!"
2,54,Isabella,(She hugs Phineas) You guys are amazing!
2,54,Phineas,"Mom, Dad!"
2,54,Linda,"Oh, for us? That is so nice. And Candace, so responsible. Not a single phone call."
2,54,Candace,"Well, I didn't have international coverage."
2,54,Linda,What?

2,40,Candace,I would have thought it would have been understood.
2,40,Phineas,"What the heck are you doing, anyhow?"
2,40,Candace,I'm training for this year's father daughter picnic competition. And I'd really like to win for a change.

2,40,Lawrence,Dada!
2,40,Major Monogram,"We can't let the family see him like this, he's got the brain of a toddler. We need to restore his memory before he's missed at the Father Daughter Picnic."

2,59,Bridgette,And that's how socks sometimes get lost in the dryer. (pause) And cut tape.
2,59,Candace,I'm B.L.A.R.F.-ing! I'm B.L.A.R.F.-ing!
2,59,Cameraman,What was that?
2,59,Bridgette,"I don't know, but it's more interesting than socks. To the news van!"
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"And we're back. The Inator Corporation was generous enough to send us a giant check for twenty three dollars. Thank you, Sid and the guys. You do an important job. (pause) That brings our tally up to..."
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"Twenty three dollars! Uh, let's go to the phones again. (pause) Okay, if no one calls in the next few seconds, the platypus gets it!"
2,59,Announcer,We preempt this current preemption to bring you another preemption.
2,59,Bridgette,"This is Bridgette Oshinomi in the news breaker van, we're following an out of control All Terrain Vehicle that is barraling on down Broad Street."
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"This is what preempted me! Ugh! The newspeople, they're behind this, and I won't stand for it!"
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,I must destroy them! (riding hovercraft) NOTHING cuts into MY television face time!
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, haha, very funny! Everyone's a comedian."
2,59,Bridgette,The vehicle looks to be filled with children.
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,Good thing I installed a TV screen so I can follow the live coverage. Here's for stealing my ratings! (fires rays at the news van)
2,59,Bridgette,Whoa!
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I keep missing!"
2,59,Candace,B.L.A.R.F.! B.L.A.R.F.! B.L.A.R.F.!
2,59,Bridgette,"What is going on up there? Are you getting this, Don?"
2,59,Don,"(driving helicopter) We're right above you. Brigitte, have you seen something kinda strange up here?"
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, hey, it's me. It's me. I'm back. Perry the Platypus, look, the -- oh, oh, it's the chopper cam. (singsong) Hello? I'm back. Hi, hi, Mom. Hi."
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, going back to the more dramatic wide angle shot --"
2,59,Doofenshmirtz,"And the final tally is...unbearable pain. And, probably a herniated disc."
2,59,Bridgette,And...cut tape.
2,59,Candace,"You stay right here, I'm gonna go get Mom."
2,59,Kids,Okay!
2,59,Candace,Mom?!
2,59,Candace,"Mom, Mom, you've gotta come outside! I just drove up in this craaaazy souped up car that the boys invent --"
2,59,Linda,"Wait, wait, wait. You were -- driving -- without adult supervision?"
2,59,Candace,"Well, no, I was operating a remote."
2,59,Linda,"Oh, so it was a toy car."
2,59,Candace,"No, no. No, it's a full-sized, and it's --"
2,59,Linda,"You were driving a full-sized car?! Oh, that's it, young lady! You're...GROUNDED!"
2,59,Candace,"But, but, but, the boys --"
2,59,Linda,"Candace, GO TO YOUR ROOM! We will talk about this, later."
2,59,Candace,(stomps off) Ugh!
2,59,Candace,"I thought I did it right this time! Only I'd stay til the end of that seminar! Wait, Stacy's been there all day. (dials phone and laughs chaotically) Stacy!"
2,59,Stacy,"Candace, what happened to you? The lecture's over. The gift bags were totally cruddy, by the way. It's just a bag, nothing in it."
2,59,Candace,"Stacy, you've gotta tell me the last step to achieving successes. The boys' ATV is still here, I still have a chance."
2,59,Stacy,"Hmm, the last step, I forget. Hey, Chad, do you remember what the last step to achieving your goal thingy is?"
2,59,Chad,Yes. It's F.R.E.E.P.O.
2,59,Stacy,"Candace, it's F.R.E.E.P.O. See ya! (hangs up)"
2,59,Candace,"Stacy, hello? But what does that mean? What does it stand for?"
2,59,Ferb,"You know, technically we didn't try all terrain."
2,59,Candace,"Uh, F.R.E.E.P.O., uh, Frequent Rampages Encourages Enormous Perpendicular Octagons. Uh, Free Raccoons Enter Existential Plastic Origami. Oh..."
2,59,Phineas,"See ya in a bit, Candace! We're going to the moon!"
2,59,Candace,"Aw, F.R.E.E.P.O."
2,58,Narrator,"This week, we ask ""Where Did They Go?"" about Pop Stars from the 80's... First up, this perky pop-star stole a One Wonder Hit by declaring ""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun."""
2,58,Candace,"Hey, she looks familiar."
2,58,Narrator,Lindana's real name is Linda Flynn-Fletcher and she's now living in the Tri-State Area.
2,58,Candace,"What? Mom, mom, mom!"
2,58,Phineas,I can't believe she didn't know that.
2,58,Candace,"Mom, mom, mom, mom! You never told me you were a pop star!"
2,58,Linda,"Oh yeah! Well, that was long before you were born. It was fun, but I was happy to give it up to raise a family."
2,58,Candace,But you were Lindana and you wanted to have fun!
2,58,Linda,"Well, now I'm Linda and I wanna stir broth."
2,58,Phineas,"(holding a cell phone) Mom, it's for you. He says he's a concert promoter."
2,58,Linda,Really?
2,58,Linda,"An '80's revival concert featuring Lindana? Well, I don't know."
2,58,Candace,Are you crazy?!? Say yes!!!
2,58,Linda,"Candace, it's been so long."
2,58,Candace,"Come on! It'll be fun! And you'll be cool! And by extension, I'll be cool! (She smiles.)"
2,58,Linda,"Oh, what the heck? (on phone) I'll do it!"
2,58,Candace,(jumping) Woohoo!
2,58,Phineas,"Way to go, Mom!"
2,58,Lawrence,"Yes, oh, yes, good on ya, honey. (chuckles)"
2,58,Linda,"Okay, then, dinner's in the oven. Just heat it up. Bye!"
2,58,Candace,(popping out of the sunroof with her fists in the air) Rock and roll!
2,58,Lawrence,"Oh, I was afraid that a day like today would come someday…today."
2,58,Phineas,"Whadaya mean, Dad?"
2,58,Lawrence,"Oh, your mother's going to meet a lot of exciting and cool people. What if I'm…I'm no longer cool enough for your mum? I'm hardly a rock star, am I? (walking away sadly) I""m afraid I'm hopelessly nerdy."
2,58,Phineas,"(to his stepbrother) You know, Dad may be a little geeky for the new century, but in the '80s, the rise of the synthesizer allowed even hopeless nerds to rock the charts."
2,58,Ferb,"Phineas, I know what we're going to do today!"
2,58,Phineas,"Yes. Yes, you do. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,58,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P, there you are. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted playing with a hoop. See what he's up to. (Perry looks scornfully at Monogram.) That's it. That's all we got."
2,58,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, (hula hooping) as you can see I've been struck by hooping fever. Go ahead, try it. (Perry starts hooping) Like this, yeah. Now do this, with your arms down. (Perry does so and the hoop traps him.) Oh, finally! My hips were about to fall off. Behold, the Alien-inator! It's a projector that will transmit holographic images of space aliens onto the steps of the Tri-State Capital. Then, when everyone is scared witless, I will emerge in my king of the aliens costume and seize control of the entire Tri-State Area. Hee hee! I'm gonna go put it on."
2,58,Phineas,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting that '80s superstar, Max Modem!"
2,58,Lawrence/Max,"You know, I feel strangely comfortable like this. But how can I be a rock star if nobody's ever heard of me?"
2,58,Phineas,We're not trying to make you into a rock star. We're trying to make you into a has-been. That's much easier.
2,58,Stage Manager,"(offscreen) Can I have Bag Your Face onstage for your sound check, please?"
2,58,Candace,"Mom, this is so cool! I've dressed like half of these people here for Halloween! So what do we do now?"
2,58,Linda/Lindana,"If I remember correctly: hair, makeup, wardrobe and a photo session."
2,58,Candace,A photo session?!
2,58,Linda/Lindana,"The life of a rock star. Oh, it does have it's charms."
2,58,Montage,"While ""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!"" plays in the background, Candace and Linda get made up. The scene transitions into a photo session. We then see Linda signing the photos of herself and Candace as Lindana. Candace then adds ""'s daughter"" and a heart to the signatures."
2,58,Doofenshmirtz,"Are you ready? Don't peek. (Doofenshmirtz appears wearing an alien costume with a small crown on its head, a cape, and an inexplicable tan.) Ta-da! What, nothing? Wow, tough room."
2,58,Phineas,"Okay, Dad, show me what you got."
2,58,Lawrence/Max,Right ho!
2,58,Phineas,Woah! Cut cut cut! That's a little too '70s for the '80s. Just check out Ferb.
2,58,Phineas,"See, Dad? It's cool to show no effort. Let the technology and machines do the work. (All three push a button on their synths adding to the bass) Primo, Dad! I think you're ready for the big time!"
2,58,Lawrence/Max,Correction: I am ready to have once been part of the big time.

2,58,Lindana,"I don't know, but he does seem kind of familiar in a nerdy sort of way."
2,58,Doofenshmirtz,"Alright, Perry the Platypus, (leading his nemesis to the inator) let's start by placing you right here. There you go. And then, I'll set the timer here. Mustn't forget to open the roof; (cut to an exterior shot of D.E.I. as the roof opens) a little something we learned from the Diarrhea-inator debacle. Right, Perry the Platypus? And set the timer for ten minutes so I can get to the steps of the Tri-State Capital building in time to lead my alien army! Ha! Oh, and don't get any bright ideas about thwarting me while I'm gone, because this inator, it's got a few tricks up its sleeve."
2,58,Candace,"But I should be in the wings, Mom. The show's about to start."
2,58,Lindana,"I wouldn't be here without you, honey. You backed me up all the way. So it's only right that you should back me up onstage."

2,64,Doofenshmirtz,"So, let me tell you my evil scheme. Not too long ago, I used to sit right over there and watch free movies on the drive-in movie screen across the street. Of course, I didn't get the sound, so I'd make up my own dialogue. It was fun. (changes his tone of voice to sound gruff and deeper) Sheila, I love you, but now I have to defuse this bomb. (in normal voice) See? Good stuff! Gripping! But now look! They built a giant condominium blocking my view. I tried to make up dialogue for it... (in gruff movie voice) I'm a condominium. I'm just standing there. (In normal voice) See? Where's the fun in that? It's always the same, ""I'm a building."" There's no story. And I know what you're thinking, why not just move my armchair over to that window over there with the unblocked view? Well, then I would have to move this little table, too, and the lamp, and this is the only electrical outlet. It seems easier to get rid of the building. So, that's why I invented this: the Go-Away-inator! One blast of this ray, and that building, and everyone in it, (snaps his fingers) will instantly be transported somewhere else. Here on this wheel, I've written many undesirable locations. With a pull of this string, a site is randomly chosen, and good-bye low-rent condo, hello Hollywood high-budgets! (laughs maniacally)"

We assume Dr. Doofenshmirtz will do something to disrupt the ceremony. He's been buying up all the claw machines in the Tri-State Area.

2,63,Buford,I'm outta here.
2,63,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus. It's ironic that you look like a stuffed animal in one of those claw machine games. And by ""ironic""... (Doof pushes a button on the claw machine, and the claw grabs Perry, trapping him) I mean ""totally flat-out ronic."" And speaking of claw machines, (showing a joystick on another side of the blimp) I've gathered up all the arcade machines in the Tri-State Area to make one giant Super Claw (cut to the Super Claw under the blimp)....inator. My fascination with these started when I was just a little boy."
2,63,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) Back in Gimmelshtump, one day, when I was walking through the Claw Machine District, something caught my eye. In this machine that usually just has rocks in it, there was an actual teddy bear! Fortunately, I had with me my allowance, which I'd been saving for a whole year: one three-cent coin. I dropped it into a slot, then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! Odds were against me, but then it happened! The miracle! The claw grabbed the stuffed animal; it was mine! Then, like a knight of yore, I gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother... who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother, Roger. I was crushed as I watched Roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. And then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother, claiming both as his own, effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic."
2,63,Doofenshmirtz,"So now, with my giant claw, I will wreak vengeance on my brother, and take away his giant opera house! (Evil laugh) So, what's new with you?"
2,63,Guiserblint,And where would you like your bucket of gold?
2,63,Candace,"Yeah, just put it there at the end. (Guiserblint pours some more gold at the end of the rug. Candace takes off her shoes.) Okay, you can go now. (She lifts her dress up and runs gleefully through the coins in her bare feet. She stops and a record needle scratch is heard.) Wow, I've been given all this power and how I've chosen to use it is to run through gold coins barefoot....I'm a genius!! (runs back to the throne) Ha ha ha!"
2,63,Princess Baldegunde,"Okay, now I hammer. (clap clap) Hammer? (clap clap) Hammer?"
2,63,Baljeet,Your legs do not appear to be broken.
2,63,Princess Baldegunde,"You are right! Broken, they are not! I can be fetching hammer for myself, can I not? (runs off) Here I go! Never so much fun have I had!"
2,63,Phineas,Wow! Candace really seems to be enjoying herself today.
2,63,Ferb,And she seems to have acquired an upper-class Drusselsteinian speech pattern.
2,63,Phineas,Yeah. Let's just go with it.
2,63,Doofenshmirtz,"♪ Going to the Opera House, WOOT! WOOT! ♪ C'mon, Perry, sing along! (Perry buries himself among the stuffed animals) W-W-Wait. What are you doing? (Perry sticks his arm out of the prize slot and pulls a lever) Whoa! (The blimp tips over along with the claw machine, and Perry escapes.) Got to reach controls...WOOT! WOOT! (He grabs the lever and tips the blimp back upright) See? Everything works with the woots. (Perry jumps onto the joystick and grabs it) Hey! Hey, le-leggo of that! WOOT! WOOT! See, I'm tellin' ya."

2,63,Candace,"(approaching her mother) Mom! Mom! Giant jukebox! Come on! Come on! (Candace runs outside to see the blimp take the jukebox. Linda follows.) You missed it. Giant jukebox, doppelgänger, everything, all gone."
2,63,Linda,Cool.
2,63,Guiserblint,"To celebrate ze linking of the two cultures and ze lifetime achievements of Roger Doofenshmirtz, vill you please join me in velcoming Princess Baldegunde of Drusselstein!"

Instead, I give to you... (she runs up to the top of the roof with a quarter in her hand, which she shows) twenty-five American cents!

2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"(voiceover) PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT! I traveled there to, you know, discover the hidden secrets of the PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT! And then it hit me! The answer to my quest was staring me in the face. Hidden in those hieroglyphics was a seemingly random series of musical notes. You see, the PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT! were built with the help of alien intelligence. The Egyptians learned how to play a cryptic guitar solo that would summon an alien armada to help them perform feats of mind-blowing power."
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"That mystical melody is now in my very hands. And once I learn to play it, I can summon the aliens to me and I will become overlord of the TRI-STATE AREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"

2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Is he fierce, cunning, and good with a grappling hook?"
2,48,Jeremy,"Oh, no. Their platypus doesn't do much. (Perry jumps out of the building and takes a plunger and sticks it onto the bottom of the ""nose"" of the building.) Well, let's take another shot at learning this solo. (Doof plays the riff better.) Hey, doc, not bad. I think you might be getting it!"

2,48,Phineas and Isbaella,Whoa! (They run away but Ferb stays put.)
2,48,Phineas,"Ferb, what are you doing? Wait a minute. (Ferb opens the bag he's holding and takes out a mushroom, which Steve eats.) It's just Steve! Wow! How did he turn into a dinosaur?"
2,48,Isabella,"Actually, it's just a giant chameleon."
2,48,Phineas,"But ""dinosaur"" sounds cooler."
2,48,Candace,"Stupid errands. (The car shakes.) Huh? (A la that famous dinosaur movie, Candace looks in the side-view mirror and sees Steve with the others.) What? AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
2,48,Phineas,I get it. The sound of Candace's scream freaks him out.

2,48,Isabella,There's no way we can catch him. He moves too fast. Maybe we should just give up.
2,48,Ferb,"Give up?!? Give up?!? The day may come when we'll give up on fruitless searches after a mere eleven minutes, but that day is not today! The day may come when our favorite reptile may be lost from our memories and his enduring love of mushrooms forgotten, but that day is not today! (At this point, several passersby gather around to hear this speech.) Today we search! We will search for him in the streets, we will search for him in the trenches, we will search for him in the alleys and the mini-malls and the cul-de-sacs of this fair land. We'll search for him in the multilevel car parks and municipal recreational facilities. (A truck labeled British Imports with a Union Jack on it drives up behind him, giving the appropriate patriotic feel.) And we few. We happy few. We small band of brothers — and girl from across the street. We shall not cease 'til he is found!"
2,48,All,Yaaaaaaay!!!!
2,48,Policeman,We'll help ya find your friend! What does he look like?
2,48,Phineas,He's a giant lizard about 40 feet tall.
2,48,Man,...Oh. You could have mentioned that up front.
2,48,Man 2,"Yeah, count me out."
2,48,Man 3,You're on your own.
2,48,Isabella,"Steve! Steve, where are you?!"
2,48,Jeremy,You're really rockin' now!
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"The spaceships should be here any minute. And then, it will be time to pump up the volume!"
2,48,Jeremy,"(looks at his watch) Well, that's the hour. I'm gonna pack up my gear. I got another lesson across town."
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, but the aliens are on their way."
2,48,Jeremy,(offscreen) Okay. Tell them I said hi.
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"They're almost here. Oh, look, here they come! Perfect! The crescendo of all my— (Perry finally arrives on cue) Ah, Perry the Platypus. You don't stand a chance against my awesome heavy metal gear! (He presses a wawa pedal and the amp next to him releases a trap.) Ha ha! Get it? Get it? Heavy metal. Like it's...? Ah."
2,48,Phineas and Isabella,Steve?
2,48,Steve 1,Yes?
2,48,Phineas,Sorry. Wrong Steve.
2,48,Phineas and Isabella,"Steve, where are you?!"
2,48,Steve 2,(behind a newsstand) Right here. How can I help ya?
2,48,Phineas,"Uh, I don't think you're the Steve we're looking for."
2,48,Steve 2,You might wanna check at the Steve Convention.
2,48,Steve 3,"Hey, Steve!"
2,48,Steve 4,"Cool name, Steve!"
2,48,Steve 5,"Hey, Steve-a-rino!"
2,48,Phineas,Hmm... (looks one way and smiles) Steve!
2,48,All Steves,What?
2,48,Phineas,"No, no, not you. That Steve."
2,48,Steve 6,Aaah! Steve is a giant monstrous dinosaur!
2,48,Phineas,"Huh, I guess they don't like chameleons. Nice to see you again, Steve old boy. (The guitar riff is heard in the distance. Steve looks at it and sees that the amplifinator looks like a giant mushroom. He tramples over to the ""mushroom"".)"
2,48,Phineas,"No, wait! Come back!"
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Nothing can stop me now! My alien friends, I command you to— (Steve's monstrous hand grabs the ""mushroom"".) No! Oh, stop! Aaah! (Perry comes out of his trap) This is not working the way it did on paper!"
2,48,Jeremy,"Um, do you wanna pay by cash or check?"
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,Maybe I could trade you for some evil lessons?
2,48,Jeremy,I'll take cash.
2,48,Phineas and Isabella,Whoa! Woohoo!
2,48,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry! Alright, Steve, let's go home."
2,48,Candace,(offscreen) Mom thinks I'm imagining the whole thing! (Cut to Candace's bedroom where she is on the phone and holding a glass of water.) And I know Phineas and Ferb are behind this. (She sets the glass down. It begins to shake just like in the movie.) Huh? (Steve's giant eye appears in the window behind her. She runs downstairs.) MOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!
2,48,Phineas,"Thanks, Steve. (Steve's stomach growls again)"
2,48,Isabella,Sounds like he's still hungry.
2,48,Phineas,"Don't worry, big guy. We'll be right back with some food."
2,48,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, what's the point? I'm just going to sit here in the dark and rethink my life. (He flicks the ""light switch"" off and the Gigantinator reactivates.) Whoops, heh-heh. Wrong switcher. Y'know, I—I can see how that would be confusing."
2,48,Candace,"(zipping out the door with her mother) Look, Mom! See it?! Look at the gigantic dinosaur!"
2,48,Linda,"(looks down at Steve) Uh-huh, don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration?"
2,48,Candace,But but but... (sadly walks away)
2,48,Phineas,"(coming out carrying a giant bag of mushrooms with Ferb) Hi, Mom! Hey, looks like Steve's looking like his old self again."
2,48,Linda,So this is your new pet dinosaur?
2,48,Phineas,"Well, it's actually a chameleon. You said we could keep him, right?"
2,48,Linda,Of course. I'm sure he'll blend right in. (Steve goes into Ferb's hand and disappears again.)
2,48,Jeremy,"Okay, Mr. Monogram, now this is a G-chord."
2,48,Major Monogram,"Uh, actually, it's Major Monogram. You see, I'm in charge of an elite group of secret agent undercover animals who— (clears throat) You don't mind me going on about this, do ya?"
2,48,Jeremy,"Hey, man, I charge by the hour, so knock yourself out."
2,60,TV Announcer,"Are you and your family looking for a peaceful vacation getaway? Come visit delightful Danville! We've got grass, milk, and smiles! So come to Danville, pretty please? Brought to you by the Danville Tourist Board."
2,60,Phineas,"You know, begging is really unbecoming. I mean, I like smiles as much as the next guy, (Ferb smiles bizarrely) and milk is a classic. But what Danville really needs is a biiiiiig tourist attraction. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,60,Linda,"Bye, Candace! I'm off to make my rounds."
2,60,Candace,"Bye, Mom."
2,60,Candace,"Mom! Mom! Mom! (growls in frustration) I'm gonna need some backup. (Calls Stacy) Hey, Stace. Wanna come over and help me bust my brothers?"
2,60,Stacy,"Ooh, sounds like fun, but I have to go to the eye doctor."
2,60,Candace,"Okay, but just don't get big, thick glasses because then you'd be a nerd, and I couldn't be seen with you."
2,60,Stacy,"Oh, Candace. You're so shallow."
2,60,Candace,I know. I am so shallow.
2,60,Candace,"But seriously, don't get any thick, nerdy glasses. (Hangs up, hears more noises outside) Ooh, as soon as I get some help, you guys are so busted!"
2,60,Phineas,"Just dump it right there, next to the giant gorilla head."
2,60,Isabella,Hey Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
2,60,Phineas,Ferb and I have decided to construct the world's tallest building. Wanna help?
2,60,Isabella,"Sure. Who wouldn't want to be a part of the ""Phineas and Ferb"" project?"
2,60,Albert,Phineas and Ferb? Pish-tosh! I'll take ninja discipline over creative whimsy any day.
2,60,Irving,"Well, I just think that--"
2,60,Albert,"Irving, you're my little brother. So, it's my duty to teach you all my secrets of self-defense. (Holds up a pair of nun-chucks)"
2,60,Irving,I'd rather see what Phineas and Ferb are doing.
2,60,Albert,"What's in the box, anyway?"
2,60,Irving,"It's my old collection of spy cameras. I'm going to bring them to Phineas and Ferb, and see what they can do with them."
2,60,Albert,I'll take those!
2,60,Irving,"Give them back, Albert!"
2,60,Albert,(Spills the box) Oopsie!
2,60,Irving,"Ooh! You pick those up, Albert!"
2,60,Albert,(Waving nun-chucks) Make me. That is if you're...ninja enough.
2,60,Irving,You're...a jerk! I'm gonna go play with Phineas and Ferb. (leaves)
2,60,Albert,Fine! Do you realize these cameras are now forfeit!
2,60,Candace,"(on her cell phone) Yeah, sure, Jenny, but what have whales ever done for me?"
2,60,Albert,"Well, hello."
2,60,Candace,"Fine; if that's the way you feel, I'll get someone else to bust my brothers."
2,60,Albert,I'll help you.
2,60,Candace,Are you talking to me?
2,60,Albert,"As a damsel in distress, I have to help you, milady. It's part of my Medieval Knight's Code."
2,60,Candace,(scoffs) I'm outta here.
2,60,Albert,But don't you wanna bust your brothers?
2,60,Candace,I'm listening.
2,60,Albert,"Well, have you considered applying the manly science of spy cameras to your problem?"
2,60,Candace,Spy cameras? Wouldn't it be easier to just show my mom what Phineas and Ferb make?
2,60,Albert,I don't know. Is that easier?
2,60,Candace,(suddenly realizing) No! No it's not easy! It's never easy! I need help.
2,60,Albert,And manly technological surveillance.
2,60,Candace,I need...nerd help. Will you help me?
2,60,Albert,You have my word. My nerd word.
2,60,Phineas,"Glad to have you on board, Irving! You can pick up your hardhat right over there next to Perry. (Camera pans to hardhats, revealing that Perry's hardhat is on the ground and he is gone) Hey, where's Perry?"
2,60,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P! It appears that Doofenshmirtz has been brushing up on his astronomy. He's rented an award-winning astronomical musical, Supernova? Fabulousnova! We don't know what it means, so we need you to get over there unrealistically fast. Good luck, Agent P! Agent P?"
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh. Perry the Platypus, why do you always rush over here just to get trapped? It makes no sense. Ya like that? It's a space helmet. I got a bunch of them used. They still smell like astronaut. I think that's what that is. Anyway, since you're here, let me tell you about my new hobby; making charts and graphs. See, this is a chart of my canteen usage! Which has plummeted since childhood. (Flips the chart to a second one) And this is my evil. I noticed that in any given month, my evilness--that's the red part--stays perfectly constant. Evenly evil. But around the same time each month, there's a spike in background evil, see that, right here? And during that part of the month I actually seem less evil by comparison! And why? Why is it? It's the full moon!"
2,60,(Song,Keep on Building)
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"So, to recap, I rotate the dark side of the lunar surface towards the Earth, eliminate the full moon and corner the market on evil! What? It's genius. Why are you looking at me like I'm an idiot? Would an idiot build...THIS? (Presses a remote control button. A curtain goes up, revealing a cork with a jellybean taped to it) Oh wait wait, not that, that's just a cork taped to a jellybean...but don't judge it, it's a layered idea. Now behold, the Lunar Rotat-inator! (Pans to outside Doof Inc. Penthouse ceiling rolls back to reveal nothing) Oh wait, wait, it's not up there yet, hold on. Okay, wait, wait, almost there. (The inator rises into view) Okay, there! Now you can behold!"
2,60,Albert,"Camera one is in position and activated. As soon as the other sixteen cameras are in place, we can render the whole take-down in three dimensions. And busting your brothers will be as simple as a quadratic equation."
2,60,Candace,"For a nerd, you rock!"
2,60,Irving,Albert and Candace and spy cameras? So that's your game.
2,60,Isabella,"Hey Phineas, how are we going to know when to stop building?"
2,60,Phineas,I guess we'll just know when we get there.
2,60,Ferb,We're there.
2,60,Phineas,"That's one small step for Ferb, one giant building for Danville!"
2,60,Candace,"(looking into the truck's backseat area, which is not shown) So, your father's an exterminator?"
2,60,Albert,No. Why do you ask?
2,60,Candace,(uneasily) No reason.
2,60,Albert,Now sit back and watch the magic unfold.
2,60,Candace,"Not much of a nerd, are ya?"
2,60,Albert,Someone has purloined our cameras!
2,60,Irving,"(from atop a ledge on the building. He is holding the missing cameras by their wires) Hey, Albert! Looking for these?"
2,60,Albert,IRRRVIIING! You bring those back down here right this instant!
2,60,Irving,"(tauntingly) Ooh. Why don't you come up here, and endeavor to reclaim them?"
2,60,Albert,WE SHALL!
2,60,Candace,"Actually, I don't do high places."
2,60,Albert,I SHALL!
2,60,Albert,IRVING!
2,60,Irving,"(as he rides the rollercoaster) Hey, Albert! Pretty neat, huh? Just another creative whimsy from the minds of Phineas and Ferb!"
2,60,Irving,(condescendingly) And you want to bust them. (He takes off again)
2,60,Albert,I do if you like them! (He jumps into another set of cars and takes off after Irving)
2,60,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
2,60,Phineas,"(from behind Albert in another car) Hey, Albert! Enjoying the monorail?"
2,60,Albert,"Yeah, well, I was in the neighborhood, and I--OH MY GO-OSH!"
2,60,Phineas,"This is our chess floor. And up here, we have the Medieval Renaissance Fair floor."
2,60,Albert,Huz-zah!
2,60,Phineas,"The new-in-the-box action figure floor. The M.C. Escher floor. And this is the... Oh, that's right, we sublet this floor."
2,60,Ferb,That was a mistake.
2,60,Office Guy,"(to Office Woman) So, what are you doing after work?"
2,60,Phineas,"The rubber ball floor! The barnyard floor! The studio audience floor! And of course there are hundreds of other floors to see, but we'll need to get you fitted for a pressure suit first."
2,60,Albert,"(Climbing out to join Irving) Thanks, guys."
2,60,Irving,(as Phineas and Ferb zoom away) So...what did you think?
2,60,Albert,I think you're right. Phineas and Ferb are certifiable geniuses.
2,60,Irving,"So, does this mean you're going to stop helping Candace?"
2,60,Albert,(gravely) I gave her my nerd word.
2,60,Irving,(shocked) You gave her your nerd word? But now you've only got two left!
2,60,Albert,"Well, that's on me. (Walks into elevator) And it's on me to see that Phineas and Ferb are busted. And so they shall....."
2,60,Albert,...a-be.
2,60,Candace,Did you get the cameras?
2,60,Albert,"No, but don't worry. I've done the math. There is no way your brothers won't be busted. Numbers don't lie. This building is so well constructed, there is not a force on this earth that can move it before your mom comes home!"
2,60,Candace,Then that's it! I win! Through the power of nerd help!
2,60,Phineas,"Hey, Candace. Working on your cackle?"
2,60,Candace,"You guys are so busted. (Linda's car horn sounds) Ooh, what's that I hear? Oh, that's right. It's the inevitable."
2,60,Phineas,Oh. (pause) I thought it was Mom's car.
2,60,Candace,(runs from yard) Mom! Mom! Mom!
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,Wha?
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Ha! I told you it was a layered idea! Now, to show the moon who's boss!"
2,60,Phineas,Huh. I don't remember adding that.
2,60,Candace,Mom! Mom! Giant building!
2,60,Linda,"Just a sec, Candace. Let me grab these groceries. (As the giant building narrowly misses them as it rotates over them) Aaand...there we go. Now what were you saying?"
2,60,Candace,(With her eyes closed) Look!
2,60,Phineas,"Hi, Mom!"
2,60,Linda,"Oh, hi, boys. What did you do today?"
2,60,Phineas,We tried to make Danville a more interesting place.
2,60,Linda,"Well, you guys do that just by being you."
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait, this doesn't make any sense. The moon is rotating, but the dark side isn't moving. Ohhh, I bet you had something to do with this. Didn't you, Perry the Platypus? You're always messing me up. You're mean. Mean, Perry the Platypus, born mean, that's all. Wait, what are you doing? Making magic fingers at me? Wha--are you even listening to me?"
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, this isn't big enough to trap me!...CURSE YOU, GIANT FLYING BUILDING!"
2,60,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, oh, now I think I get it! The light from the moon is just a reflection of the light from the sun! Ah, dummkopf!"
2,60,(Song,Keep on Building)
2,61,Candace,"I don't know, Stacy, between busting my brothers and trying to make Jeremy my boyfriend in time for school, I just can't seem get anything this summer. Like my ""Jeremy and Me"" scrapbook. I mean, I have cute pictures of Jeremy and cute pictures of me, but no cute pictures of both of us being cute together! It's a real problem. But time to check on Phineas and Ferb!"
2,61,Candace,"Standing around, dorking it up, boring. There's just too much for one person to do. If only there were two of me, one to bust my brothers and one to be with Jeremy."
2,61,Buford,Look what Baljeet did to my candy bar. He got peanut butter on my chocolate. Look at this mess! Look at it! (shoves the candy bar in Phineas's face)
2,61,Phineas,"Buford, peanut butter and chocolate are really good together."
2,61,Buford,I don't wanna taste two things at one time! It's unnatural.
2,61,Phineas,"Well, you're in luck. We just finished our Molecular Separator. It's our cool new machine that breaks things down into their components parts. We used it to separate a mule into a horse and a donkey. And to separate shampoo plus conditioner into shampoo and conditioner. Ferb?"
2,61,Buford,Witchcraft!
2,61,Phineas,Try it.
2,61,Phineas,Well?
2,61,Buford,Singular goodness. (To Baljeet) Why don't you grab your peanut butter and your swimsuit and meet me at the flagpole. (He and Baljeet walk away.)
2,61,Phineas,"Come on, let's see what else we can separate."
2,61,Monogram,"Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been seen at the Danville public pool, installing some kind of new device. We need you to get there immediately. Good luck, Agent P."
2,61,Candace,"Those kids are so busted! All I have to do is bring this to Mom. (tries to lift it) Wow, it's heavier than I thought."
2,61,Busting Candace,MUST...BUST...PHINEAS AND FERB.
2,61,Romantic Candace,"Ah, Jeremy."
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus, I'm glad you're here. I'm just in line for the high dive. You see, it reminds me of the high dive I knew as a kid at the Gimmelshtump Public Wetness Maker."
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(Narrating) It wasn't so much of a pool, as it was just a...we'll just say that it only had water in it on alternating Thursdays, and leave it at that."
2,61,Heinz's Father,Are you a man or a schnitzel?
2,61,Young Heinz,"I'm a man, I'm a man."
2,61,Queuing man,Das kind ist ein schnitzel. (That kid is a schnitzel!)
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(Narrating) With all those people looking and laughing at me, I-I just couldn't do it."
2,61,Heinz's Father,Ich habe keinen sohn. (I have no son.)
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(Narrating) After that, my father and I became increasingly distant."
2,61,Heinz's Father,Zu nah! (Too close!)
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, I will conquer my fear and jump from the high dive. But you know, I still don't want any of these people to look at me and make fun of me. So I invented the Look-Away-inator! You'd think it would attract a lot of attention at a public pool, but so far no one's noticed it. It must be leaking or something."
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Anyway, when I do my man making dive, you can bet that no one in the Tri-State Area will be looking. Sure, it may be tough for people who happen to be driving, plus, brain surgeons might have a problem too. But it's really a small price to pay for me becoming a man, right?"
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,You're right. I gotta trap you.
2,61,Romantic Candace,Romance! lalalalala! It's a Jeremy bedroom.
2,61,Busting Candace,O. M. G.
2,61,Busting Candace,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb made me!"
2,61,Linda,"Um, I've got some stretch marks that would say otherwise."
2,61,Busting Candace,"No, I mean, they split me in half. Well, not like I'm cut in half, but they've made another me. Hear for yourself."
2,61,Busting Candace,It's for you.
2,61,Romantic Candace,Hi Jeremy!
2,61,Busting Candace,"Not Jeremy, it's Mom."
2,61,Romantic Candace,"Oh, hi Mom. Here's Candace."
2,61,Busting Candace,See?
2,61,Linda,"(from the phone) That was a very nice imitation of yourself, Candace. Love ya, bye."
2,61,Busting Candace,"No, wait! Hello? Grrrrrr."
2,61,Phineas,"Hi Candace, and hello to you, Candace."
2,61,Phineas,"Uh-oh. Okay Ferb, change of plans."
2,61,Busting Candace,"You need to focus on what's important, you touchy-feely ninny!"
2,61,Phineas,"Hey, guys, so it appears there's been a little mishap. Let's say we fire up the ol' Molecular Splitter in reverse and..."
2,61,Busting Candace,"Forget it! I've only got one thing on my mind, and that's busting you! I'm going to the mall to get Mom."
2,61,Romantic Candace,Wait for me!
2,61,Phineas,"Well, I guess I know what we're gonna do today."
2,61,Busting Candace,Gotta find Mom.
2,61,Romantic Candace,Gotta find Jeremy.

2,61,Romantic Candace,"(dreamily) Oh, yeah."
2,61,Busting Candace,"Mom, Mom! Have you seen me?"
2,61,Linda,"Well, I see you right now. Weren't you looking for Jeremy?"
2,61,Busting Candace,No.

2,61,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
2,61,Busting Candace,Have you seen Candace?

2,61,Busting Candace,"No, no, no, no. Not ""me"" me. The ""me"" that isn't me."
2,61,Jeremy,(Confused) Uh...
2,61,Busting Candace,"You know, ""blah-blah-blah. Jeremy is so amazing. Hearts, rainbows, and unicorns, blah!"" That me."
2,61,Jeremy,"(Confused) Well, gosh. I guess I could say, yes, I have."
2,61,Busting Candace,Where?
2,61,Jeremy,"(Scared) Nowhere. I mean, not today."
2,61,Busting Candace,"Ugh! Well, if I come back and I have a flower in my hair, you tell me. Find Candace, find Mom. Bust, bust, bust."
2,61,Romantic Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
2,61,Jeremy,"Uh, hey, Candace. You have a flower in your hair."
2,61,Romantic Candace,(chuckles) I know.
2,61,Jeremy,"Okay, you're kinda scaring me."
2,61,Romantic Candace,(sighs contentedly) I could just stare at you all day long.
2,61,Jeremy,"Listen, I gotta get back to work, but if you like, I can swing by your house after I'm done."
2,61,Romantic Candace,Really? I would love that!
2,61,Jeremy,"Okay then, I'll see you after work."
2,61,Romantic Candace,"Something to remember me by? (points to her cheek, smiling)"
2,61,Jeremy,Okay.
2,61,Jeremy,"Okay, maybe later."
2,61,Phineas,"Hey, Jeremy."
2,61,Jeremy,"Hey, guys."
2,61,Phineas,Have you seen Candace?
2,61,Jeremy,"Yeah, she was just here."
2,61,Phineas,Was she talking about busting or was she oogling over you?
2,61,Jeremy,"Uh...both. She said something about going to find the ""other Candace"" and-and Mom and then she went all wild when I mentioned stopping by tonight."
2,61,Phineas,"Great! So if we just find Mom, we'll find both Candaces."
2,61,Jeremy,"(Confused) Uh, tell them I say hi."
2,61,Kid,"Mister, come on. It's your turn. Are you some kind of a schnitzel?"
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"I am a man! Not a schnitzel. (Climbing up the high dive) I will prove it right now! (scoffs) Nobody calls me schnitzel anymore! I bet he doesn't even know what it means the little... (He reaches the top) Hey, hey, wait a minute. This isn't as bad as I remember...it's so much worse! (Clings onto the diving board)"
2,61,Kid,(Flatly sighs) Schnitzel.
2,61,Busting Candace,"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! She's here! I have Candace here with me! Come out and look for yourself!"
2,61,Busting Candace,See? (Gestures next to her with eyes closed) Two of us!
2,61,Linda,"Well, actually, right now I can see four of you."
2,61,Busting Candace,That slippery vixen! Don't move. I'll be right back. (runs off)
2,61,Linda,"(sighs tiredly) Yes, yes, you will."
2,61,Busting Candace,"Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust."
2,61,Romantic Candace,My Jeremy is going to love this!
2,61,Phineas,There she is.
2,61,Linda,"Well, I'm heading out. You want a ride?"
2,61,Romantic Candace,But my sugar-boo is still...
2,61,Phineas,"Candace, isn't Jeremy coming over? You should be home getting ready."
2,61,Romantic Candace,"Oh, they're right! Mom, let's go!"
2,61,Linda,How about you kids?
2,61,Phineas,Don't worry. We'll be home soon.
2,61,Phineas,"One Candace down, one to go."
2,61,Phineas,We just saw her. She's driving away with Mom.
2,61,Phineas,"If the Molecular Splitter doesn't just disappear when this is over, we should really consider destroying it."
2,61,Ferb,Agreed.
2,61,Romantic Candace,"My Jeremy, my Jeremy, and I will be forever. My Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy will leave me never. Ooh, Jeremy. Yay, Jeremy!"
2,61,Linda,What was that noise?
2,61,Romantic Candace,Jeremy's coming! Gotta get ready for Jeremy!
2,61,Busting Candace,Where is she?
2,61,Linda,Where is who?
2,61,Busting Candace,"Candace, she was with you in the car!"
2,61,Linda,"Yes, ""she"" was."
2,61,Busting Candace,And?
2,61,Man,"Come on buddy, let's go!"
2,61,Kid,"(has climbed up the diving board) Watch out, schnitzel! (skillfully dives into the pool)"
2,61,Man,Yeah!
2,61,Kid,Boo-yah!
2,61,Woman,Now that's a man!
2,61,Phineas,"Hey, Candace, look who's here early."
2,61,Romantic Candace,Ooh! My Jeremy is here! I'll be right with you my love! (disappears from the window to rush to downstairs)
2,61,Phineas,"Wow, she bought it. (Turns around giving a thumbs up to Ferb, who is dressed up like Jeremy) I guess love is blind."
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, okay, I'll show you. My Turn-Away-inator and I are ready to go! (presses the button and everyone at the pool looks to the side, away from Doofenshmirtz) That's right, look away."
2,61,Sculptor,(Sarcastically) Fantastic.
2,61,Brain Surgeon,"Uh, has everyone paid up on their insurance bill?"
2,61,Woman,I taste lilacs.
2,61,Romantic Candace,My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here!
2,61,Busting Candace,"Busted, busted, busted, mom!"
2,61,Phineas,"Ferb, now."
2,61,Phineas,Yikes.
2,61,Linda,"All right Candace, I'm here."
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"Now I'm ready. (His head suddenly turns to the side) Oh, I didn't realize it would affect me, too! Not ready!"
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(Flailing in the water) Ah, I can't swim! I am a schnitzel! I am a schnitzel!"
2,61,Doofenshmirtz,"(Stops shouting and flailing) Curse you and thank you, Perry the Platypus."
2,61,Phineas,What are we looking at?
2,61,Ferb,I have no idea.
2,61,Linda,"I could've sworn there were more people here. What did you want, Candace?"
2,61,Candace,(Sighs) Nothing.
2,61,Linda,Suit yourself. (Leaves)
2,61,Singing Monogram,♪ I wanna sing! ♪ (Laughs)
2,61,Major Monogram,I try so hard to keep you under wraps.
2,61,Candace,"(At herself) I can't do anything right, even with two of me! I can't bust my brothers. I can't even..."
2,61,Jeremy,"There you are, Candace."
2,61,Candace,Jeremy?
2,61,Jeremy,(Holding the frame Romantic Candace had bought) Your mom said you got this for me at the mall today.
2,61,Candace,"Uh, no, I mean, that wasn't really me. I mean...not all of me. I mean...oh, this isn't coming out right."
2,61,Jeremy,"Well, I think it's pretty cool."
2,61,Candace,You do?
2,61,Jeremy,The only thing is it needs a picture. Anybody got a camera?
2,61,Phineas,We're on it.
2,61,Ferb,(Holds up a camera) Say fromage.
2,61,Candace/Jeremy,Fromage!
2,49,Phineas,"What to do, what to do?"
2,49,Isabella,"Hi, guys. What'cha doin'?"
2,49,Phineas,"Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. Hey, are you Fireside Girls missing any specific accomplishment patches?"
2,49,Isabella,"Let's see. What's next on the list? (reads a list of patches until she comes to the right one; snaps fingers) ""Rodeo Clown"" patch!"
2,49,Baljeet,What does a rodeo clown do?
2,49,Buford,"They keep the bulls from knockin' you over, like this! (knocks Baljeet over)"
2,49,Baljeet,"Oh, I can see how that would be helpful."
2,49,Phineas,"We can build mechanical bulls and have a robot rodeo. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,49,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. Seems the Tri-State Area's association of evil geniuses, the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness, is having some sort of huge gathering. All of the other agents have been deployed, but none have reported back. We fear they've been captured. Now, see what you can do, Agent P. (salutes) Monogram out."
2,49,Candace,Tiny Cowboy live in concert!
2,49,Stacy,"Um, Candace? Candace?!"
2,49,Candace,Tiny Cowboy is our favorite band ever! AHH!
2,49,Stacy,CANDACE! I can't go.
2,49,Candace,Wha...?
2,49,Stacy,It...it's my mom. She doesn't want me to go to the concert with you.
2,49,Candace,What? Doesn't she like me?
2,49,Stacy,"No, no. She likes you just fine, she just thinks...you're, I don't know, flighty and unfocused from time to time."
2,49,Candace,"""Unfocused""? What could possibly give her that... (hears motor whirring) Wait, did... did you hear that? Was that Ferb's band-saw?"
2,49,Stacy,Candace?
2,49,Candace,Yes?
2,49,Stacy,Focus.
2,49,Candace,"Oh, yeah, right."
2,49,Stacy,"Mom said if I'm going to a grown-up concert, she wants me to go with someone more...grounded and mature."
2,49,Candace,I can be grounded and mature.
2,49,Stacy,Really?
2,49,Candace,"Well, I can certainly fake it long enough to convince your mom. Remember that time I pretended to be Irish for a whole week?"
2,49,Stacy,"Indeed I do, Miss O'Flynn!"
2,49,Candace,We can do this!
2,49,Candace/Stacy,AHHHHH!
2,49,Judge,"Welcome, one and all, to the second annual Inator Creator contest. And now, please welcome last year's winner, Rodney!"
2,49,Rodney,"Thank you. Feast your eyes, boys. (reveals trophy belt) Ta-daaaa!"
2,49,Rodney,Look upon this belt of victory.
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooh, I'm taking that puppy home with me, 'cause I'll have a greater Inator this year. Not a greater, it's...I-I'm not gonna break a block of cheese and make nachos for you guys. It's-it's greater in the sense that it's better than it was last year. (pause, walks away) That's what I mean."
2,49,Stacy,"All right, let's concentrate on your look. Ta-da!"
2,49,Candace,(wearing fake glasses) But... they're just a pair of fake glasses.
2,49,Stacy,Exactly. Nothing says real focus like fake glasses.
2,49,Candace,What's that?
2,49,Ferb,"(in the background) Cowgirls and cowpokes, welcome to the Flynn-Fletcher Bros' Rodeo!"
2,49,Candace,Wait a minute! What's going on out there?
2,49,Stacy,Candace?
2,49,Candace,They'd better not be... (gasps) Feeling...busting...urge!
2,49,Stacy,"Easy, girl."
2,49,Phineas,"Great job on these cowboy hat helmets, Ferb."
2,49,Candace,A rodeo?! (dials phone) Got tell Mom!
2,49,Stacy,Wait. Following all over yourself to bust your brothers is exactly what makes you look so flighty and unfocused.
2,49,Candace,I must repress my basic urges to bust.
2,49,Stacy,"Repressing basic urges to bust is pretty responsible, isn't it?"
2,49,Candace,Is it ever! Look at my mom!
2,49,Linda,Cake is a sometimes food. Cake is a sometimes food.
2,49,Ferb,"All right, cowboys and cowgirls, it's time to get along, little doggy. Or even a short little doggy. I'm here all week. Try the veal!"
2,49,(Song,Robot Rodeo)
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Finally, Perry the Platypus! All the other animal agents were here on time before they got captured. I'm just saying. It's embarrassing. Anyway, join your friends in the inhospitality suite! (tosses Perry into metal container) Ha ha! Oh, and Perry the..."
2,49,Rodney,"Heinz, stop monologuing with your nemesis and show us that supposed Inator of yours already! (to his cronies) Doofy rented a private room off the convention floor, because he's still working on his! (they laugh)"
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Laugh enough, now, Rodney, but soon, you'll be crying like a...uh, like a...like a...something that's cries."
2,49,Rodney,Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo!
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"OH, he makes me so angry! I'm... uh, because he's so right! I need time to finish my Inator! All I've got so far is the fog machine and that's just to add some ""pizazz"" to the presentation. I could turn it on and fog out the whole contest, but all that would do is buy me some time...hey!"
2,49,Stacy,"Okay, shoulders back."
2,49,Candace,Check!
2,49,Stacy,Steady walk?
2,49,Candace,Check.
2,49,Stacy,Serious look.
2,49,Candace,"Check! Uh, Stacy?"
2,49,Stacy,Yes?
2,49,Candace,I'm feeling the busting urge.
2,49,Phineas,"Howdy, Candace! Enjoying the rodeo?"
2,49,Candace,Uhhhh!
2,49,Stacy,"Eyes on the prize, Candace, stay in character."
2,49,Linda,I'm sure your mom let you go to a concert by yourself when you were a teenager.
2,49,Dr. Hirano,Mmm...no.
2,49,Candace,"Ahem. Good afternoon, Mother. Good afternoon, Dr. Hirano. Pardon the interruption, but is there any tediously responsible errand of a focused and mature nature that I can perform for you? Balance a checkbook, pay the bills, perhaps file some taxes?"
2,49,Linda,Why do I feel that all of this has something to do with busting your brothers?
2,49,Candace,"What?! (hears mechanical bull) Eh-heh, no. That would be childish of me."
2,49,Stacy,You see? Candace level-headed and responsible. She's not a bit worried about what Phineas and Ferb are doing right now.
2,49,Candace,"(hears mechanical bull) What?! Yes! No, yes, I mean, i-if a responsible focused person..."
2,49,Stacy,Like Candace...
2,49,Candace,"Were to see her brothers engaged in some potential reckless activity,... (gets elbowed) Ow! THAT was childish."
2,49,Man 1,There's no case to ruin it whatsoever!
2,49,Man 2,This is hideous.
2,49,Baljeet,It is getting pretty foggy. Should we call the rodeo off?
2,49,Phineas,"Nah, we'll just incorporate it and have a foggy robot rodeo! YEE-HAW! Ride 'em, cowboy!"
2,49,Baljeet,Ride 'em where?
2,49,Buford,You should see what I'm doin'!
2,49,Isabella,This fog is making my hair frizzy!
2,49,Stacy,"It's so nice to sit and be responsible for a change. Just...focused, you know? And Candace and I were thinking that, oh, a live musical event might be a good opportunity for us to really..."
2,49,Candace,Ma...ma...m-m-m-m-m...
2,49,Stacy,Candace? Tiny Cowboy.
2,49,Candace,Ma... ma...
2,49,Stacy,"(whispering) Candace, the concert!"
2,49,Candace,"I can't help myself! MOM! PHINEAS AND FERB BUILT A RODEO IN THE BACKYARD WITH MECHANICAL BULLS AND BLEACHERS AND IS REALLY DANGEROUS! COME ON, YOU GOTTA BUST THEM! (drags Linda with her)"
2,49,Dr. Hirano,This even I have to see.
2,49,Candace,(opening door) Come on... hey! What happened to Danville?
2,49,Linda,That's quite a fog bank.
2,49,Candace,"(blows) Follow me, come on, come on. This way, ladies. Pick up the pace!"
2,49,Linda,"Candace, slow down!"
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Focus, must finish Inator. (hears applause) Wha... what's all that noise out there? I don't get it, what... what's there to applaud? My fog machine should've obscured everyone's Inators. What could it be..."
2,49,Rodney,"I give you, the Fog Clearer-Inator!"
2,49,Judge,"Once again, Rodney gives us just what we need, just when we need it. That puts him in the lead."
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,WHAT!? An electric fan? I knew I could beat that if I just had a little more time! (sighs) Wait! (Stares at the Agent Containment Unit)
2,49,Linda,"Candace, we've been walking forever! Where's the backyard?"
2,49,Candace,"Hmm... (sniffs, licks, sniffs again) That way! I can smell Phineas and Ferb!"
2,49,Dr. Hirano,And what exactly do they smell like?
2,49,Candace,Motor oil and competence!
2,49,Buford,Hey! Oh! Heyhey!
2,49,Phineas,"What's wrong, Buford?"
2,49,Buford,"I don't know, something's making my bull go whacko!"
2,49,Scientist 1,The animal agents are free!
2,49,Scientist 2,My Inator! How disquieting!
2,49,Scientist 3,"No, Agent C!"
2,49,Scientist 3,"Oh, my Mom's gonna kill me-e-e!"
2,49,Rodney,"No, it's just an electric fan! It's been official to mankind!"
2,49,Rodney,Heh heh heh.
2,49,Buford,That balloon! It's making the bulls angry!
2,49,Phineas,"Hey, kid, you think you can let go of that balloon?"
2,49,Kid,This balloon cost me fifty cents!
2,49,Audience,LET GO OF THE BALLOON!
2,49,Candace,Mom! Mom! The fog is lifting! (enters backyard) Aha! (fog lifts fully) Uh...rodeo? Bu--bu-bu-bu-but the... there was an... and I saw... a-and the bulls...
2,49,Phineas,"Hey, Candace."
2,49,Stacy,"Well, so much for Tiny Cowboy."
2,49,Dr. Hirano,"Ohhhh, you can go to the concert. Candace's single-minded determination to bust her brothers shows focus. Something she hopes rubs off on you, young lady."
2,49,Rodney,"Doofenshmirtz, I see you finally managed to cobble something together. What do you call it? A...Later-inator? (sarcastic laugh)"
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"Noooo, I give you...the Eradicate Rodney's-Inator-inator!"
2,49,Rodney,What?! No fair! (sobs)
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"LIKE A BABY! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT! That's what I was looking for. AND... IT'S THE LAST INATOR STANDING!"
2,49,Judge,Doofenshmirtz wins by default!
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"By default, my favorite way to win!"
2,49,Judge,"Unfortunately, the trophy belt was destroyed in the fight. So...uh, oh! (grabs the balloon that just floated by) Here, take this balloon instead."
2,49,Doofenshmirtz,"(takes the balloon) Eh, a prize is a prize. (at the balloon) I'm going to call you...Balloony II. (hears mooing) What's that?"
2,49,Phineas,"Oh, there you are, Perry."
2,49,Isabella,"Well, this was fun, but I'm gonna go wash my hair, now."
2,49,(Song,Izzy's Got the Frizzies)
2,49,Isabella,It's because of the humidity!
2,49,(Song,Izzy's Got the Frizzies)
2,12,Narrator,"The Chronicles of Meap. Starring Lorenzo Lamas as Meap. Episode 38, ""More Than Meaps the Eye""."
2,12,Phineas,"It's the bottom of the ninth inning, bases are loaded. It all comes down to this final pitch from Ferb the curve Fletcher. And the wind up."
2,12,Phineas,And it's a striiiyiiiiyiiike! And the crowd goes wild! (Cheers)
2,12,Phineas,"Yeah, it looked way outside, but then it was right in the zone. There's a lesson, baseball fans: never judge a book by its cover."
2,12,Candace,"Boring, dull, stupid, lame, heavy-handed and derivative."
2,12,Linda,"Oh, thank you for those insightful reviews of books you haven't read."
2,12,Candace,"Mom, that's why books have covers; to judge them. I mean, why did you choose these books from the library?"
2,12,Linda,They looked interesting.
2,12,Candace,So...
2,12,Linda,"Point taken. Okay honey, I'm off to help Dad at the antique store. Oh, hey, here's a package for you."
2,12,Candace,My Bango-Ru!
2,12,Linda,Your what?
2,12,Candace,My Bango-Ru. They're these adorable Japanese characters that are so in right now. Like in a kitschy way. The lead guitarist for The Bettys has one painted on her guitar. Stacy and I designed our own dolls online.
2,12,Linda,"Well, assuming none of that is teenage code for something I should be worried about as a parent, I'm off."
2,12,Candace,Bye Mom. I got to call Stacy!
2,12,Stacy,Bango-Ru!!!!
2,12,Candace,Bango-Ru!!!
2,12,Stacy,I just got my little bunny-bear! It's a cross between a bunny and a bear! You get it? It's the most precious thing.
2,12,Candace,"I just got mine too. He's a cross between a cow and a frog. I'm calling him ""Señor Frowwg"". He's gonna be the cutest thing, you're just going to..."
2,12,Stacy,Candace? What's going on?
2,12,Candace,I just discovered why cows and frogs don't date.
2,12,Stacy,"Well, We'll still have fun at the Bango-Ru Convention today."
2,12,Candace,"(Sighs) Yeah, I guess."
2,12,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, let's see what this bad boy can do. Go long! Pop fly!. (Phineas launches the ball into the sky) Cool! (The baseball hits a spacecraft, which starts falling toward Earth) Oh, here it comes! (Phineas sees the spacecraft) Hey, Ferb I know what we're going to do today. Run for our lives! (The spaceship crashes in their backyard) Whoa, I think we may have just stopped and/or started an alien invasion. I hope he's not too angry, or hungry."
2,12,Alien,Meap!
2,12,Phineas,"Wow, that is cute. Hey, are you okay? We're really sorry about your ship."
2,12,Alien,Meap!
2,12,Phineas,What's your name?
2,12,Alien,Meap!
2,12,Phineas,Hi Meap! I'm Phineas and this is Ferb.
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Phineas,"Whatcha got there? Hey, this must be his father. Don't worry, Meap. We'll fix your ship, and you'll be with your dad in no time."
2,12,Candace,"Hey Ferb, I know what we're going to do today, Let's get ourselves totally busted by crashing our stupid toy in the backyard."
2,12,Phineas,"Oh, hi Candace. It isn't a toy. It's a real live alien spaceship!"
2,12,Candace,"Oh good! Because this isn't a cell phone. It's an inter-galactic little brother buster-izer. Which I'll use on you if you don't clean up this mess. What's with the spaceship anyway? Haven't you guys, you know, been there, done that?"
2,12,Phineas,"We weren't planning on going into space. But if we did, I'm sure there's still a ton of cool stuff left to do."
2,12,Candace,"Yeah, well I'm all done with outer space. Never again! I'm going to stick with Earth, where I'm the one in charge of busting people who do things they're not supposed to do."
2,12,Candace,"Huh? Oh, that is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my entire life! You guys made a Bango-Ru doll?"
2,12,Phineas,That's Meap.
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Candace,He talks?
2,12,Phineas,"Well, more than Ferb, but ""Meap"" is pretty much the only thing he says."
2,12,Candace,"Well you and your little Bango-robot better not show up at the convention and make me look bad. (She turns around and steps on a baseball launcher, launching a ball into somebody's window) ...That's strike one."
2,12,Phineas,"Okay Ferb, let's fix us an alien spaceship."
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Phineas,"Where do you want to start? Hey Ferb, have you seen Perry?"
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Major Monogram,"Good morning Agent P! I wonder what exciting mission we have for you today. (starts itching his nose) Excuse me, my nose is really itchy. Doofenshmirtz has purchased a lot of carpet, he must be up to something bad. Because he's a bad, bad person... He's this bad. (Holds up his arms to show how bad Doofenshmirtz is. He starts to laugh) I can't do this. Carl was doing my arms. See? (Turns around to show Agent P) Oh, too funny, anyway, stop Doofenshmirtz with the carpet thing."
2,12,Phineas,"It seems to run on a quantum front loading system. Can the wew system support that? (Ferb gives Phineas a ""thumbs up"") Hang on I'll bring you down."
2,12,Isabella,Hi guys! What'cha doin?
2,12,Phineas,"Oh, hi Isabella. come over here and we'll show you. (Phineas realizes Ferb is still attached to the contraption) Oh, oops, sorry Ferb. We're fixing up this spaceship that belongs to our new friend Meap. Meap, he's the most adorable thing in the world."
2,12,Isabella,"Really? Are you sure there's nothing, or no one that's more adorable?"
2,12,Phineas,"No, not a chance. (Isabella frowns dejectedly) Here, see for yourself... Meap? Meap?"
2,12,Stacy,Bango-ru!!!
2,12,Candace,(Dejectedly) Bango-ru.
2,12,Stacy,"(Notices Meap, and mistakes it for Candace's Bango-ru) Oh, Candace! Look at it! It's so cute, I could die!"
2,12,Candace,What? Oh no...
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Stacy,And it makes little noises. How did you do that?
2,12,Candace,"Oh well, Phineas and Ferb, you know?"
2,12,Stacy,"Oh, they tricked it out for you, cool. Come on, lets go to the convention. (She rides off)"
2,12,Candace,"Right behind you. Hmm. Your reign of terror has come to an end Señor Frowwg. (Tosses him into a trash can and then rides off. Meap sees Señor Frowwg and shoots a rainbow death ray from his mouth, defacing Señor Frowwg)"
2,12,Phineas,"Okay. I jury-rigged Ferb's old GPS device, to create a cute tracker. It locks on to the cutest thing in the area, so it should lead us right to Meap. Let's see if we can get a signal. (The cute tracker beeps) Got something!"
2,12,Isabella,"Oh, that's probably me. Sorry."
2,12,Phineas,"No, it's three miles in that direction. Ferb, why don't you stay here and finish the ship? (Ferb salutes Phineas, and knocks himself in the head with a wrench) Isabella, want to come with me and help me find Meap?"
2,12,Isabella,"(Sarcastically) Sure, I still haven't gotten my ""You wouldn't know cute if it bit your legs off"" accomplishment patch."
2,12,Phineas,Cool! Let's go.
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, just in time for your little lesson in static electricity! (A mechanical hand rubs Perry against the carpet, causing him to poof out, then flicks Perry onto a wall, trapping him) Looks like I rubbed you the wrong way, Puffy the Fuzzypus. You might ask; Why the carpet? What is he doing? What is going on? Why is he listing questions I might ask him? Well, I believe the answers are best expressed in back story form."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"When I was a boy, the smell of pork emanating from me was so bad because of well, (Back in Doofenshmirtz's lair) well the reason's unimportant, it was part of a different emotionally scaring back story. I'm not getting into... regardless the smell of pork was so bad (Flashback) that no one would come near me. So one day the carnival came to town and I needed money because of, (Back in his lair) well another back story that, basically my parents disowned me, I was being raised by ocelots. (Flashback #2) The point is, I had to get a job at the carnival, but the only work was at the dunking booth, and not as the guy who got dunked, I was what they threw to dunk him, which is again a whole other back story. Okay, long back story short, I got a balloon at the carnival, I drew a face on him, I sprayed him with special ""Life-Long-Lasting"" spray I created, and I named him Balloony. He became my best friend in the whole world, yadda yadda yadda. Then one tragic day, when I was protecting our garden as a lawn gnome, whatever you remember that back story. Balloony started floating away. I tried to reach out and grab him, but..."
2,12,Mr. Doofenshmirtz,(from inside) Bewege dich nicht! (Don't move!)
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"And I never saw Balloony again. (Flashback ends) He's still out there, somewhere. Not to put to fine a point on it, but I put that Long Lasting spray on him. So he's still out around. And I plan to bring him to me! Balloons, you see, are attracted to static electricity, so I created this. Behold the Static Electro-Amplif-Inator! Keep beholding, keep beholding, beholding, and we're still beholding, and scene."

2,12,Phineas,I keep getting some kind of cute interference...
2,12,Isabella,"It's me! I'm endangering the mission, I shouldn't've come!"
2,12,Phineas,No. Now it's cleared up. I wonder how Ferb is doing.

2,12,Baljeet,Agreed.
2,12,Ferb,You're digging my ride from outer space.
2,12,Stacy,This is so weird.
2,12,Candace,It's like a strange alien world.
2,12,Stacy,Ooh! Bango-Ru purses!
2,12,Candace,No way! Let me see! Let me see!
2,12,Stacy,Look how cute!
2,12,Candace,I think I saw this on the on the red carpet the other night.
2,12,Guard 1,What? Hey!
2,12,Guard 2,I got it. (Picks up Meap) Irresponsible kids.
2,12,Candace,I'm totally going to have to get some Bango-shoes to go with this!
2,12,Guard 2,"Hey, is this your doll, young lady?"
2,12,Candace,Yeah.
2,12,Guard 2,We found it abandoned on the floor over there.
2,12,Candace,"Oh, sorry."
2,12,Guard 2,Your irresponsibility makes our job as security guards a million times harder! Someone could have stolen it. Or tripped over it.
2,12,Guard 1,"That's right. Injuries, lawsuits, stolen property."
2,12,Guard 2,Even death!
2,12,Guard 1,"Yes, you could have killed me."
2,12,Guard 2,Me too!
2,12,Guard 1,We're lucky to be alive.
2,12,Guard 2,"Yeah, you're in big trouble."
2,12,Phineas,The cute signal's getting stronger.
2,12,Isabella,Phineas...?
2,12,Phineas,Yes?
2,12,Isabella,How come you think Meap is so cute. What does that even mean anyway? Cute.
2,12,Phineas,"I can't define cute. I just know it when I pick it up on my cuteness meter. Although, I keep getting this weird cute interference from somewhere."
2,12,Phineas,"Whoa! Sweet you tricked it out! Isabella and I are hot on Meap's trail, let's bounce."
2,12,Candace,(Riding her bike) You can't ban me from Bango-Ru conventions for life. I ban myself! (Looks at Meap) What kind of a toy are you anyway?
2,12,Phineas,"(In a thought bubble) It isn't a toy, it's a real live alien spaceship."
2,12,Candace,That's it! You're not a toy! You're a real live alien.
2,12,Phineas,"Hey Candace, you found Meap."
2,12,Candace,More like he found me.
2,12,Phineas,"Well, his ship's fixed, so he can get back to his family now."
2,12,Isabella,What's happening?
2,12,Phineas,We're caught in some kind of tractor beam! It's pulling us in! Maybe it's the space authorities. Did we do something wrong?
2,12,Ferb,"Well, it occurs to me that not all of the modifications I made are technically ""Street Legal""."
2,12,Candace,What's going on? Wait! Come back! (At Meap) Who was that? (Meap pulls out the photo of an alien) That was your father? But why...
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Candace,"Oh, it's not your father? It's a mug shot? Oh no! Phineas and Ferb have been abducted by an intergalactic criminal!"
2,12,Meap,(Sadly) Meap.
2,12,Isabella,Where's he taking us?
2,12,Phineas,Look! He's headed for that small cloud!
2,12,Ferb,"That's no cloud, that's a space station."
2,12,Phineas,I got a good feeling about this!
2,12,Alien,"Ha, you thought you were clever disguising your ship, but I've got you now ...whoever you are."
2,12,Phineas,"Hey look, it's Meap's dad."
2,12,Alien,"Alright, what the heck is going on here? Is this some kind of joke?"
2,12,Phineas,"I'm Phineas, that's Isabella, and this is Ferb."
2,12,Isabella,What's your name?
2,12,Alien,"I am know by many names throughout the universe, well two mainly. Mitch, and some of the guys call me Big Mitch. Anyway, where did you get this ship?"
2,12,Phineas,It's Meap's ship.
2,12,Mitch,Meap?
2,12,Phineas,Yep.
2,12,Mitch,"About ""yay"" high, big eyes..."
2,12,Phineas,The biggest!
2,12,Mitch,Kinda looks like this?
2,12,Isabella,That's Meap?
2,12,Phineas,That's Meap!
2,12,Mitch,That's my mortal enemy.
2,12,Phineas,Really? He seems like such a nice guy.
2,12,Mitch,"He is; I'm not. You see, I steal rare creatures from their home worlds, and imprison them on my ship. I'm a..."
2,12,Phineas,You're a zookeeper?
2,12,Mitch,"No, that sorta legitimizes it. Umm..."
2,12,Isabella,You're a poacher!
2,12,Mitch,Yes! I'm a poacher.
2,12,Isabella,That's wrong! These poor creatures shouldn't be lock up here.
2,12,Phineas,"Yeah, they should be brought back to their homes and set free."
2,12,Mitch,"Oh, really? Maybe I should lock you three up in here as well."
2,12,Phineas,"Nah, that's cool. Tonight's taco night at home."
2,12,Candace,"Hi Mom. Phineas and Ferb have been abducted by an evil alien, and I'm here with another alien, who isn't his son, and... How does that sound so far? (Meap blinks) I agree. Craaazey! What are we going to do? (Meap walks off, and returns with one of Phineas and Ferb's baseball launchers) Play catch? Well, if you think it will help. (Meap begins to pull out pictures, in an attempt to explain his plan to Candace. First with Phineas and Ferb) Phineas and Ferb. (Meap pulls out a picture of Mitch) Your father. (Meap pulls out another picture of him)  No, right not your father. A bad guy. Say where do you keep all these pictures?"
2,12,Meap,Meap! (Signals for Candace to focus)
2,12,Candace,"Right, stay focus. (Meap next pulls out a picture of the space station) Their in a giant spaceship. But how are we supposed to get up there and save them? (Meap grabs the baseball launcher, and shoots a baseball into the sky) Oh! I get it. Duh. You're trying to tell me something. (Pause) What?"
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"So you know when you walk around in socks and rub them across the carpet, you get that little static shock? (He comes out from behind the screen) Behold, the new uniform of pure evil! I call it the socky-shocky-suity."
2,12,Phineas,"Oh, cool!"
2,12,Mitch,"Would you three sit still? You don't get it. You're my prisoners. You should be afraid of me! (Turns his attention to his monitor, showing Meap coming toward him) Ah, like a moth to the flame."
2,12,Candace,Whoa. I got this situation totally under control.
2,12,Mitch,"(Still looking at his screen) You kids might be of some use to me after- Hey, hey, don't go in there. (Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella leaves through a door) You'll track dirt back into the corridor. Ugh, I'll deal with them later."
2,12,Candace,"Wow, check this place out. Well, now I know how to find Phineas and Ferb. They'll be where the cool stuff is."
2,12,Phineas/Ferb/Isabella,WooHoo!
2,12,Candace,"Ca-Ching! Okay, I'll go in and get them, you stay here. This could get dangerous."
2,12,Candace,"Wow, cool!"
2,12,Mitch,"So, we meet again."
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Mitch,"I agree, it ends here. Oh, and by the way I talked to your little friends, and just so we're clear, I am not your father."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, I'm almost done charging up to socky-shocky-suity suit. You know it's the technical side of evil I think people don't really appreciate. There! Now watch as every balloon in the entire Tri-State area is ripped from the hands of children, clowns, and ... clown-children. Hahahaha. (He connects himself with the Static Electro-Amplif-Inator ripping balloon from children, clowns, and clown-children, filling up DEI) Wow, that's a lot of balloons."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"You know on paper, this was the outcome too."
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Mitch,Oh yeah?
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh man, what the... (Seeing Mitch) Oh, Hello."
2,12,Mitch,"We're right in the middle of a showdown, if you don't mind."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Uh, I get it. It looks serious. Nemesis confrontation. One of those ""it ends here"" kind of things. Whoo-ee Not fun. Okay, well don't mind me, I'm just playing through as they say."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"You're doing fine, just ignore me. I'll show myself out. (Opens a door)"
2,12,Mitch,No! That's where I keep--
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,It's you. Balloony.
2,12,Mitch,Hey! That's the most unique creature in my collection. Collin. My best friend.
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"What! That's Balloony, my best friend"
2,12,Mitch,"No, I found Collin just floating all alone in space."
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I actually drew his face! Look, look, I signed it."
2,12,Mitch,That's a birthmark.
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"A birthmark! It's a balloon you idiot! ""Collin"". Come on Balloony, let's scoot."
2,12,Doofensmirtz,Ba-Balloony?
2,12,Mitch,Ha. See? Collin is my best friend.
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"You've changed, Balloony. And I though you were actually back-story worthy. It makes me sick! Well, I don't even need you anymore. Yeah, I've got an even better best friend. He's a really good listener, he even put up with me going on about how great you were! Ha! (Perry finally climbs into the spaceship) It's clear to me now that my real best friend is Perry the Platy—Oof! (Perry knocks him out of the large hole in the bottom of the ship)"
2,12,Doofenshmirtz,"Uh, hello? Falling to my doom here! (Perry jumps out to go help him)"
2,12,Mitch,All too easy.
2,12,Isabella,That was awesome.
2,12,Phineas,I knew there was still more cool stuff to do in space.
2,12,Phineas,Uh oh.
2,12,Isabella,What are they?
2,12,Phineas,I don't know. (At a robot) Hi. (Robot shoots laser at Phineas) Okay?
2,12,Candace,(Holding the baseball launcher) Strike three. They're out.
2,12,Phineas,Cool! What ever happened to strike two?
2,12,Candace,Uh... Where's Meap? I told him to wait right here.
2,12,Phineas,"Hmm, I'm having trouble picking up his cute signal."
2,12,Isabella,"Phineas, since you obviously won't figure this out on your own, I think I'm the one causing the cute interference."
2,12,Phineas,"Don't be silly Isabella. I took into account your cuteness, and adjusted the cute-meter settings accordingly from the beginning. See, look what happens when I change it back to normal. (The cute-meter overloads due to an excessively strong cute signal from Isabella) Oops, so much for finding Meap."
2,12,Isabella,Do you think he's okay?
2,12,Mitch,"No, no I don't."
2,12,Phineas,Hi Mitch.
2,12,Meap,Meap!
2,12,Candace,"(Points the Baseball Launcher at Mitch)  Get away from him, Mitch!"
2,12,Mitch,"Foolish children, only now do you understand your grave situation."
2,12,Mitch,"(Makes voice high and squeaky) ""Hi, Mitch!"" ""Look at the cool stuff, Mitch!"" ""Blah, blah, blah, MITCH!"""
2,12,Phineas,"Ha. He totally nailed you, Ferb."
2,12,Mitch,"Silence. I mean seriously, seriously. You're still not getting this. You're all trapped, on my ship forever! Like animals in a cage. Get it? You lost, I won!"
2,12,Candace,"(After opening Meap's cage with the baseball) Go, hide."
2,12,Candace,Huh?
2,12,Isabella,Whoa.
2,12,Candace,I... I don't believe it.
2,12,Mitch,"Okay, okay I surrender, you can stop behaving in a way counter intuitive to how you superficially appear. We get it. Hey! Stay away from my universal mustache translator. Ow! MEAP!"
2,12,Meap,"Meap! (He puts on the mustache translator) Children, thank you for your help in bringing down this villainous scoundrel. You see, I am an intergalactic security agent who roams the universe, busting people who do stuff they're not supposed to do."
2,12,Candace,You're like the me of the galaxy.
2,12,Meap,"Exactly. I am pleased to not only have made some true friends, but to have met a kindred spirit as well."
2,12,Candace,"I thought Meap was a helpless little creature. Huh, I guess I learned to never judge a book by its cover again."
2,12,Candace,(Screams) An alien monster! Get to the ship!
2,12,Meap,"Actually that's my mother-in-law, so yeah she's correct. Let's get out of here! (Phineas, Ferb, and Isabella follow)"
2,12,Mitch,Hahahahaha!
2,12,Mitch,Aren't you a little young to save the universe?
2,12,Phineas,"Yes. Yes, I am."

2,9,Phineas,"Ferb, what's that noise? (Gurgling continues) Is that your stomach?"
2,9,Phineas,"Yeah, I'm hungry, too. That trendy restaurant Mom and Dad took us to last night wasn't exactly satisfying."
2,9,Phineas,"Dad, can I borrow your glasses? I can't see my entrée. You know, because it's so small."
2,9,Lawrence,"Yes, I think we got that."
2,9,Phineas,"How hard is it to have a trendy restaurant that's fun to go to, and has great food? That's it. I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb."
2,9,Candace,"(Phone rings) S'up, Stace?"
2,9,Stacy,"Candace, are you sitting down? I don't want you to have an aneurism."
2,9,Candace,Why would I have an aneurism?
2,9,Stacy,"'Cause someone just IM'd me that someone else heard someone else overhear that Jeremy is gonna call you and ask you out for a special evening tonight! (Both squeal) Candace, do you need medical attention?"
2,9,Candace,Oh. I need attention... from the doctor of love!
2,9,Stacy,Paging Dr. Jeremy.
2,9,Candace,"Doctor, I got a fever."
2,9,Stacy,"(Deep voice) Well, let me take care of that, little lady."
2,9,Candace,"Wow, a special evening. (Phone beeps) It's my call waiting."
2,9,Linda,"Honey, just calling to remind you..."
2,9,Candace,"Uh, it wasn't him."
2,9,Stacy,"Don't worry, he'll call."
2,9,Isabella,"Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'?"
2,9,Phineas,"Ferb and I decided to build a restaurant. Hey, you could be our hostess!"
2,9,Isabella,Hmm. What'cha eatin'?
2,9,Phineas,You guys can bus tables. Baljeet can be our soda jerk.
2,9,Baljeet,I make a mean milkshake!
2,9,Phineas,Ferb will be our chef.
2,9,Buford,"Hey, I can work the velvet rope. (holds it out) I never leave home without my velvet rope."
2,9,Phineas,Uh... where do you keep that?
2,9,Buford,I'll never tell.
2,9,Isabella,"So, what's the name of your restaurant?"
2,9,Phineas,"Chez Platypus, of course! By the way, where's Perry?"
2,9,Major Monogram,"What? Nothing available for tonight? Oh, never mind. (To Perry) Er, sorry, Agent P. It's date night tonight with the wife, and if I don't figure out something special to do, I'm royally in the doghouse."
2,9,Carl,Rreow! Pkshh!
2,9,Major Monogram,"Carl! Anyway, Agent P, sources indicate Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to one of his evil schemes. I need you to get out there and put a stop to it. Good luck."

2,9,Jeremy,"Okay, so, I was wondering if you wanted to do something tonight? Just the two of us?"

2,9,Candace,Bye.

2,9,Candace/Jeremy,(In unison) Yes!
2,9,Candace,"(Power tools buzzing) Oh, no. (Candace sticks her head out the window) Listen, you twerps. Sometimes your stuff messes with my stuff, and tonight I got some big stuff going on. So you leave your stuff out there, and leave my stuff alone, or you'll get some of this stuff! Get it?!"
2,9,Phineas,"So, are we pairing the chicken entrée with the soup?"
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, Perry the Platypus! You must have noticed how I reinforced the locks, but, you know, not the door. Well, let's just get you out of... You're... You're really trapped in here, just... Just like I planned, obviously. So let me tell you my latest scheme. I'm so tired of all these happy couples around me, romantic and laughing, mocking me with their happiness. Well, not anymore. My De Love-inator satellite will eliminate the feeling of love in the entire Tri-State Area. All I have to do is press this button. It would be so easy to press it right now. It would be so simple, but, you know, I've got a date tonight, and I like to stay optimistic. But if we don't hit it off, I'm definitely gonna ruin it for everyone else."
2,9,Candace,Hi.
2,9,Jeremy,Hi. Ready?
2,9,Candace,"I'm, like, so looking forward to tonight. A special evening, just the two of us. So, what do you have planned? Horseback riding? I just love horseback riding. Oh, you stopped."
2,9,Jeremy,"Ta-da! Your brothers have opened the trendiest restaurant in town, and this is where I'm taking you."
2,9,Candace,"Oh. Uh, really? Heh. How... fun."
2,9,Jeremy,"Well, i-if you prefer to do something else..."
2,9,Candace,Well...
2,9,Woman,"Platypus-themed restaurants are so now, so wow. It will be a miracle if we get in."
2,9,Man,Cool.
2,9,Candace,"Let's definitely eat here. But no way are we waiting in this line. I practically own the place. (To other people in line) Come on! Outta my way, people! VIP coming through! (To Buford) All right, Buford, make with the rope and let us in."
2,9,Buford,Name?
2,9,Candace,It's me.
2,9,Buford,"""Me"" who?"
2,9,Candace,I'm Candace. Candace Flynn?
2,9,Buford,You're not on the list. You should have made a reservation yesterday.
2,9,Candace,This restaurant didn't exist yesterday. I demand to be let in right now.
2,9,Buford,"Good evening, sir."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I forgot to make a reservation."
2,9,Buford,"No problem, dude."
2,9,Candace,Did that guy just bribe you?
2,9,Buford,"He didn't bribe me. He just caught my attention in a monetary fashion. Now, back in line."
2,9,Isabella,"Right this way to your table, sir."
2,9,Phineas,"Hey, Isabella. Have you seen Perry?"
2,9,Isabella,"No, not lately."
2,9,Phineas,Hmm.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,So I noticed in your online profile that you say you like tall men. Is--? Is--? Is that true?
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,That's right. And you're not very tall at all.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, I-I'm 6'2"". I slouch."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,"My last date was 6'9"". Now, that's a good-looking man. But I'll be honest, I've never been able to resist a man in a lab coat."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"(Gasps) Really? Look. Look, I'm wearing one right now."
2,9,Phineas,"Hey. There you are, Perry. We've gotta put you in your place of honor."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,I'm usually extremely attracted to blonds.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,I-I see.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,But there is something about your windblown style that gives me goose bumps.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Really? Well, I-I must say, it's quite a bit of work in the morning, you know, but apparently worth it."
2,9,Phineas,"There you go, Perry. Now everyone can see you."
2,9,(Song,"""Quirky Worky Song"")"
2,9,Phineas,"Hey, Ferb. We need a chicken special for table five."
2,9,Buford,Enjoy your meal.
2,9,Candace,Really. You're letting complete strangers in. I'm the owners' sister. I demand to be let in right now! I'm supposed to be having the time of my life!
2,9,Jeremy,Candace? I really don't mind waiting a bit. It's actually kinda fun just hanging out here with you.
2,9,Candace,"Oh, really?"
2,9,Buford,"All right, next party, step this way."
2,9,Candace,"Oh, come on!"
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"So, how do you feel about evil?"
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,Huh? That's a weird question.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,Is it? I-I'm just making conversation.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,But I love it. Look.
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"You have an evil tattoo. Look, look, look, just like mine."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz's date,"I can't believe we have so much in common. Y-you know, I don't even put ""evil"" on my profile anymore because it attracts so many weirdos."
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,Don't I know it.
2,9,Candace,"That's it. I'm calling Mom and making her tell the boys to let us in. (To Linda) Mom, Phineas and Ferb made an exclusive restaurant in the yard and you've got to tell them to tell Buford to let us in."
2,9,Linda,"Okay, okay, honey. We're just finishing dinner. We'll be home in a minute."
2,9,Candace,"Argh! (At Jeremy) Jeremy, hold our place in line. I'm going out front to wait for my Mom."
2,9,Jeremy,But Candace...
2,9,Doofenshmirtz,"Perry the Platypus? Oh, looking for my remote, are you? Well, here. Take it. I don't need it anymore. I am in love!"

2,9,Candace,"Mom, Dad, the boys have a restaurant in the yard, and they're not letting me in. You've gotta put a stop to it! Come on!"
2,9,Jeremy,Goodbye!
2,9,Phineas,Have fun with the restaurant!
2,9,Candace,"Uh, guys? Ugh, whatever."
2,9,Jeremy,"Excuse me, miss. Do you have a table for two?"
2,9,Isabella,"(Giggles) Right this way, sir."
2,9,Baljeet,Enjoy.
2,9,Jeremy,"You know, Candace, I've had a lot of fun in your backyard, but this is the best time yet."
2,9,Linda,"Oh, look. How adorable! (To Candace) Candace, you want me to put a stop to this?"
2,9,Candace,"No! No, no, no! Go! Shoo! Keep moving, nothing to see here. (To Jeremy) Now, where were we?"

2,8,Stacy,"""Boys are human beings too. (Camera rotates, showing Stacy holding the magazine) If you're interested in one of them, make them feel comfortable by asking him questions about himself."" Okay, they lost me at the ""boys/human beings"" thing."
2,8,Stacy,"Candace, this article specifically says not to growl psychotically. It makes boys feel uncomfortable."
2,8,Candace,"Look at them down there. Planning something. Oh, I'm gonna bust them today for sure."
2,8,Stacy,That's what you say everyday.
2,8,Candace,"Well, that's because they build something everyday. Seems like every time I get Mom and I'm ready to bust, their stupid invention disappears."
2,8,Stacy,"Candace, looks to me like you're going about this the wrong way. Don't focus on the boys; focus on the invention. If you can find out where the stuff goes, maybe you can take your Mom there and she'd finally see the evidence."
2,8,Candace,"Yeah! Stacy, you're a genius!"
2,8,Stacy,"Wow, go figure! Would you call my mom and tell her that?"
2,8,Candace,"Hey, Phineas!"
2,8,Phineas,Yo.
2,8,Candace,"Uh, you know how you guys, like, build stuff everyday?"
2,8,Phineas,Yeah?
2,8,Candace,And you know how you make it disappear at the end of the day?
2,8,Phineas,No.
2,8,Candace,"And-- What do you mean ""No""?"
2,8,Phineas,We don't make it disappear.
2,8,Candace,"(Scoffs) Well, then where does it go?"
2,8,Phineas,"We don't know what happens to it, but it helps with cleanup. And Ferb here says to never look a gift horse in a mouth."
2,8,Candace,So you're telling me you're not even a slightest bit curious as to where the thing goes?
2,8,Phineas,"Yeah, I guess we're a little bit curious. Hmm... Why don't Ferb and I build something and you guys keep your eyes on it? Maybe you can find out where the thing goes."
2,8,Candace,"Sounds like a plan! (At Stacy) A plan of busting! (They high-5, at Phineas) All right boys, make it big and make it obvious."
2,8,Candace,"Now remember, we can't take our eyes off of this for even a second."
2,8,Stacy,What if I need to blink?
2,8,Candace,Here! (Pulls out an aerosol can) Use this! Saline solution.
2,8,Phineas,"Hey, (Opens Ferb's welding mask) where's Perry?"
2,8,Major Monogram,"What do you think, too much? Oh, I'm just getting into the mood. I'm going to Vegas this weekend. (Pause) Okay. (Takes a sheet) Our sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz is working on an invisibility ray, and that can't be good. Get out there and put a stop to it. (Perry runs off) And may luck be with you! Lady luck, baby! Hot-cha."
2,8,Isabella,Hey Phineas. Whatcha doin'?
2,8,Phineas,We're just building a big and obvious ride in our backyard!
2,8,Isabella,Cool! Can I ride it?
2,8,Candace,Nobody riding anything! We're just gonna watch it.
2,8,Phineas,Candace wants to see where it goes.
2,8,Isabella,Okay...
2,8,Buford,Whoa! What is that?
2,8,Candace,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just another one of their cool rides. Just get behind us and help us watch it."
2,8,Buford,How's my schedule?
2,8,Baljeet,"Well, right now you're just carrying me around like luggage."
2,8,Buford,We're in!
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,Perry the Platypus? You're just in time. (Pulls out a remote) Just in time to be trapped! (Presses the remote button. A crashing sound is heard. Perry looks around for the trap) Didn't Major Monogram tell you I was working on an invisible ray?
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Yeah, well, I made one, and now you're in an invisible cage. And so you don't get bored, I put in an invisible tin cup in there for you to play with."
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Yes, see? Fun with sound. Behold, Perry the Platypus, (Presses the remote button) my Invis-inator! (The Invis-inator fires) And why would I need an Invisibility ray like this, you ask? Well, you know when those cute, little Fireside Girls come by to sell their-- Their cupcakes, or their-- Or their raffle tickets or whatever?"
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"And you forgot to close your shades, (Gretchen and Katie walk up to the door. Gretchen knocks the door) so they come to the front door, and they could see you! (Gretchen and Katie peek through the window) They could see you, watching TV or whatever, (Doofenshmirtz sits back) and you can't pretend that you're not home (Doofenshmirtz sinks in his chair) because they can see you! And they have those big, pleading eyes making you feel guilty, and-- (Scene switches back to Doofenshmirtz) So, I'm just gonna shoot them with a ray so I don't have to look at them."
2,8,Candace,"Hey! No shuteye, girly."
2,8,(Song,Watchin' and Waitin')
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"You see, Perry the Platypus, the entire Tri-State Area-- (Scratching) Hey, what-- What are you doing? Is that an invisible file? You've forced my hand! I have no choice (Presses the button) but to open the trap door, (The door opens) and releases the invisible tiger! (Turns around) Hmm... Uh, are you feeling any biting or scratching in there, because--"
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Is seen with his coat scratched, carrying a whip and chair) Back, you tiger! Ow! Where-- Where are you? So I can snap my whip at you! (Snaps the whip twice) Get in there! Get back, get back! (Drops the whip and presses the button) In there! (The door closes) I attribute that to poor planning. (Throws away the chair) If I had the tiger door inside your cage, you would have been-- (Gets hit by Perry swinging on a rope. Doofenshmirtz rolls into the Invis-inator's ray) Now, Perry the Platypus, you can never be sure where the final strike will come from. (Perry turns around) Ah, I'm an imperceptible enigma. I move in silence-- (Perry kicks him) Ow! Oh you followed the sound of my voice, maybe I should stop talk-- (Perry punches and kicks him) Ow, ow, ow! Quit it! (He knocks down a chair and rolls into the Invis-inator's ray, causing him to become visible again) Interesting! If you're already invisible, it turns you visible again-- (Perry throws the chair at him) Ow! Oh well that came out of nowhere."
2,8,Stacy,"So, how long is this gonna take?"
2,8,Candace,"I mean it usually disappears as soon as the kids are done playing on it-- (Gets an idea) Oop! Wait a minute, that's it! (At the gang) You guys gotta play on it! Go! Go have fun! Go!"
2,8,Phineas,Okay.
2,8,Buford,"(Is seen sitting on Baljeet) Eh, my schedule's flexible."
2,8,Baljeet,I used to be.
2,8,(Song,Quirky Worky Song)
2,8,Buford,(Laughs) WOO-HOO-HOO! OH BUFORD LOVES THIS!
2,8,Candace,"That's it, laugh. Laugh while you still can."
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"(Laughs) Look at you! You're just a bottom! (Perry punches him) Oh, it's on now! (Charges at Perry, who throws him over. Doofenshmirtz's body is now half invisible) Oop! Look at me! I'm just a top!"
2,8,Candace,"Okay, fun's fun! Now everybody, back in your seats! Now if we just keep watching it..."
2,8,Candace,"Any minute now... (Horn honks. Candace gasps) I can't believe it! Mom's home! (The Invis-inator's ray hits the ride) There's no way she's gonna miss the-- (Notices the ride disappeared. She screams) Phineas, what did you do?"
2,8,Phineas,I don't... Th-th-- Think I did anything!
2,8,Candace,"Wait, it's Mom! It only happens when she comes home!"
2,8,Candace,Mom! Mom! Do me a favor and just back down the driveway a bit!
2,8,Linda,"Uh, okay. (She backs away. The Invis-inator's ray is heard)"
2,8,Candace,Any changes?
2,8,Phineas,It's back!
2,8,Candace,"I can't believed that worked! (At Linda) Okay Mom, come back! Come back! (Linda drives back. The Invis-inator's ray hits the ride, causing it to disappear)"
2,8,Phineas,It's gone again!
2,8,Isabella,"Candace, how are you doing that?"
2,8,Candace,Back back back back back! (Shoves the car backwards. She steps around the spot) There's gotta be some kind of sensor in the driveway! (Camera switches to Linda) But where is it? (Camera switches to Candace stepping around the spot) It's gotta be here somewhere! (Ray fires)
2,8,Kids,"It's back! (Candace looks back, leaning) It's gone! (Candace leans forward) It's back! (Candace leans backward) It's gone! (Candace repeatedly leans forward and backward) Back! Gone! Back! Gone!"
2,8,Linda,"(Looks out the window) Candace, you obviously have some issues with the driveway. I'm just gonna park in front. (Backs away to the front of the house. The ray fires, and the ride come back)"
2,8,Kids,It's back!
2,8,Candace,"Wait, she can see it from the front yard! (Runs to the car) Mom!"
2,8,Linda,"Just a sec, honey. I'm getting my stuff."
2,8,Candace,"Mom, look! (The ray fires, and the ride disappears) No!"
2,8,Phineas,"Hey Candace, it's still here! It's just invisible!"
2,8,Candace,What?! (Runs to the backyard) It's still here?
2,8,Stacy,"Candace, check this out!"
2,8,Candace,Hum... (Gasps) Paint!
2,8,Linda,"(With grocery bags) Candace, where are you going?"
2,8,Candace,"I'll be right back! (At the garage she grabs a can of paint, then runs back) Ee-ee-ee-ee..."
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"You think you've beaten me, but you haven't, 'cause I can turn the Invis-inator into a Disintegrator, with just the simple (Pushes a button. The ray prepares to fire) push of a button!"
2,8,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey, I was using that!"
2,8,Linda,Hey kids!
2,8,Phineas,Hi Mom!
2,8,Linda,I got some--
2,8,Candace,"(Running excitedly, with the can of paint) Coming through!"
2,8,Linda,"Candace, what are you doing?"
2,8,Candace,"You'll see! Everyone will see! (Cackles maniacally. She dumps the paint on the spot where the ride was, causing the paint to splat on the grass. Candace drops the paint can) I don't understand! I don't understand! (Tries to feel the ride) I just don't understand!"
2,8,Linda,"Candace, I have no idea what you're up to, but you're more that welcome to join us for cookies when you're done cleaning up. (At the kids) Come on kids!"
2,8,Kids,Yeah!/Cool!/Go Mom!/Buford loves cookies!
2,8,Ferb,"Well, we were all watching it, and Quantum Theory states that the mere observation of an experiment changes its outcome."
2,8,Candace,Now you tell me.
2,13,Linda,"(from inside) All right Candace. (Cuts to the kitchen where she picks up her purse on the counter, where Candace is sitting and dialing her phone.) I'm off to the grocery store. You're in charge."
2,13,Candace,"Whoa-whoa-whoa wai-wai-wait! By ""in charge"", does that mean I'm in control of everything around here while you're gone?"
2,13,Linda,(turning around) Yes.
2,13,Candace,Including Phineas and Ferb? I'm the complete overlord of them?
2,13,Linda,"(suspiciously) Suddenly I'm a little scared. But, technically, yes."
2,13,Candace,"So like, in a court of law, any—"
2,13,Linda,"Candace, I'll be back later. (leaves)"
2,13,Candace,"(deeply) Excellent! (singsong, to something offscreen) Oh, boys?"
2,13,Candace,"Hear ye, hear ye! Mom has left me in charge, so I hereby demand that you do nothing crazy today. No building any whoosy-whatzits, or goozy-mahookoffs! In other words, don't be the world's most annoying brothers for one afternoon, okay?"
2,13,Female Voice,"Your brothers are annoying you, too?"
2,13,Girl (cont'd),"Hi, I'm Mandy. (opens the fence gate and approaches Candace) And me and my world's most annoying brothers are visiting our aunt next door for the weekend."
2,13,Candace,"Oh, you're Mrs. Weaver's niece. You have annoying brothers?"
2,13,Mandy,"Oh, my gosh! My brothers, Thaddeus and Thor, are constantly building the most annoying contraptions on Earth! Soapbox cars with lawn mower engines..."
2,13,Candace,(offscreen) Uh-huh.
2,13,Mandy,...tire swings that launch over the roof...
2,13,Candace,(offscreen) Uh-huh!
2,13,Mandy,...a mini shopping center for the cat!
2,13,Candace,Finally! Someone who relates! Listen to how annoying Phineas and Ferb are. One time...
2,13,Thaddeus,"(snaps) Gum me. (Thor gives his brother a gum ball, which he chews and blows.) 'Sup, chumps? Thaddeus. Thor. Overheard you two like to build stuff. Where we come from, we're known as the best. Jealous?"
2,13,Phineas,"No. No, I'm not."
2,13,Thaddeus,"Well, you should be. Today, we're building the most awesome fort ever. What do you think of that, suckers?! Ha! Hahahahaha!"
2,13,Phineas,Cool. (waves) Good luck. (Ferb gives a thumbs up as Thaddeus and Thor exit the scene. Phineas suddenly gets a cool demeanor on his face as he snaps.) Gum me.
2,13,Ferb,Puh-lease.
2,13,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,13,Major Monogram,Agent P? Agent P?
2,13,Major Monogram,"Agent P? Where is he, Carl?"
2,13,Carl,"(offscreen) I don't know, sir. Maybe he decided to quit."
2,13,Major Monogram,"Quit? Well, why would he wanna do that?"
2,13,Carl,"(offscreen) Well, remember his last mission? You were pretty tough on him, sir."
2,13,Major Monogram,"Hmm. You're right, Carl. I can be pretty rough sometimes. (sadly) Poor Agent P. Do you think the little guy will ever forgive me? (Perry finally drops into his chair to see Monogram crying, but he then looks up happily) Oh, uh, Agent P, you're here! Ahem! (seriously) So, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been sighted in the Danville Park. We need you to make sure no one is in any danger. (Perry salutes and leaves) There he goes. (guiltily) Jeez, Carl, just hope I wasn't too rough on him this time."
2,13,Carl,"(offscreen) I don't know, sir. He looked pretty upset to me."
2,13,Major Monogram,(putting his head in his hand) I hate myself.
2,13,Mandy,"I dunno, Candace. In terms of obnoxiousness, I'm sure my brothers have your brothers beat."
2,13,Candace,"Ha! I beg to differ. Yes, they're both obnoxious, but my brothers' stuff has a sprinkling of awesomeness...which makes it that much more annoying!"
2,13,Mandy,"Um, have you not been listening? Today, my brothers are building a fort and it'll probably be the most obnoxiously awesome fort ever built!"
2,13,Candace,Not if my brothers are building one!
2,13,Mandy,Oh yeah?!
2,13,Candace,"Yeah! It's on, sister!"
2,13,Thaddeus,"Well, Thor, I know who we're gonna outdo today!"
2,13,Candace,There you are! I order you to get out there and build a fort!
2,13,Phineas,I thought you wanted us to take the day off and not annoy you.
2,13,Candace,Those kids next door are building a fort and I will be annoyed if theirs is better than yours!
2,13,Phineas,"Candace, we don't do this to compete. We do it for fun."
2,13,Ferb,And for the ladies. Rrrrrow. (raises eyebrows seductively)
2,13,Candace,"Well, do it cuz I say so!"
2,13,"(Cut to Danville Park, where a sack race is going on. Above it the banner reads",)
2,13,Doofenshmirtz,"(disgruntled) Oh, hi, Perry the Platypus. Welcome to the Doofenshmirtz family reunion. They're just about to start the dreaded kickball game that my mother organizes every year. The one my brother's team always wins. You see, I'm not very coordinated with my feet. But with my hands...Hey, watch this. (Doof reaches offscreen and grabs a table with several cups on them. He does a few impressive stacking tricks with the cups.) See? I hold the cup-stacking world record. But does my mother care? No! (pushes the table offscreen) You see, Perry the Platypus, throughout my childhood, my mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball. You know, I think—I think this is best expressed through song. (strums a balalaika)"

W-W-Wait right here, I'll show you! (He exits offscreen. We hear a mechanical noise, and he comes back with an electronic leg.) Behold, the Kickinator 5000! Could you help me practice, please, please? Just take the ball and go over there and then just roll it to me. Go ahead. Any time. I'm ready. (The ball rolls to Doof, but nothing happens.) Well, you—you threw it too early! (Gets the ball back) Couldn't you tell I wasn't ready? (He throws the ball back and Perry catches it) Come on, try again. Okay, do it right this time. (The Kickinator 5000 suddenly kicks Doof's chin and he lands on his bottom. The ball rolls off.) It's, uh, you know, it's a process."

Oh. That's a little bit better. Step back and get ready to witness some real kicking. (He kicks the ball perfectly, and the ball goes into a tree. A bird falls out.) I did it! I did it! (The Kickinator kicks his chin again and he falls on his back.) I still did it!"

2,13,Isabella,That's nice.
2,13,Candace,Pfft.
2,13,Thaddeus,"What you architectural illiterates see here is a split-level edifice, complete with slide and licorice dispenser. (He pushes a button and a piece of red licorice comes out.) Huh? What?"
2,13,Candace,"(on megaphone) People, people, I'm not gonna soft pedal this. That was adequate, but I think we're ready to witness the greatest architectural feat this town has ever seen! I give you Phineas and Ferb!"

2,13,Phineas,Tada! (the kickball hits the fort) Our modern take on a well-known classic!
2,13,Doofenshmirtz,"I...I did it. I did it! Ha ha! Who's the loser now, huh?! L-O-S-E-R! Who's the loser?! You are! Let's boogie! That's right! Let's boogie!"

2,13,Candace,(smiles) Could it be true?!
2,13,Linda,"(offscreen) Candace, have you seen this?"

2,13,Doofenshmirtz,"Ooooh, I just felt a disturbance in the cup-stacking universe. I think my record's been broken."
2,13,Linda,"That wasn't so hard, now, was it?"
2,13,Candace,"(smiles, grabbing her mother) Mom, let's go, let's go, let's go! (Cut to outside) Mom, I've been trying to tell you all summer! They make these amazing things! Look!"
2,13,Linda,"Candace, you're right! It is amazing!"
2,13,Phineas,"Hey, Mom, we've built a fort."
2,13,Linda,It's wonderful! (to Candace) Isn't it great? The boys are starting to take an interest in building things. (goes back into the house) Who wants stuff?
2,13,Phineas,(offscreen) We do!
2,11,Buford,See? Isn't this the coolest game ever? It's called Jump and Duck.
2,11,Phineas,"Hey, how'd you get your face in there?"
2,11,Buford,"Easy. I just use this camera, see? (takes picture of Phineas)"
2,11,Phineas,(with spinning eyes) Cool.
2,11,Buford,"(demonstrating how to add in the picture, tilting the game controller and wildly pushing buttons) And then you do this, and this, and this and this and this and this and this, and this, and this, and this, and this and this, and then this and this, and then that."
2,11,Buford,Look!
2,11,Phineas,This is awesome.
2,11,Candace,"(on her cell phone) Stacy, you are talking to the luckiest girl in the house. Jeremy is taking me to the summer cotillion! Cotillion. It's like a dance. Yes, it's a real word. All I know is it's gonna be great. Wait, I just thought of something, two somethings actually. And one of them is pointy. Stacy, I'll call you back. It's time for a little preemptive bust."
2,11,Phineas,"So, beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game?"
2,11,Buford,It's called Jump and Duck. Duh.
2,11,Baljeet,I can see no educational value in this game.
2,11,Buford,(at Baljeet) Duck!
2,11,Buford,(Laughing) Consider yourself educated.
2,11,Baljeet,I stand corrected.
2,11,Phineas,"Far be it for me to cast dispersions on jumping, and or ducking, but I think you can improve this. With a little effort we could-"
2,11,Candace,(Now in the backyard) Okay. What are you guys up to?
2,11,Phineas,Playing a video game.
2,11,Candace,That's it? That's all you're doing today? Huh. How normal. I guess my night's safe after all. Who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game? I'm going to go get ready.
2,11,Phineas,"(Angelic chorus in the background) ""Sucked into a video game"". Brilliant! Ferb! I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,11,Major Monogram,"Good morning Agent P. I've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's internet activity. First, we know what you're getting for Christmas. Don't ask our lips are sealed... it's a vase. Second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all, Velour. Ugh! (Monogram shudders, and the feed cuts out)"
2,11,Background singers,♪ Perry! ♪
2,11,Phineas,"Introducing the all new and improved, Jump and Duck. The world's first truly immersive video game experience. Hey Ferb, throw the switch."
2,11,Candace,(in her room) Hey!
2,11,Phineas,And once your zapped into the video game by the digitizer-
2,11,Candace,"Okay, what's going on? I was drying my hair."
2,11,Phineas,"Sorry about the power, Candace. Ferb went to check the circuit breaker."
2,11,Candace,Jeremy is going to get here any...
2,11,Candace,(in the video game) ...minute. Hey! Where'd you guys go?
2,11,Phineas,"We didn't go anywhere, but you're inside the video game."
2,11,Candace,What do you mean I'm in the... (Birds and angry fruit begin chasing Candace)
2,11,Phineas,"Wow, cool. How come she got to go first?"
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, you are too late. Wait, is it eleven o'clock yet? (Pauses for a beat) Now! Now you are too late. So Perry the Platypus, tremble in fear before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known! The ball gown-inator. (Doofenshmirtz grabs the Ball gown-inator, and fires it at Perry, leaving him in a ball gown. Perry tries to jump at Doofenshmirtz, but falls due to his ball gown. A pair of mechanical arms pick of Perry so that he is at Doofenshmirtz's level) See, Perry the Platypus? It's hard to fight when you're in a ball gown. It's portable too. Ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion. It's a word, it means dance. So, why would I created such a device as this?"
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"(Narrating) You see, back in Gimmelshtump in the depths of my childhood, my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, I was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year. Drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates."
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Now with my ball gown-inator, I will be the manliest man in the Tri-State Area! You know, by comparison. Because everyone else will be wearing dress. After I shoot them with my ball gown-inator. Am, am I over explaining this? Because I have this whole musical number prepared, and... Oh, oh you're good. (at the dancers) Take five girls."
2,11,Candace,You guys better get me out of here. I still have to get ready.
2,11,Phineas,"Well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss, but you know just, just continue screen right."
2,11,Candace,Can't you just press a button and get me there now?
2,11,Phineas,"Oh, you want cheat codes. No, we don't roll like that. Just jump and Duck. (Candace gets hit by fruits) Okay not necessarily in that order. Just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the approaching fruit."
2,11,Phineas,"Duck! (Candace got hit by the door) Now run! (Candace gets hit by a ramp) Duck! (Candace's head got sucked) Okay, you can try to jump here (Candace fall on a platform) Duck! Duck! Duck! (Candace falls on the stairs) Okay stop falling Candace keeps falling) stop falling (Candace keeps falling) (talking to Ferb) Sheesh. Maybe we should go help her. Don't worry Candace, we're coming!"
2,11,Candace,"Hmm, maybe they should call it Jump, Duck, and Blow (Candace then begins to run through the world, shooting everything in her path)"
2,11,Phineas,"Whoa, what happened here? Oh that's right, Candace has her hair dryer. We'll just follow the carnage."
2,11,(Song,Let's Go Digital)
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"You know, Perry the Platypus, that dress sort of suites you. If you know, you just eventuate the positive as they say... Um, I'm going to stop talking now, I'm moving into a weird-"
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"(Muffled by Perry's dress) Hey what the...? What going on here I got... Oh, it's on now!"
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"(Hanging under the balloon) Oh great, now everyone's staring."
2,11,Phineas,"Wow, the castle. Nice art direction, Ferb. I guess Candace already made it to the boss level. (The boss, designed after Buford appears behind them) Sweet! Come on."
2,11,Phineas,"I forgot that we made Buford the boss. It's a little disturbing having him trying to obliterate us, but it made him so happy."
2,11,Candace,"Hey ugly! Drop the twerps you freak. (The Boss does so, and walks toward Candace) Nobody picks on my brothers but- (The bosses knocks Candace over, causing her to lose the hair dryer, and diminishing her health)"
2,11,Phineas,Candace look out!
2,11,Phineas,"Alright Candace, way to--"
2,11,Candace,Phineas! Ferb! Phineas! Ferb! (The two brothers dissolve) NOOOO!!!!
2,11,Phineas,"Hey Candace, what's the matter?"
2,11,Candace,You guys are okay?
2,11,Phineas,"Well yeah, we have, like four lives left."
2,11,Candace,"Wait. You guys let me believe you were really dead? If we ever get out of here you're going to be so... Hey, what's going on?"
2,11,Phineas,"Awesome, we're out. So you must have beat the boss."
2,11,Candace,"Yeah, it was a piece of cake."
2,11,Phineas,"Cool, how'd you get him the second time?"
2,11,Candace,"What do you mean, ""second time""?"
2,11,Phineas,"You know how after you defeat him the first time, he comes back, and this time he's twice as strong? What'd you do then?"
2,11,Candace,Um...
2,11,Phineas,The last level's in the real world. Run!
2,11,Buford,"No guys, he looks like a nice guy."
2,11,Buford,"Okay, maybe not."
2,11,Baljeet,"(Mockingly) Oh, now I see the educational value."
2,11,Buford,"(Glaring) You know, eventually I'm getting out of here!"
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Hehe, exactly as planned."
2,11,Isabella,(From behind the boss) Hey you!
2,11,Phineas,Isabella! No!
2,11,Isabella,Leave my friends alone!
2,11,Phineas,NOOOO!
2,11,Isabella,(Takes out a camera) Smile.
2,11,Phineas,"Wow, Isabella, that was great."
2,11,Isabella,"You know what they say, the bigger they are the harder they de-pixelate."
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,Sea-Foam-Green? I'm actually more of an Autumn.
2,11,Jeremy,(In the distance) Candace.
2,11,Candace,Oh no! Jeremy's here. How am I going to get ready in three seconds?
2,11,Ferb,"Apparently, do what we did."
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,No!
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,Curse you Perry the Platypus!
2,11,Phineas,I don't remember changing. Is this part of the gam-
2,11,Phineas,"Oh, there you are Perry."
2,11,Candace,Well what am I going to do!?
2,11,Candace,Huh?
2,11,Jeremy,"Wow, you look beautiful. ... I guess you all look beautiful."
2,11,Phineas,"Thanks, we think it's part of the game."
2,11,Jeremy,"...Okay. Shall we go, Candace?"
2,11,Candace,Uh...yes.
2,11,Jeremy,Why do they call it a cotillion anyway?
2,11,Candace,"Oh, don't get me started."
2,11,Cotillion Crowner,...And the queen of the summer cotillion is...
2,11,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh I am honored. And at the same time humiliated, so thank you and curse you."
2,39,Phineas,"Wow, Aunt Tiana, you and Bob have had so many cool adventures."
2,39,Tiana,"I know huh? And here's a picture of Bob and me jumping out of a helicopter into the South American rainforest. Turn the page, Bob."
2,39,Bob,Okay!
2,39,Tiana,"Oh, here's where we dodged all those man eating plants in the Amazon. Bob?"
2,39,Bob,Okay!
2,39,Tiana,"And here we are climbing the icy peaks of Kilimanjaro. I thought the view was just spectacular, but Bob was just--"
2,39,Bob,"Eh, okay."
2,39,Phineas,Where ya going next?
2,39,Tiana,To the Galapagos. We leave tomorrow.
2,39,Bob,"You know, we’ve been on so many trips together, this time, I want to go with someone else..."
2,39,Bob,"...My wife. Tiana, will you marry me?"
2,39,Tiana,Okay!
2,39,Linda,How romantic.
2,39,Lawrence,Way to go Bob.
2,39,Phineas,"Wow, corny. But apparently effective."
2,39,Linda,You could get married in the Galapagos!
2,39,Candace,"No! You can't get married in the Galapagos. When I was little, you promised me that I would be your bridesmaid. What about my needs?"
2,39,Linda,Candace!
2,39,Tiana,"Oh, that's right. I did promise you that, didn't I? Well, we could go to the courthouse before we leave."
2,39,Bob,Okay!
2,39,Candace,"No, not okay! We have to have a real wedding. We can have it in the backyard!"
2,39,Linda,"Candace, you can't plan a real wedding in a day."
2,39,Candace,"Duh! (Rushes off and comes back wearing a dress) I've been planning this since I was 10! I could set up the perfect wedding and get you two kids married in a way you'll never forget, and have you on the plane to the Galapagos with time to spare. Now you and mom go to the salon to get up-dos, and French manicures. Then head to Tri-State Bridal and ask for Oga. Now go!"
2,39,Linda,"Okay then, wouldn't want Aunt Tiana taking her vows in safari wear!"
2,39,Tiana,"Candace, I know you're going to plan a wonderful wedding, especially with Phineas and Ferb helping."
2,39,Candace,What?!
2,39,Phineas,"Right! Ferb, I know what we're going to do--"
2,39,Candace,"No, no no no. You don't know what you’re going to do today. They're going to build some sort of wedding rocket to the moon, or lawn gnome beach party of taffeta!"
2,39,Tiana,"Then you steer the boys in the right direction, and have fun, okay?"
2,39,Bob,"(Off screen, distant) Okay!"
2,39,Phineas,(At Ferb) Lawn gnome beach party of taffeta. Make a note of that.
2,39,Candace,"(At phone) Hello? Lake's Cakes? I'd like a 7-tiered.... Oh no, make that 10-tiered white cake with raspberry filled... (Beep) Please hold. (Click) Yes, Flowers? Oh, yes, I need something with smell... (Beep) Oh um, please hold. (Click) I'm back. I want something with cinnamon..."
2,39,Phineas,"Hey, sis."
2,39,Candace,"Excuse me. (At Phineas and Ferb) Can't you see I'm busy? (At phone) Yes, I'm still here. Hold please! (At Phineas and Ferb) Will you two scram?"
2,39,Phineas,"Well, Ferb and I wanted to see how we could help."
2,39,Candace,"Just go do something and get out of my way! (At phone) Huh? Oh no, not you. It's my... (At Phineas and Ferb) Go plan the grand entrance!"
2,39,Phineas,"Okay! (At Ferb) I guess we could make an entrance that's kinda grand. (Pause) So, have you seen Perry?"
2,39,Major Monogram,♪ I wanna wanna wanna have fun fun fun ♪
2,39,Candace,"(At phone) No; I said crab puffs! (Beep) Please hold. (Click) Why would I want my cake in a vase? Oh, you're the florist, not the baker."
2,39,Phineas,"(Off screen) Alright ladies, let's do a run through!"
2,39,Phineas,"(Through helicopter noise) Looking good Isabella! (Candace comes to the backyard) Oh, hey, sis!"
2,39,Isabella,"(Parachuting down from the helicopter) Hey, Candace!"
2,39,Phineas,"See Aunt Tiana, Bob, and the wedding photographer will parachute into their wedding, just like they did in South America. At the helicopters) Let's bring those puppies back down. We want to save our fuel for the actual grand entrance!"
2,39,Candace,"Absolutely not! You are off grand entrance duty. Just go take care of the flowers, while I order the cake. Got it?"
2,39,Phineas,"Well, I guess we could--"
2,39,Candace,Just do it! And don’t interrupt me. (Walks away)
2,39,Phineas,"Wow, she's good. I'm going to have her plan my wedding. Ferb, make a note."
2,39,Isabella,(Off screen) I got it!
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Surprise, Perry the Platypus! (Giggles madly) Okay, (Presses elevator button) enjoy your trip! (Giggles again) Oh, oh, the look on his face was priceless, (Giggles) Oh, here he comes back. Alright, try not to laugh, okay. Ahaha, did you enjoy the other floor—Wait, Perry? (Second elevator door opens revealing Perry) Perry the Platypus? (Goes inside the elevator) Huh, where did he go?"
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, (Groans) No!"
2,39,Candace,"No, no, not beef, chicken! Oh, you're the cake guy? (Beep) Oh, hold please. (Click) What? No I don't want to save money on my car insurance."
2,39,Phineas,Candace!
2,39,Candace,"I told you not to interrupt me. (At phone) Not you, don't hang up. (At Phineas and Ferb) This better be good!"
2,39,Phineas,Ferb and I just thought you'd like to see how the flowers turned out.
2,39,Candace,"Oh! Why didn’t you say so? (Walks into the backyard) Oh wow, this is so beautiful—Wait a minute, are these--?"
2,39,Phineas,Venus flytraps! Just like in their adventure in the Amazon.
2,39,Phineas,"Don’t worry Candace, they only have a taste for insects and small vermin. (Flytrap latches onto Candace’s head) Hey, he likes you!"
2,39,Candace,Get this thing off me!
2,39,Phineas,(Removing the Venus flytrap off Candace) Are you okay?
2,39,Candace,One moment. (Dials on her phone)
2,39,Linda,"Hello? (Candace screams through the phone; Linda hangs up) So, are you and Bob thinking of having kids?"
2,39,Phineas,"So, what can we do next?"
2,39,Candace,Next? What can you do next?!
2,39,Phineas,"Well, Aunt Tiana said that we should help, and it is her wedding when you think about it."
2,39,Candace,"Alright. But! No trampolines, no robots, no rollercoasters, no firework spectaculars, no native dancers, no running of the wildebeests--"
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"(Walking into his apartment) You could have at least gotten into your trap. It's on the table. (Perry ties himself up) You know, I do appreciate you trying to mix it up, but I do have a schedule to keep. Ready? Let me show you my latest project. The Junk Food-inator! It sprays my special mix of boiling hot high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated coconut oil. To turn all healthy food into toasty warm junk food! Soon, everyone will become lethargic overweight blobs. Easily controlled by me! (Laughs) Because I will be the only one left eating healthy food, like these delicious broccolis! (Eats) Mm, well, the only problem is, I'm not quite used to the taste—- I'm used to eating the junk. I'll just dip it in here (Dips broccoli into the Junk Food-inator and eats it) Mmm, Oh that's much better! I could eat this all day. I can feel myself getting healthier."
2,39,Candace,"--No giant robot groomsmen, no mechanized rice catapults, no rocket to the moon, no bringing the moon down to earth, just regular good old fashion wedding stuff like you might find at a regular everyday perfect wedding."
2,39,Phineas,Like?
2,39,Candace,"Like—- Ice! It's summer, it's hot, people want something with ice, okay? Make ice."
2,39,Phineas,"Ferb, what do we have in the ice file?"
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"I could eat this stuff all day. Just look at this lifelike glow I've acquired. I'm the picture of health! And all from eating nothing but this... ah, I don't know what's under here, but I think it's a vegetable. I'm as strong as an ox! (Squelching noise as his stomach pops out from his shirt. Doofenshmirtz breathes out heavily as he gets tired) But nobody else will be after fire off my Junk Food-inator. (Machine rumbles, but stops, having run out of corn syrup and coconut oil) I should really refill this. But you know (Yawns) I'm so tired. I should really take a nap first. (Falls over into Junk Food-inator and starts snoring)"
2,39,Delivery Man,"Yeah, the cakes all set up out back just like you asked."
2,39,Candace,Thank you!
2,39,Delivery Man,"Hey, aren't you a little too young to be a wedding planner—Oof!"
2,39,Candace,"No! (Slams door) No, I'm not! (Rushes out back) My perfect cake done! (She unveils the cake to have the strangest assortment of tiers, ranging from fish bones to a chicken cage at the bottom) No! My perfect cake! Mr. Delivery guy, come back! (Candace runs past a window only to come back to see her disheveled appearance) The horror."
2,39,Phineas,Hey Candace! What do you think of our ice sculpture? We incorporated all of Aunt Tiana's and Bob's adventures. There's even a slide she can ride down to the altar.
2,39,Isabella and Ginger,(Sliding down) I do!
2,39,Candace,"(Sobbing) I'm telling-- (Car honks) Mom! Maybe it's my perfect day after all! Mom! Aunt Tiana, hurry up, you've got to see this thing."
2,39,Tiana,Is she always like that?
2,39,Linda,Some days are better than others!
2,39,Candace,(Hopping up and down) It's Phineas and Ferb! They've ruined everything!
2,39,Linda,I'll go check on Lawrence and Bob.
2,39,Tiana,"Candace, let's go have a look."
2,39,Candace,"(Rushing to the backyard) Look at this cake, it has a chicken in it! (Chicken noise)"
2,39,Tiana,Oh...
2,39,Candace,And my hair! I think it may also have a chicken in it!
2,39,Tiana,Oh my...
2,39,Candace,And this! (Gestures to the enormous ice sculpture)
2,39,Phineas,"Hi, Auntie T! We're just putting the finishing touches on the scorpions. Look! The venom is sparkling apple cider!"
2,39,Tiana,"Oh my goodness. Candace, I- I..."
2,39,Candace,"Don't say it, Auntie T, I failed you! I turned your special day into the worst wedding ever!"
2,39,Tiana,(In tears) But I love it.
2,39,Candace,You huh?
2,39,Tiana,"I mean your hair, it's all the rage down in Montevideo. And the cake! It's like a crazy hodgepodge of everything I love. And this! Wow, all I can say is, (Hugging Candace) thank you. You planned a perfect wedding. Now why don't you come inside and help me with my dress?"
2,39,Candace,Oh yay!
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"(Waking up to Perry’s chatter) Wait, what, who am I? Oh, oh, it’s me! Perry the Platypus, how did you free yourself?"
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"Wow. But it's too late! While I was napping, enough grease dripped off my face to fill the Junk Food-inator. Nothing can stop me now! Hoo, I gotta sit down."
2,39,Doofenshmirtz,"What the--? (Scorpion collides into the -Inator) Suddenly I feel like a glass of apple cider. I don’t know how you did that, but get ready to pay, Perry the Platypus! (Stomach growls) Uh, can you hold on one second? (Goes to washroom; toilet flushes) Okay, here we are, let’s do this-- (Stomach growls) Uh, uh, you know, just hold on. (Door closes) Ah you know Perry the Platypus, uh, you can just let yourself out. I...I may be a while."
2,39,Candace,(offscreen) Are you ready Aunt Tiana?
2,39,Tiana,"Wow, you even made it snow! Wait, what about the ice sculpture with all our great adventures?"
2,39,Ferb,They say the step you’re about to take is the beginning of your greatest adventure yet.

2,38,Lawrence,"Well, your mother's jazz trio has a gig at the Mayor's Day festivities, and I shall be running the antiques auction, oh yes! I'm very excited because we have a collection of steamrollers on the block, all imported from England."
2,38,Candace,You're kidding. There's a market for that?
2,38,Lawrence,"Oh, you'd be surprised, what with Steamroller Today magazine and Wacky Steamroller videos posted on the Internet. The public is going crazy for the flattening arts."

2,38,Major Monogram,"Morning, Agent P. How do you like the new spitoon lair entrance? (Beat) Anyway, your mission. Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz is being honored today with a statue at the Mayor's Day Festival. (Background of screen becomes a weather map with Heinz's and Roger's faces on it.) Considering Doofenshmirtz's hatred for his brother, the forecast suggests mild tomfoolery with a sixty percent chance of slapstick violence. Good luck, Agent P. Now on to Tom Perkins with sports."
2,38,Phineas,"We're done, Ferb."
2,38,Isabella,Whatcha doin'?
2,38,Phineas,We just built a device that temporarily scrambles your molecules so you can pass through solid objects. Let's see if it works.

2,38,Bobbi Fabulous,Now listen up...
2,38,Phineas,"Hey we almost forgot, we have to get that pick for Mom! I'll be right back. (phases through wall)"
2,38,Candace,"So I asked Jeremy if he was going to the festival and he's like ""Yeah, are you going to the festival?"" and then I go...(She notices Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, and Buford staring at the blank wall that Phineas passed through)"
2,38,Candace,Hey...
2,38,"Ferb, Isabella, Baljeet, Buford",(without looking around) Hey.
2,38,Phineas,Got it.
2,38,Candace,(drops the apple in her hand in shock) ...Call you back Stacy.
2,38,Phineas,"(puts ball on the table) Hey Candace, we're heading out to the festival. See ya!"
2,38,Candace,(takes out phone and dials) Mom?
2,38,Linda,(on stage at the festival) Hello? Candace?
2,38,Candace,"Mom, I know this sounds crazy. I mean, no crazier than all my other calls. You've got a gig, you're upset about losing your lucky pick. Like, you're going to come home now and see what I'm rambling on about. No, you know, I should bring the ball to you! Yeah that's a good idea. Mom, forget this call ever happened. Bye! (hangs up)"
2,38,Linda,(deafened by the music) What?
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(talking to a Perry bobblehead) You see bobblehead Perry the Platypus, I have created a powerful -inator that will deface anything it contacts! Including my brother Roger's statue that's being unveiled at today's festival. It's going to humiliate him! Isn't that genius, bobblehead Perry the Platypus? (flicks the bobblehead)"
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(seeing the bobblehead bounce) Oh yes, so you agree. You know, I miss our little talks, don't you? Oh, what do you know anyway? (throws bobblehead out the back window)"
2,38,Candace,(picks up the phasing ball) Walk through walls eh?
2,38,Candace,"Okay, now I'm mad. (activates the ball and walks through the wall) You've outdone yourselves boys. Wait 'til Mom sees this."
2,38,Roger Doofenshmirtz,"Citizens of Danville, it is an honor to be your mayor and a pleasure to serve."
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(getting out of the microbus) Oh, no, Roger, it is I who will be serving you."
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Hm... okay, push up and..."
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Those are my keys, aren't they? (On the phone) No, I don't have my card. Yes, the keys are still in there and it's running. (Engine shudders to a stop.) Okay, now it's not running; now I need gas... Forty-five minutes huh?... (Sighs) Well I'm not going anywhere. (Puts phone away) Eh, well at least I can get my -inator. (Aims the -inator.)"
2,38,Roger Doofenshmirtz,As we get closer to unveiling this perfect replica of my body...
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,Perry the Plat...! (gets punched by Perry) Hey!
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,What? That's a... it's an arts and crafts project! I've got a life outside of you!
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,Curse you Perry the bobblehead!
2,38,Isabella,"Oh no! Bummer, I have a flat!"
2,38,Phineas,"No problem, we can fix it."
2,38,Lawrence,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting to bid on. I give you, the antique steamrollers! (crowd cheers)"
2,38,Crowd member,They're so beautiful! (cries)
2,38,Wilbur Wilkins,Steamrollers stink!
2,38,Orville Wilkins,"Yeah, pump trolleys rule!"
2,38,Old lady,(gasps) It's the Wilkins brothers!
2,38,Old man,Just ignore them Arlene. They try to cause trouble at every steam-powered antique auction in the Tri-State Area.
2,38,Lawrence,Shall we start the bidding?
2,38,Phineas,Hey Candace!
2,38,Candace,"Enjoy your last moments of freedom, boys!"
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, you might have destroyed Plan A, but behold! (Another -inator rises from the bus) Plan B! (Pushes a button and the -inator explodes) Which I have just destroyed, so now we're even. But not even I am prepared for Plan C! (Third -inator rises from the flatbed) Behold! The Be-Gone-Inator! How do you like me now Perry the Gone-a-pus?"
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"Eh, so I missed. Oh whatever, I have a bigger bother to be-gone. Goodbye, stupid Roger statue!"
2,38,Lawrence,And Lot Number 2 is a little beaut from Aveling & Porter built in 1924. Do I have any bids?
2,38,Crowd,I do! I do! I do! Here!
2,38,Orville Wilkins,Nobody's paying a lick of attention to us Wilbur.
2,38,Wilbur Wilkins,Yeah! Let's get out of here.
2,38,Baljeet,(Impatiently) So how long does it take you to fix a flat? Tick tock!
2,38,Candace,(Running through the festival) Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through!
2,38,Baljeet,"Aghh! You can build a rollercoaster in a day, but it takes you 12 minutes to pump up a tire?"
2,38,Baljeet,Did anybody else just see the inside of a steamroller?
2,38,Buford,How do you know what the inside of a steamroller looks like?
2,38,Baljeet,I have a life outside of you!
2,38,Phineas,"Well, the tire's fixed."
2,38,Lawrence,And Lot Number 5 is sold to the woman in red. And now the last item of the day: we have Lot 6. Do I have any bids?
2,38,Candace,"(struggling to get the door off of the porta potty stall, while Balthazar gives her a high five) Mom!"
2,38,Candace,Mom!
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,Hmm... what are the odds?
2,38,Phineas,Hey mom! I'm glad we caught you. Ferb and I found your lucky gold pick.
2,38,Linda,Oh boys! Thank you! What a relief; I just hate playing without it.
2,38,Candace,Mom! Mom! Look at this! Look at me!
2,38,Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro,Linda! We're on!
2,38,Candace,Mom!
2,38,Linda,"Candace, I've gotta go. And just because I won't let you get pink hair, you don't have to wear some weird door. The trends these days..."
2,38,Candace,"But, but!"
2,38,Phineas,(walking away) Cool door Candace. (to the others) Let's get a good spot.
2,38,Buford,"I'd wear a door. Heck, I'd even wear a window if it'd fit."
2,38,Jeremy,(walking past the group) Hey guys.
2,38,Candace,Oh no! Jeremy!
2,38,Jeremy,You seen Candace?
2,38,Phineas,She's standing in the door.
2,38,Jeremy,Thanks.
2,38,Candace,Oh no! Oh no! Jeremy can't see me like this. Oh my g..! Oh no! (winds the door's toilet paper around her head)
2,38,Jeremy,Candace?
2,38,Candace,"...and four. And breathe. Whew, just doing some stretching. Oh hi Jeremy!"
2,38,Jeremy,"So, our moms are going to start playing when they unveil the statue. Wanna go?"
2,38,Candace,(dreamily) Sure.
2,38,Roger Doofenshmirtz,"And now, without further ado! (Statue is unveiled; crowd cheers; band starts playing.)"
2,38,Phineas,"Well Ferb, it looks like everything worked out for everyone today."
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,"(standing with Perry on his flatbed, balanced on the edge of the cliff) I can't believe nothing worked out for me today. After... I.. I had a A, B, and C and they all... 'course I destroyed the B so..."
2,38,Doofenshmirtz,Hey where are you going? Curse you Perry the Platypus! (Rolls past the Wilkins brothers)

2,10,Phineas,"Well, Ferb, time to make the sunniest day ever!"
2,10,Phineas,"I guess it's already as sunny as it's gonna get. (He and Ferb climbs down the tree.) Wow, it's not even lunchtime and we're already done with today's project. Think about it, Ferb."
2,10,Phineas,That means we have the whole rest of the day...
2,10,Phineas,...to do another project.
2,10,Phineas,It's like having two days in one! (slides down the tree trunk) Can't ask for better than that.
2,10,Phineas,"Hey, Perry, do you have any cool ideas for projects?"
2,10,Phineas,"That's an egg. Perry laid an egg! You know what this means, don't you? We're gonna have two Perrys! Congratulations, old boy! You're gonna be a... Hey, where's Perry?"
2,10,Major Monogram,How did you like our new pneumatic transporter? I used it myself this morning.
2,10,Major Monogram,"What? (Camera pans back to him) Oh, who am I kidding? The new pneumatic transporter sucks. I mean, literally, sucked every piece of hair off my body. Anyhoo, Doofenshmitz has brought up the Tri-State's entire supply of krill. Krill?"

2,10,Major Monogram,(scoffs) ..Krill.
2,10,Phineas,"You know, Ferb, Perry's egg is getting kind of cold."
2,10,Phineas,"(shakes his head) No, I don't think that's gonna cut it. This calls for desperate measures. (Ferb takes the egg) We need the ultimate, best-ever egg hatcher. Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today."

2,10,Candace,Whoa! Cool!

2,10,Announcer,"Sadly, the sea hawk wins this battle. Unlike humans, sea turtles don't have a mother to protect them through these crucial moments of infancy."
2,10,Candace,What's that?
2,10,Phineas,"(while Candace runs into the backyard) Hey, Candace, Perry laid an egg!"
2,10,Candace,"(picks up the egg) It's okay, little guy. Candace is here to protect you! (at the boys) What are you doing to this precious gift of life?"
2,10,Phineas,"After Perry left his egg unattended, we decided it would be best if we watched over it for him. Given the rudimentary needs of the average egg, we calculated the heat transfer due to elemental exposure, plus the positive developing life responses to familiar and expected sound, and factored the obvious visual surroundings. The result was the Plat-a-Droid, but since we were pressed for time, we only built the platy-posterior."
2,10,Candace,"(after a pause) That's so wrong in so many ways, I don't even know where to start! An egg is like a little baby. It needs a living, breathing mother. It needs... Hold on one second."
2,10,Candace,"(now wearing her ""mom"" suit) Okay, let's do this thing for real!"
2,10,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus! You're just in time for my backstory. You see, it all started a lifetime ago."
2,10,Doofenshmirtz,"(voice over) I was young and in love with a beautiful girl. She taught me how to see the beauty of life, and I taught her how to hold a petty grudge. She was very interested in whales, for some reason. In retrospect, it was probably more of an unhealthy obsession, but to win her heart, I created the Whale Translator-inator! I rented the best oceanographic vessel that I could afford, and we headed out. But when I turned the Translator-inator on..."
2,10,Whale,(via the Translator-inator) ..What a loser that guy up there is! She should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me.
2,10,Doofenshmirtz,"(voice over) She left me for that trash-talking 35-ton pile of blubber. And broke my fragile, 10-ounce utterly-too-human heart."
2,10,Doofenshmirtz,"Unfortunately, my Translator-inator only worked in one direction. So I was not able to tell the whales what I thought of them. Until today. Watch this. (mimics whale cry) See, I taught myself whale song. I just told him he's fat, and he has barnacle breath."
2,10,Doofenshmirtz,"Come on, come on, who's diabolical?"
2,10,Candace,"Okay, first things first. Dismantle that thingamajig of... of weirdness. Sometimes, I swear, I'm the only normal one in this family. (pause) Like I said. Weirdness. Now, let's get serious. See what I'm wearing here? Serious. This egg's not gonna hatch itself. We need to build a nursery."
2,10,Phineas,We have this cool blueprint for an incubator!

2,28,Fireside Girls,"Aye-aye, Captain!"
2,28,Isabella,"All right, ladies! Lean!"
2,28,Fireside Girls,Lean!

2,28,Isabella,"Oh, no, we're not. Everybody... lean! (They all lean on the port side of the van, causing it to spiral down to the ground. As it lowers, it snaps the wire on Pinky's grappling hook. The van lands successfully on the ground. The Fireside Girls cheer.)"
2,28,Isabella,"Okay, girls. It's time to tap that sap!"
2,28,Katie,I'm on it!
2,28,Holly,"Hold it still, Katie. (She captures the sap in a test tube) We got it, Isabella!"

2,14,Candace,"Okay, Stacy. We've got about ten minutes until Jeremy's party, so you've gotta help me decide. Should I go with this swimsuit or this swimsuit? (Pulls out two swimsuits, only very slightly different colors)"
2,14,Stacy,"Hmm, that's tough. One on hand, if you go with the achromatic pink, it kinda says ""Hi, I'm Candace, and I'm bedraggled and pallid"". Trust me, you don't want that. I've been both. But, if you go with the more saturated pink, it kinda gives you that ""overkill, out-to-kill, my currency is urgency"" look."
2,14,Candace,I don't want that. I've been all three.
2,14,Stacy,Let your subconscious do the deciding. Go with the one you touched first.
2,14,Candace,"Of course! Stacy, you're a fashion phenom."
2,14,Stacy,(Holding a sunflower hat and a fez) Which hat should I go with?
2,14,Candace,I don't think it matters.
2,14,Stacy,"Yeah, you're right, I fuss too much."
2,14,Phineas,(Eating breakfast) Nothing starts off a day better than some breakfast and some education.
2,14,TV announcer,"(On television) We now return to ""Wacky Millionaires Throughout History"". Howard Hughes is probably best known for building the Spruce Goose, so-called because of its wooden frame. With a wingspan of 319 feet 11 inches, it still holds the record for being the largest plane ever built."
2,14,Phineas,"Wow, that's an impressive record. 319 feet 11 inches is just over the length of a football field, and only one afternoon away from being broken. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
2,14,Isabella,Hey guys. Whatcha doin?
2,14,Phineas,We're makin' the biggest airplane ever!
2,14,Isabella,"Cool! Coincidentally, we're going for our aeronautics patches."
2,14,Phineas,"Coincidentally, we could use extra hands."
2,14,Isabella,"Coincidentally, we're in."
2,14,Phineas,We're making our plane out of paper mache with newspaper!
2,14,Isabella,Why? To make sure it's newsworthy?
2,14,Phineas,(Gang laughs) And red all over!
2,14,Buford,"(Gang laughs) Oh! Oh, oh, hah, and funny! (Everyone stares at him blankly) Hahahahaha! And funny! You know, 'cause, 'cause, the funnies! Hehe..."
2,14,Phineas,"But seriously, Howard Hughes called his plane the Spruce Goose, 'cause it was made of wood. So, we're gonna call ours ""The Paper Pelican"", 'cause it's made of newspaper! You know, so it will have a good circulation!"
2,14,Buford,"Aw, come on!"
2,14,Phineas,"Hey, where's Perry?"
2,14,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P. We just discovered Doofenshmirtz has been stealing bottles from recycling bins, and nothing good can come from that. (Photo of Doofenshmirtz digging through trash cans appears on the monitor) Unless, of course, he's recycling, in which case nothing but good can come from that. Unless, he's recycling it into some hideous weapon, which is something once again no good could come from. Except, of course, for the recycling part, which I guess is still at its essence, good. Even if you're making something evil, it's still reducing the... You know, you know, perhaps we shouldn't even put these good and evil labels on things. Let's just say Doofenshmirtz is doing something neutral. So, just get out there and make sure it stays like that. (Agent P disappears)"
2,14,Lawrence,Huh?
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,"(The wall flips and Agent P appears) Perry the Platypus? (phone rings) Hello? It's for you, Perry the Platypus. (He ties the phone cord around Agent P) Ha ha, prank call! Now say hello to my new evil weapon: My Evaporator-inator! It's made completely out of recycled materials. It's green... (takes off lab coat to show a recycling sign and ""greevil"" letters on it in green) ...and evil! I call it, ""Greevil."" (laughs) Backstory time! You see Perry the Platypus, when I was a young boy, my mother would never let me swim in public pools."
2,14,Mrs. Doofenshmirtz,No.
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,"What? That's it! You know, not every backstory has to have some big in-depth spiel, Mr. High Expectations!"
2,14,Stacy,Wait... (looks at watch) Now! We're exactly fashionably late! (people talking) We're here! This is gonna be so cool!
2,14,Candace,Hey!
2,14,Stacy,"Yeah, totally hey!"
2,14,Jeremy,(laughs) That is so cool.
2,14,Candace,Who's that Jeremy's talking to?
2,14,Stacy,I have no idea. I've never seen her before in my life.
2,14,Candace,I thought Jeremy invited me to this party.
2,14,Stacy,Let's not jump to conclusions yet. (both crawl under everyone and pop up from behind a chair)
2,14,Candace,What is Jeremy doing with her?
2,14,Stacy,Slow down. Remember how you thought Jeremy was with a girl and she wasn't even a she? And then you ended up on that snowboard all out of control?
2,14,Candace,"Yeah, but she's obviously a real girl."
2,14,Nicolette,"So then I got two west African pit vipers, and had to dive off a 300-foot cliff, and swim up through a school of piranha."
2,14,Jeremy,"That's awesome, Nicolette."
2,14,Candace,"Stacy, it's conclusion-jumping-to-time. Strategy session, now! (both hide in bushes) She's amazing! She's all exotic and stuff! She has on the same bathing suit as me, only it's brighter and she wears it better. And she dives off cliffs holding poisonous snakes into piranha-infested water! What am I going to do? She's like catnip for boys! She's boynip!"
2,14,Phineas,"Nicely done, people. Hey, Baljeet, what are the stats on the Spruce Goose again?"
2,14,Baljeet,The Spruce Goose's wingspan is 319 feet 11 inches.
2,14,Phineas,And the Paper Pelican's wingspan is:
2,14,Baljeet,320 feet even!
2,14,Phineas,"Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes."
2,14,Both,Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.
2,14,Buford,You'd better have some decent grub on this bucket.
2,14,Baljeet,You will be most gratified. (Buford walks in) As long as you find insignificant bags of peanuts gratifying... (slaps himself) Welcome to Wedgieville. Population: me.
2,14,Phineas,"All right, Ferb. Let's go through our pre-flight checklist. Pilots instruments? Check. Copilot's instruments?"
2,14,Ferb,Check.
2,14,Phineas,"Looks like everything's a go, Ferb. Let's switch her on. Ignition! (pushes a button and the Paper Pelican starts to fly) Adjust angle of departure, check. (Paper Pelican flies off) We've reached cruising altitude. You are now free to move about the cabin."
2,14,Isabella,Would you like some peanuts?
2,14,Katie,"I'll take two packs, please."
2,14,Buford,That'd better not be insignificant bags of peanuts.
2,14,Baljeet,"No! Of course not, sir. (walks off; comes back with a chicken shaped out of peanuts) Here, sir. Try our deluxe peanut chicken. Our motto is: ""So peanutty, you will not even taste the chicken!"""
2,14,Buford,"I'd better not taste any chicken then, loser. (eats it) All right, you survive. For now."
2,14,Baljeet,"Oh, thank you, sir."
2,14,Stacy,What are you worrying about? You're Candace Flynn!
2,14,Candace,"Yeah, and she's super cool, foreign accent, snake wrestler, high-diving, natural hottie, Nicolette."
2,14,Stacy,Snake wrestler? Whatever. You've fought dinosaurs! You've been to Mars! You've traveled through time!
2,14,Candace,"Oh, yeah..."
2,14,Stacy,"And as for diving, you been perfecting that quintuple-somersault backflip-jacknife-swandive for a week now. You're Candace Flynn!"
2,14,Candace,Yeah! (She stands up) I'm Candace Flynn!
2,14,Jeremy,Candace?
2,14,Candace,"Oh, he remembers my name. How nice."
2,14,Isabella and Baljeet,"And now, for your in-flight entertainment; The Paper Pelican Floor Show!"
2,14,(Song,Big Ginormous Airplane)
2,14,Candace,From atop of the diving board) There's been a lot of talk around here about diving and snakes and diving with snakes and snakes into pools filled with piranha and sulfuric acid—
2,14,Nicolette,I didn't say anything about sulfuric acid.
2,14,Candace,Leave all questions to the end of the rant? Thank you.
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,"Now, say ""goodbye"" to splashy-pool time fun, forever! Even my power source is greevil. It's solar! Do you mind Perry the Platypus, this is real a two handed job. (He hangs the phone up on Perry. A panel in the floor rotates Perry to a plotted plant, then back to Perry, now free) Ah! Seriously- (Perry kicks Doofenshmirtz in the face, knocking his into his -inator, and firing it in an unintended direction)"
2,14,Candace,"Now, as I was saying before I was so lamely interrupted, I'm going to show everybody a real dare-devil dive. (The Beam from Doofenshmirtz's -inator hits the pool, evaporating it)"
2,14,Candace,"Oh, well that's just not fair!"
2,14,Party goer,Hey cool! It's like a half pipe!
2,14,Jeremy,All right!
2,14,Candace,"No! Wait! No! No, I've been practicing diving, not skateboarding! Ugh. Everybody stop doing things that I'm not good at!"
2,14,Candace,"Oh, this is a nightmare, come on Stacy, let's go-- (Candace steps on Jeremy's skateboard, and begins skating in the pool)"
2,14,Guy,Safety first! (He puts a helmet on Candace)
2,14,Jeremy,Whoa.
2,14,Guy 2,Safety first! (He gives her elbow and knee pads)
2,14,Guy 3,Safety first! (He hands Candace a steering wheel.
2,14,Candace,A steering wheel? How is this safe? (The airbag explodes in her face)
2,14,Jeremy,"Wow, Candace..."
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,That was your last highly-improbable judo maneuver Perry the Platypus. I will now evaporate-inate you into non existence!
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh no! my-my power source! Oh, great now I can't see a thing!"
2,14,Doofenshmirtz,Curse you Perry the Platypus.
2,14,Stacy,WooHoo! Yeah! Go Candace!
2,14,Candace,"(As she continues to skateboard out of control) Help me! (The Paper Pelican covers up the sun, turning everything dark) I can't see!"
2,14,Jeremy,Candace?
2,14,Phineas,This is your captain speaking; We're beginning our decent.
2,14,Baljeet,"Okay, everyone. Please return your seats to their upright positions, and please do not panic. As you can see the Paper Pelican is dissolving in water, because it is, after all, made of paper mache. But do not worry, because your seat cushions also function as flotation devices. Thank you for flying with us."
2,14,Phineas,"Oh, there you are Perry."
2,14,Linda,"Well everyday eventful in the emergency room. Candace, you really should be more careful."
2,14,Candace,"Mom, I told you, we had our helmets on. (To Jeremy) So your cousin Nicolette was trapped on a video game level?"
2,14,Jeremy,"Yeah, took her a week to get through it. You didn't really think she did all those things? Candace? Do you mind? (He takes out a pen as to sign her cast)"
2,14,Candace,Yes! I mean no! I mean... Sign it!.
2,14,Candace,"Thanks. Oh, hehe."
2,15,Candace,"Oh, my gosh, Stacy, have you heard? ""About what""? About Jeremy, he's on a TV commercial."
2,15,Stacy,"Yeah, I know. I heard it from Christina, who heard it from Jenny, who heard it from Jessie who heard it from you!"
2,15,Candace,"Well, it's totally true. Do you know what this means?"
2,15,Stacy,He's totally out of your league.
2,15,Candace,He's totally out of my league! What am I going to do?
2,15,Stacy,How should I know? I don’t know anything about celebrity relations.
2,15,Candace,That's it! If I can get on TV then Jeremy will see my star quality and we'll be on the same level again!
2,15,Stacy,How exactly are you going to do that?
2,15,Candace,"I guess you're right, getting on TV might be kinda difficult."
2,15,Stacy,"Yeah, I guess you forgot about that insignificant little detail."
2,15,Candace,"He, he, insignificant little detail, insignificant little... Phineas and Ferb! Stacy you're a genius."
2,15,Stacy,Would you call my mom and tell her that?
2,15,Candace,Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and...! (She runs into the sliding door)
2,15,Phineas,So you just switch the solenoid here with the ganglion there and...
2,15,Candace,Phineas and Ferb.
2,15,Isabella,"Hey, Candace. What'cha dooooin'?"
2,15,Candace,Freaking out. What are you guys doing?
2,15,Phineas,We're helping the Fireside Girls.
2,15,Isabella,"Yeah, we're working on our broadcasting patches."
2,15,Phineas,We're gonna to do a game show. Baljeet and Buford are the contestants. We're even gonna broadcast it all over the Tri-State Area.
2,15,Candace,"Great, I knew I came to the right place. Here's the deal: I'm the star."
2,15,Phineas,"Well, all right then."
2,15,Candace,"(At Baljeet and Buford) Okay, one of you get off the stage."
2,15,Baljeet,Whoa!
2,15,Candace,Right then. Let's get this thing started.
2,15,Phineas,"(At Ferb) You know, we should give Perry a cameo. Hey, where's Perry?"
2,15,Major Monogram,"Ah, Agent P, uh... ahem. Carl and I made a bet, and, well... I lost. (Clears throat)"
2,15,Carl,(In a falsetto voice) Dozens of delivery trucks have been...
2,15,Major Monogram,"This was, uh, part of the bet."
2,15,Carl,"...showing up at Doofenshmirtz's, and no good can come from that. Get to the bottom of it. (Laughs)"
2,15,Major Monogram,This actually wasn’t part of the bet.
2,15,Baljeet,Do not worry your pretty little head. I have plenty of experience with this sort of thing.
2,15,Buford,"(picks up Baljeet) You better, man! My face is my fortune!"
2,15,Baljeet,Of course it is. (chuckles)
2,15,Candace,"(on phone) Yeah, Stacy, the boys are putting on a game show! And I'm the star! This'll totally do it!"
2,15,Stacy,"Well, I hope it does do ""it"", because Jeremy's getting huger by the minute. I know because Megan's blog says she thinks so."
2,15,Candace,No way!
2,15,Phineas,And how are my favorite contestants today.
2,15,Buford,"We're your only contestants, dillweed."
2,15,Phineas,"I just wanted to remind everyone that the physical challenges are a little rigorous, but the rewards are inconsequential. So if things get too rough out there, you can drop out anytime you want."
2,15,Candace,"Oh, don't worry about me. I can handle anything."
2,15,Buford,"If the girl's in, I'm in!"
2,15,Phineas,"Anyway, if you need anything, (snaps fingers) don't bother to speak up."
2,15,Candace,I can't believe my own brother doesn't think I can stick it out. I'll show him. I'm star material here! MAKEUP! (Gretchen hits her with a vaudevillian oversized powderpuff) Let's do this thing!
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, Perry the Platypus, how do you like my new Nemesis Catch-o-Mat? I bought it from the TV. (Perry gives him a look)"
2,15,Ad Man,Buy now for only $5.99 and get—
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,(on phone) I'll take two!
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, I see you've taken notice of all the infomercial products. I seem to have developed an addiction to them. I-It started with the Fruit Dehydrator. Here I've been eating hydrated fruit like a sucker my whole life! (doorbell rings) Excuse me, Perry the Platypus."
2,15,Delivery Guy,Sign here please.
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Ah, my Serve-O-Mat! See, this is what I'm talking about, I don't even know what a Serve-O-Mat is and now I own five. These infomercials are taking time away from my evil. People ask, ""Doof, if you have unwanted infomercials, how do you get rid of them?"" My solution is easy, simple, and it starts working the same day. With my Scorch-inator, I will target TV towers and melt, smelt, and render them into their basic components, thereby eliminating infomercials! And how much would I pay for this? Nothing, it's free! But wait! There's more! N-Th-There's not really any more, that's about it."

2,15,Candace,Fine Tralfazz!
2,15,Phineas,"Ooh, bonus!"
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"What's the matter, Perry the Platypus? You don't like my little plan? Think about it this way: Since infomercials are almost universally hated, I will actually be doing a civic good by destroying them! Huh? You see? You like that? W— Oof! (Perry somehow gets out of the Nemesis Catch-o-Mat, and jumps on Doof. Cut to show Perry holding a device) Aha, yes, the E-Z Automatic Trap Escaper. I must've left it out where you could reach it. Well, I was able to reach this! (He reaches offscreen and retrieves a mallet-looking device) It's the Swapotron-Smash-o-Matic! (a boxing glove comes out of the mallet and punches Perry) I got it for only $99.95. (Perry gets another device) Ah, the Labco Pocket Tennis Ball Launcher provides exquisite (gets hit with a tennis ball) Oof!—accuracy.

2,15,Phineas,Judges?
2,15,Phineas,30 points. Physical challenge!
2,15,Candace,Whadaya mean physical chall— (A mechanical arm pies Candace in the face. Another pair of mechanical arms puts a bag on her head) This doesn't even make any sense!
2,15,Phineas,Wow! A hundred points! Candace is on fire!
2,15,Candace,"Woohoo. I'm not really on fire, am I?"
2,15,Buford,"No, you're good."
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"Heh-heh! How did I find you? Well, it was easy, with my Platy-Positioner satellite global platypus locator. Patent pending. (Perry kicks him.)"
2,15,Buford,Slippery snagglefoot.
2,15,Phineas,"That answer is correct! Candace, do you want the minus two thousand points or do you want another physical challenge?"
2,15,Candace,I'll take another physical challenge.
2,15,Audience,She's taking the physical challenge!
2,15,Coltrane,"Dude, it's so cool you're in this commercial."
2,15,Jeremy,Thanks.
2,15,Coltrane,"Hey, let's see if it's on another channel. Wai-w-w-wait! Is that Candace?"

Doofenshmirtz yells and they charge at each other with their devices. The vacuum-like device sucks Doofenshmirtz's face) The Tornado Vac only needs one setting because of its painfully awesome suction power! (They go out onto the balcony and Doofenshmirtz backs into his Shrinkinator-plant and activates it several times. He gets out a notepad and pencil and writes something.) Shrinkinator, why haven't I unplugged this thing? I keep leaving myself notes, and I keep forgetting. ""Shrinkinator. Unplug Shrinkinator."" (He sticks the note onto the Shrinkinator.) Ugh! I'll do it tomorrow. (Pan to reveal all the notes say essentially the same thing.)"
2,15,Phineas,This is the final question. Winner takes all! (holds up a card) What is—?
2,15,Candace,"Teddy bear stuffing! (covers her mouth, close up on Ferb, close up on the audience) Be a star, Candace! Be a star! Be a star! Come on! Be a star!"
2,15,Buford,Wow. Somebody's got issues.
2,15,Doofenshmirtz,"(after landing near a hamburger flipper) Ha! I'll crush you with my Burgermatic hamburger flipper! (He turns it on, but the top parts simply spins around. He throws it away.) Alright, forget the Burgermatic. Let's see how you fare against my Shrinkinator! (Perry turns it on, and Doofenshmirtz shrinks.) Curse you— (Doofenshmirtz holds up his hand to reveal it is massive.) Hey! Hey, you missed my hand! Oh, now not only am I shrunken, but I'm freakishly shrunken! Curse you, Perry the Pl— (His giant hand practically crushes himself.) Aw, this is kind of heavy."
2,15,Phineas,"Hey, look, our game show set instantaneously miniaturized itself!"
2,15,Ferb,"Well, I suppose we could call that the home version."
2,15,Phineas,"Well, we are home. Let's play it! (Perry chatters) There you are, Perry!"
2,15,Candace,So what? That's it? Who won? I am so busting you guys!
2,15,Jeremy,"Hi, Candace."
2,15,Candace,"Hi, Jeremy."
2,15,Jeremy,"I saw ya on TV and just wanted to congratulate you. I guess you're, like, on a whole new level now."
2,15,Candace,What about your commercial?
2,15,Jeremy,(takes out his smartphone) You mean this?
2,15,(Song,"""Devors"")"
2,15,Jeremy,I was just the foot model.
2,15,Candace,"Hehe, you have hunky ankles. Heh."
2,15,Jeremy,Thanks. I like your...branch.
2,15,Candace,"(takes branch out) Heh-heh, you should have seen me covered in pie."
2,15,Jeremy,What kind of pie?
2,29,Isabella,"Okay, the camera's all ready!"
2,29,Phineas,"We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat, constructed entirely out of playing cards. Hey, where's Candace? I bet she'd love to see this."
2,29,Candace,"""Does He Think You're Pretty Enough? Ten Ways You Could Be.. Better."" Wow. Ten ways? Thank you Quazmo Magazine. (cell phone rings) Jeremy!"
2,29,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. Umm, so listen. I'm really sorry, but something's come up and I won't be able to make it to our date tonight. I hope you understand. Hello? ...Candace, are you there? ...Hello?...Helloo? Well, I guess we got cut off."
2,29,Candace,"He just broke our date and hung up on me. Oh, it's probably not as bad as I think. Let's see what Quazmo has to say about it. (Starts blubbering)"
2,29,Phineas,"Last card. You do the honors, Ferb."
2,29,Candace,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!
2,29,Tarzan look alike,What?
2,29,Phineas,"Umm, hey, Candace. Everything okay?"
2,29,Candace,"Beat it, dweebs! I'm having a crisis!"
2,29,Phineas,Sounds like Candace is in a serious funk. I wonder what we can do to snap her out of it?
2,29,Isabella,"Ooh, I know! It's all right here in Tween Bleep magazine. ""Three Sure-Fire Ways to Lift Your Friend Out of a Serious Funk. Number one: Give her a complete make-over. A completely different look will often do the trick."""
2,29,Phineas,"A completely different look? Come on, Ferb. We need somebody who's good with make-up and fancy hair-dos."
2,29,Isabella,"Umm, okay. I'll just stay here with my ""Expert Makeover"" patches and... Hey, where's Perry?"
2,29,Major Monogram,"Agent P, uuh, well, due to your...reprehensible behavior over the past few days, (screen changes to Perry robot kicking over a trash can) which I can barely believe is even possible (changes to fake Perry stealing cash out of a truck) from an agent of your caliber, (changes to fake him throwing money out the window of a car, then to him eating cereal at his host family's table but that Doofenshmirtz's home and Doofenshmirtz's table)  who has learned nothing but the best in his field I, uhh, uh, actually, I don't know what's particularly bad about this clip here, but, we have no choice but..."
2,29,Carl,Why? Why'd you do it?
2,29,Major Monogram,"Not yet, Carl. Wait till I'm done here. (to Perry) You are officially.. discharged. (to Carl) Okay, now, Carl."
2,29,Carl,Why? Why'd you do it?
2,29,Major Monogram,"Cuff him, boys."
2,29,Major Monogram,Red alert! Red alert! Renegade agent on the run!
2,29,Stacy,Hello?
2,29,Candace,"Stacy, Jeremy has, like, totally lost interest in me!"
2,29,Stacy,What makes you think so?
2,29,Candace,Quazmo magazine!
2,29,Stacy,I'll be right there.
2,29,Candace,"Well, that was almost impossibly fast."
2,29,Candace,"Woah, woah, wait! You're not Stacy! Hey, hey, hey! What is going on? Huh? (Clown pulls out a pie) Uh, wait a minute. Now, don't try anything funny! (Pie splashes in her face)"
2,29,Stacy,"So, are you ready for some cheering up?"
2,29,Candace,"(looks in mirror) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Birds fly, dogs bark, seals jump in water, monkeys beat up Tarzan look-alike.)"
2,29,Phineas,"No biggie, Shlocko, you gave it your best shot."
2,29,Phineas,"In hindsight, a clown may not have been the best choice to do a makeover."
2,29,Isabella,Ya think?
2,29,Phineas,"So, what else does the magazine say?"
2,29,Isabella,"""Step number two: Make her laugh. Laughter is the best medicine."""
2,29,Phineas,Sure! Make her laugh. Candace has a great sense of humor. Remember that time she got her face caught in the sink?
2,29,Stacy,"Okay, how 'bout now we get you some ice cream?"
2,29,Candace,"I don't know, Stacy."
2,29,Phineas,"Good afternoon, ladies."
2,29,Stacy,Or we can do this.
2,29,Phineas,"We have a table reserved for you close to the stage, Miss Flynn."
2,29,Stacy,Oh. This is SO cool.
2,29,Phineas,"(On microphone) Hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody! We havin' fun yet? First up, our favorite math-formula funny man, Baljeet!"
2,29,Baljeet,"(Holding a plastic dummy that looks just like him) Thank you. Thanking you much. So little Jeet, I hear you went to New Delhi. And did you try the chicken club?"
2,29,Little Jeet,"Wow, that's really what you're going with? You know, just do the water drinking bit."
2,29,Baljeet,Okay. The Pythagorean theorem...
2,29,Little Jeet,"The square of the hypotenuse of a right triang... (coughs then head falls off, then Baljeet coughs)"
2,29,Phineas,Let's hear it for the dummy! And that puppet wasn't bad either.
2,29,Phineas,"Next up, my favorite vegetable-based comic, Broccoli Top!"
2,29,Buford,"I'm gonna do some prop comedy for you, and you're gonna like it! Okay, what have we got? (reaches into the box and gets a house) Here's a...here's a house. For, uh...I don't know. A mouse or something. (drops and breaks house; gets a book from his box) Here's a book. Hey, what am I...what am I supposed to do? Read? (throws book) Next! All right, let's see what else we've got! Um, and here's, uh, um... (gets out an oyster shell) An oyster shell, look! My...my mom went to a seafood restaurant...I don't have any...it's just...to me, it's just interesting. I'll put that one back in the box. (puts shell back in box) What else we got? Oh, here we go. Look! (pulls out Baljeet) A nerd to go with the book!"
2,29,Baljeet,I am in both acts.
2,29,Buford,(throws Baljeet off stage and onto Ferb's drum set) Thank you! Buford's still in the building!
2,29,Candace,This isn't making me feel any better.
2,29,Buford,What? You wanna wrestle?
2,29,Phineas,"Coming up next, Ferb Fletcher!"
2,29,Ferb,"Ahem. So, how about that airline food?"
2,29,Candace,"(not laughing along) This, is making me feel worse."
2,29,Stacy,"(still laughing along) Ahahaha, what's airline food?"
2,29,Phineas,(Worried) Doesn't look like it's working.
2,29,Phineas,"So, what does it say for step number three?"
2,29,Isabella,"It says... ""Introduce her to someone new."""
2,29,Phineas,"That should be easy. There are lots of nice people in Danville she's never met. Ferb, I've got an idea."
2,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Hey fellas! Look who decided to make an appearance. (to Perry) You see, it occurred to me that what I really should be doing is fighting fire with fire. And by fire, I mean Perry the Platypus. And by fire, I ALSO mean Perry the Platypus. It occurred to me while I was on fire. I made a bunch of doppelgangers to discredit and totally destroy you. Behold the Plata-Proliferator-inator!"
2,29,Doofenshmirtz,"Meet Terry the Platypus, and say hello to Larry the Platypus, and say aloha to Jerry the Platypus. (shows distorted Perry lookalike) Yeah, he was the first one out of the batch, but you know, he was so cute, I couldn't bear to...(Jerry hits Doofenshmirtz with the pipe he was drooling on) Ow! Ow! No, no Jerry you cannot hit people, you do not... (Jerry hits him again) No, use your words Jerry. (talks to the Perry lookalikes) Anyway, all you guys, go get him!"
2,29,Doofenshmirtz,Yes!
2,29,Doofenshmirtz,Awwwww.
2,29,Candace,"Look at this, Stacy, he won't even answer his cell phone."
2,29,Little Jeet,"Excuse me, Miss Flynn? You and a guest are cordially invited to the Mixer Mingler."
2,29,Candace,"Mixer Mingler? Say, aren't you that dummy from the night club?"
2,29,Little Jeet,She's talking to you.
2,29,Candace,It's obviously some lame attempt from my brothers to cheer me up. I'm not going.
2,29,Stacy,Come on; it will do you good.
2,29,Candace,"(as they climb up the machine) Oh, would you look at this? If I wasn't so depressed, my brothers would be so busted!"
2,29,Phineas,"With the Mix 'n' Mingler, you'll meet someone new every two seconds. Now, let's fire this thing up."
2,29,Phineas,Fasten your seatbelts!
2,29,Candace,I can't believe I'm doing... (The machine starts spinning) AHHHHH!

2,29,Major Monogram,"(tearing up) Congratulations, Agent P. I knew it couldn't be you causing all that trouble. (sobs) You are officially reinstated."
2,29,Stacy,"You know, a little ice cream always makes me feel better."
2,29,Candace,Maybe you're right. I'll have two scoops of...Jeremy? (Jeremy turns around) Jeremy!
2,29,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace."
2,29,Candace,What are you doing here?
2,29,Jeremy,"I didn't wanna break our date. I just wanted to earn some extra money, so I could surprise you."
2,29,Candace,"A surprise, for me? Oh, Jeremy."
2,29,Candace,"Oh, Jeremy! This was so worth the wait."
2,29,Jeremy,I'm just glad you're not one of those people who freaks out just because someone cancels a date.
2,29,Candace,(laughs awkwardly; tosses magazine over her shoulder) Right.
2,17,Candace,"Ugh, no more peach and pumpernickel sandwiches before bed. (Candace trips over Agent P, she looks back) YOU!"
2,17,Candace,"For an animal that doesn't do much, you sure know how to make a mess of things!"
2,17,Major Monogram,"Good morning, Agent P. I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is you're being reassigned to a new, more evil villain. His name: The Regurgitator."
2,17,Carl,"You keep pushing him down, but he keeps coming back up!"
2,17,Major Monogram,"That's not funny, Carl. That's just disgusting."
2,17,Carl,You laughed earlier!
2,17,Major Monogram,"It was a pity laugh. Anyway, Dr. Doofenshmirtz had to be downgraded to minor threat status, and we've just assigned Agent S to his case. The good news is you've been relocated away from your host family to this new family in the Quad-State Area."
2,17,Carl,"(whispering) It's the other way around, sir."
2,17,Major Monogram,"Oh, yes-yes, of course. Bad news is the relocation, and the good news is the new villain thing. Uh...just make sure you take your belongings from the house when you leave."
2,17,Phineas,"Good morning, Candace."
2,17,Candace,What's so great about it?
2,17,Phineas,"Not much. We can't find Perry anywhere. He's never missed breakfast, not even once."
2,17,Candace,"Uhh, you don't think he could've argued with someone, at say... 3:38 am, got his feelings hurt, then run away, do you?"
2,17,Phineas,"Nah, he never would've gone outside on purpose. Everybody knows that platypuses are supposed to stay inside at night. You haven't seen him anywhere, have you?"
2,17,Candace,"(nervously) Well, maybe he just wandered off. Doesn't he always wander off at some point in the day? A-And then later, when he comes back, you say, ""Oh, there you are, Perry"", and he says, (mimics Perry's chatter)"
2,17,Phineas,"Yeah, but he's always here in the morning."
2,17,Phineas,I'd be devastated if something happened to him.
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Hold on, I'm coming! (He opens the door and a gift basket is sitting in outside in the hallway.) Another gift basket? (He takes a card off of it.) (reading) ""We regret to inform you that due to The Regurgitator's recent evil behavior, you have been downgraded to a minor threat. If you believe this to be a mistake, please fill out the included appeal."" A minor threat?! Regurgitator. Ugh, well there's a lot of weirdos out there. (He goes to his computer and types on it) Oh, here we go. He has his own blog. (He reads) ""The World's Most Evil Villain""?! Who does this upstart think he is? It's time to show him who's boss! (He rushes off screen and the towel is laying on the floor, his head appears with a nervous smile as he quickly picks it up.)"
2,17,Phineas,"All right, Ferb. Activate the Platy-Attracker 3000. If Perry's anywhere in Danville, this'll bring him home."
2,17,Phineas,Wow. I didn't know there were so many platypuses in Danville.
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"' Geez, what a dump! (enters into the motel) (mockingly) So much for Mr. Big Shot Super-villain. (walks over to the man at the front desk) Uh, yeah hi. I'm looking for someone named... (Checks piece of paper) Mr. ""The Regurgitator."""
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Do not push?"" Hmm."
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, my Heinz henie! Look at this. All this technology, a giant vacuum tube, and they can't afford a throw pillow? (notices The Regurgitator nearby) Oh, hello."
2,17,The Regurgitator,I am The Regurgitator!
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, okay. My name is Heinz Doofenshmirtz. (pauses) Tadaa! ...Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know have the whole... Where are those lights coming from, by the way, when you do that?"
2,17,The Regurgitator,You're that disturbed lunatic from Danville.
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Oh, you've heard of me?"
2,17,The Regurgitator,"Yes, and you've heard of me!"
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Seriously. Where's that coming... (Notices Perry in a trap) Oh, look, you've already captured Perry the Platypus! My, you do work fast."
2,17,The Regurgitator,Why don't you fill up these forms and I'll consider you for a three-year internship. (hands him some papers before walking away.)
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,I am not here to apply for an internship. (looks at the first sheet) Ooh! You offer maternity leave.
2,17,The Regurgitator,You can start by making a fresh pot of coffee!
2,17,Phineas,"Nope, Ferb, not Perry. This little guy's eyes are too close together and his beak is orange. Perry's is more of a tangerine. Nope, too fat. Too thin. Too cartoon-y. (Holds nose) Whoa, that one smells like meatloaf!"
2,17,Candace,Perry? Perry the Platypus! Huh? (notices a platypus tail sticking around a nearby corner.) Perry! Get over here. (runs over and pulls on the tail) You're coming home with me so I won't get in trouble with the...
2,17,Woman,You have a pet platypus.
2,17,Candace,Touche.
2,17,Phineas,"Nope, too blue. Too angular. Too French. That one's just a duck with a beaver tail taped on. Well, that was the last of them. Maybe we need to think bigger. And with music! Perry just loves music, remember?"
2,17,Phineas,Let's get the guitars. I've got an idea.
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"What are you looking at, Perry the Platypus? This is a great job! And look at all I've accomplished. I mean, just today, I organized this evil invoices, swept his evil lair, picked up his evil dry cleaning. And look, I even had the time to do this, see? ""Best Boss."" And if I do a good job, I could be promoted to head assistant in just three months! Where are you gonna be in three months, huh, huh?"
2,17,The Regurgitator,Never mind the three months. I'll take care of him right now!
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Wait a minute. First of all, he's my nemesis! And you can't get rid of him now. Where's the fun in that? You need to explain your whole plan to him. Don't you have a nemesis?"
2,17,The Regurgitator,"Me? The world is my nemesis! (pauses before clicking some buttons on his watch) Sorry, this thing doesn't always work. The world is my nemesis!"
2,17,Candace,"Perry's gone, and it's...it's just my fault. I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna have to tell the boys. (notices the silhouettes of Phineas and Ferb through a curtain) Oh, there they are. Well, I guess now's as good a time as any. Phineas, Ferb, I just have to tell you that I'm the one who..."
2,17,Marty the Rabbit Boy,Hey.
2,17,Candace,Marty the Rabbit Boy and his musical blender?
2,17,Marty the Rabbit Boy,Maybe this'll make you feel better. (plays the chorus of Gitchee Gitchee Goo on his blender)
2,17,Candace,"Eh, not so much."
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Don't look at me like that, Perry the Platypus. I know what you're thinking. I-I'm not some lowly intern. I'm an evil scientist! I'm Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and he should be bowing down to me! (at the Regurgitator) Hey you, Mr. Regurgitator! Let's get things straight!"
2,17,The Regurgitator,What?
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, okay. (to Perry) See that, Perry the Platypus? Compromise."
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Who am I kidding? Grrr. (at himself as he goes over to The Regurgitator) You can do it, you can do it, you can do it. Okay, Regurgitator! I've done everything for you. See those hard-to-reach files up there? Well I invented these rocket shoes just so you can reach them! And look at this! I even put in the self-destruct button that you forgot!"
2,17,The Regurgitator,What? Why is it counting down?
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"Okay, well, I may have pressed it by mistake. But at least I didn't push the release button I installed inside Perry the Platypus's cage!"
2,17,The Regurgitator,"Look what you've done! You've pushed my buttons for the last time, you disturbed lunatic!"
2,17,The Regurgitator,Now get ready to--(gets sucked up by the vacuum tube) Aaaahhh!
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,We did it! We did it! Lo hicimos! We did it!
2,17,Major Monogram,"Congratulations, Agent P. You've defeated the Regurgitator. As a matter of fact, he just landed in our prison. You can return immediately to your host family, and Dr. Doofenshmirtz is once again your nemesis."
2,17,Doofenshmirtz,"So, if we're enemies again, does that mean... (Perry drops him) Aaaah! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! (tumbles before finally landing on a throw pillow) Oh, now see there, a throw pillow. You, you guys do it right!"
2,17,Phineas,"Excellent. From the top of this building, everyone in the Tri-State Area should be able to hear us."

2,16,Carl,"Excuse me sir. (Holding up booklet entitled ""Seismic Activity and Quakes - by Carl"") I wrote my sophomore thesis on quakes and seismic events. If you want you can check out my website."
2,16,Major Monogram,"Ugh, Carl. Spaghetti."
2,16,Carl,"Oh, that's right! (Drops booklet and runs off screen)"
2,16,Worker,"Hey, here's your delivery, kid. Friction rollers, spot-free rinser, individual driers, turbo spray nozzles, jet powered vacuum, atomic collider."
2,16,Phineas,I suppose you're going to ask me if I'm to young to use this stuff.
2,16,Worker,"Nah, just try not to blow a hole through the earth's core, or we'll both be in deep doody."
2,16,Phineas,Okay.
2,16,Candace,"Stacy, I sent Jeremy a text message twelve minutes ago and he still hasn't answered. You don't think I'm making a big deal out of this?"
2,16,Stacy,No way.
2,16,Candace,"What am I going to do, Stacy?"
2,16,Stacy,You've got to play hard to get.
2,16,Candace,Hard to get?
2,16,Stacy,"Jeremy thinks you'll go with him anywhere, anytime, just for the asking. Don't be a lapdog, Candace. Just say no!"
2,16,Candace,"Uh-oh, Stacy. That's Jeremy. (Presses button on phone to talk to Jeremy) Hello?"
2,16,Jeremy,"Hey, Candace. I'm taking my mom's car to this crazy new car wash. Would you like to go for a ride?"
2,16,Candace,"A car? That is so grown up. I mean, hold please? (Presses button on phone to talk to Stacy.) Stacy, Jeremy is asking me out for a ride, in a car!"
2,16,Stacy,"Wow, that's so grown up! But you gotta be strong. Remember, hard to get."
2,16,Candace,"Right, hard to get. I'll call you back. (Presses button on phone to talk to Jeremy.) Umm, about the car and the ride, I would love to (Candace screams. Jeremy holds the phone away from his ear as the force of Candace's scream makes his hair blow back.) Wait, I mean, I better check my schedule. (Covers phone and hums victory music to herself). You're in luck. I can just squeeze you in."
2,16,Jeremy,Great. Pick you up later.
2,16,Candace,"(Puts down phone.) Ahh, Jeremy. (Presses button on phone to talk to Stacy.) Stacy, I am like so hard to get right now. It's like totally-- (Notices the construction outside her window.) Wait, what in the... Gotta go, Stacy."
2,16,Phineas,"Alright, Ferb. Let's test out the turbo-charged uber-nozzle."
2,16,Candace,(From her window.) What the heck is going-- (Gets cut off mid sentence as she is sprayed by water from the turbo-charged uber-nozzle.)
2,16,Phineas,It works!
2,16,"(Perry walks by ""Anti-Platypus Security"" sign, runs down a hallway consisting of a series of dangerous traps","spiked doors, laser beams, fish, swinging blades. He opens an air vent and drops into Doofenshmirtz's apartment.)"
2,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Well, it looks like that anti-platypus security system was a total waste of money. I am so taking that back."
2,16,Doofenshmirtz,"Thank goodness for old reliable traps, huh? I'm so glad you're going to hang around. (Laughs) Anyway, you arrived just in time to witness the unveiling of my latest invention. Let me introduce to you the Mountain-out-of-a-Molehill-inator. All my life, I was told, (Begin a series of flashbacks) ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill,"" ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill,"" ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill."" Well now I intend to do just that. This machine will infuse electricity into a small little sphere of compressed nitrogen molecules, which I will then drop into the earth and it will make all the tiny little molehill molecules grow and grow into enormous mo-- (Stops mid-sentence) You know, it's kind of complicated. I learned about it on some kid's website. (Shows computer monitor with Carl's website on the screen.) Oh, oh, and you know what else I found on the web? It's these pictures of cats and they write these—oh, l-l-l-look at this one, ""Invisible Cheeseburger"". (Perry, still upside-down, looks unimpressed.) No, huh? Well, it's not for everyone, I just think they're funny. Anyway, so I take the sphere, electrify it, drop it in the ground, ta-da! Mountains! Out of molehills! (Perry unimpressed) I know when people say that, they usually mean it figuratively, it's an analogy, bu-bu-but making a point, I can do whatever I want."
2,16,Baljeet,I will be honest. I think we look ridiculous.
2,16,Buford,"Are you kiddin'? (Flips his sign, stands on his hands, and holds it with his feet.) I make this look good."
2,16,Phineas,"Okay, Ferb, let's fire this baby up!"
2,16,(Song,"""Phintastic Ferbulous Car Wash"")"
2,16,Candace,"Oh, they are so busted! Alright, you dweebs, what's going on here? (walking into the conveyor belt) I don't have time for this! I've got a huge date and—AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!"

2,16,Jeremy,(on phone) Well...
2,16,Jeremy,I'm havin' a hard time gettin' there. (Cut to outside the car to reveal a huge traffic jam.) Looks like the whole town is going to this cool new car wash.
2,16,Jeremy,(on phone) I might have to make it some other time.
2,16,Candace,"Wait, no! I-I mean I've got to put you on hold. (picks up other call) Stacy! Wow, I can't believe you're still there."
2,16,Stacy,"So how is ""hard to get"" working?"
2,16,Candace,Working? Now I'm impossible to get! And now Jeremy's playing hard to get.
2,16,Phineas,"Wow! This car wash is really hoppin'! At this rate, the star-nosed mole will be saved in no time!"
2,16,Candace,"Phineas, I'd love to bust you, but if you don't speed up this car wash, I'm going to miss my date with Jeremy!"

2,16,Phineas,"(on intercom) ¡Accelerado, por favor! (Ferb pulls a couple of levers and the wash and the song speed up.)"
2,16,Candace,Wait! Too fast! (She spins around the roofs of the cars before the belt stops and she lands on the windshield of Jeremy's car.)
2,16,Jeremy,Wow! That was quite an entrance!
2,16,Candace,"Jeremy! Heh-heh, heh, heh, you made it! Oh, I must look like a wreck."
2,16,Jeremy,"No, you look great! Hop in! (Candace opens the side door and gets in.) What'd you do to your hair?"
2,16,Candace,Hot wax...and a sealer I think.
2,16,Jeremy,I like it! I'm really glad that you're goin' with me.

2,16,Doofenshmirtz,"I put an energy whatchamacallit in here and... (pushes the remote, nothing happens. Pushes it rapidly several times, still nothing happens.) Nice. (He walks up to an electrical fuse-tank and opens a small door and gets a battery out.) Wow, these things go fast. I guess I need a new battery. (Looks in his electrical toothbrush) Nope. (Looks in a toy car.) Nope. (Looks in a flashlight.) Uh-uh. (Looks in Frankenstein's monster's head.) Not here. (Looks in a cymbal-banging monkey toy.) Nope. (Looks in his radio.) Ah! Nope. (Looks in his smoke detector.) Nope. (Looks in his alarm clock.) Nope. (Looks in Norm's butt.) No. (Cut to Doof holding a new battery.) Finally! (He loses his grip on the battery and it goes under the fridge.) Ah, dangit!! Oh, sorry, Perry, I didn't mean to get all street there. But now (bends down) it's probably got all that grease and refrigerator fluff on it. Oh, there's my retainer! (He puts it in his mouth off screen.)"

(A giant boot crushes the inator. We pan down all the floors of the building as the energy ball goes through every one of them.) You know, in hindsight, I probably shoulda done this in the basement."
2,16,Phineas,Wow. I guess that's who's been eating Mom's hydrangeas.
2,16,Phineas,"Well, looks like they're safe now."
2,16,Doofenshmirtz,"It's workiiiing! It's workiiiiiiiiing!! And so much better than I thought it would!
